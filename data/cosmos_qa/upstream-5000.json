Also , somebody remind me next time I want to line something with mulberry paper - find some other material , because mulberry paper is very porous , quickly gets saturated with liquid glue ( I used my bookbinding glue , because that 's what I glue paper with ) , and when it 's wet , it tears . Now that can be a good thing if you want a nice uneven edge , but when you 're trying to smooth it onto a surface , not so good . So the inside of the box has patches here and there , but it 's dark purple paper , and wo n't show .\nQuestion: Why did they use mulberry paper in the first place ?\nOptions: \nA.
