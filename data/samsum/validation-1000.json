Thursday or Friday around lunchtime are free:\r\nMartin: How about I take you to lunch on Friday? \r\nSusan: OK, 1 o'clock?\r\nMartin: That sounds good. What kind of food do you like?\r\nSusan: Oh anything. I am not fussy.\r\nMartin: Maybe Italian?\r\nSusan: Well, I actually have a gluten intolerance so pasta and pizza are both off the menu for me. That makes Italian a bit tricky.\r\nMartin: How about Thai?\r\nSusan: I get a bit of a reaction to spicy food, maybe something less hot?\r\nMartin: There's a great new Steak House on Station Road, they do really good rib-eye steaks\r\nSusan: We can do that if you want, but I'm actually vegetarian.\r\nSusan: Except for chickens. Chickens are OK\r\nMartin: There's a nice Vegan place doing vegan sushi on London Road. How does that sound?\r\nSusan: That sounds perfect. I have an allergy to soy and peanuts, but probably I will be able to find something on the menu there. \r\nMartin: OK, then. It is called Edamame. I'll meet you there on Thursday at one.\r\nMartin: Will you be able to bring the book you talked about, that you were going to lend me?\r\nSusan: Ah, yes, \"the Source\" by Mitchener.

Maybe want something bigger in the future but nothing urgent/\r\nDiane: I see... I kinda wish we hadn'tt got such a big one to begin with. Cleaning is a nightmare and our usual cleaner moved away so we gotta find someone new.\r\nLarry: Sure you can find someone on fb, try some local groups, people offer all sort of services all the time. \r\nDiane: Yeah, thats probably what we're gonna end up doing.

Another beautiful theory - nationalist in its core, after all.\r\nHenning: And I agree with neither the first nor the second assessment.\r\nMax: me neither. Being honest I don't see huge differences throughout Europe. It happens to me to meet a very nice waiter here and there, and grumpy people as well\r\nHenning: No, so far i find Italian waiters much nicer and much less professional than in Germany. But I wouldn't venture any theories about the countries.\r\nMax: Jakob (the Slovene) told me after coming back from Berlin that waiters there are so much less nice than here in Italy. While Jakob (the Pole) always complains about them being so rude in comparison with Poland.\r\nHenning: Berlin is a big city though\r\nMax: And I am starting to think that all those theories say more about their authors than about the waiters and the countries. They are always nationally framed, which is stupid\r\nHenning: Maybe. Also our position, when I am in a restaurant in Germany I am often with my family, in Italy with a bunch of fun young, foreign people.\r\nMax: Paris is a different world than Bretagne I assume. In a small village. Of course, there is more of talking, touching, joking in Italy. But people in Germany, in Landshut are also more talkative than in Munich. That's all, I believe. Aaso it depends how touristic the place is, etc.\r\nMax: It's also about the general culture of eating out, talking to waiters, anonymity of the big city. \r\nMax: Especially between societies as diverse and generally as similar as France and Italy, just think about Genova and Nice!\r\nMax: just bullshit!

She can't eat chocolate, but I know she loves exotic flavours like mango, lime, passion fruit.\r\nSara: Ok! Do you want to have something written on the cake? Is she interested in something in particular? Like cats, horses, painting?\r\nJames: I think she'll be happy with some decorations.
