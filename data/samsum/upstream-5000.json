It might as well remain unaffected. I mean the epidermis, the skin itself. Though I'd expect it to develop a bruise.\r\nAndy: Are you coughing? Coughing blood?\r\nBrenda: God! No! I'll see how I feel in the morning. I just need a rest. I feel so rotten, bro...\r\nAndy: My worry would be that you've damaged something inside you.

Happy New Year to you too! Am in Cuba at the moment. What a country!\r\nDennis: Never been there myself but it's on my itinerary. What's it like?\r\nLaura: A bit tough, truth to tell, but you'd like it. Abject living conditions for local people but we're in a \"touristy\" cocoon, so one easily overlooks the other side. Splendid landscapes, incredible architecture but in a more than sorry state of preservation. I love and hate to be here at the same time.\r\nDennis: So you aren't travelling alone, I presume.\r\nLaura: No, my travelling companion takes me along, so to speak, to his winter quarters, since his health doesn't cope that well with European winters. I couldn't afford these travels entirely on my own of course.\r\nDennis: Always thought Cuba is not expensive. Especially the post-Fidel Cuba.\r\nLaura: Just the contrary. In the good old days when it was supported by the Soviet Union, the living standard was not bad and they didn't have to rely on income from tourism. Then it all went down the drain, even famine and food rationing have become their daily thing. Since early 00s most not rationed goods are available only for CUC, their convertible currency. The bottom line being that whatever you buy as a tourist, you pay +/- western prices.\r\nDennis: So how much do you two spend daily?\r\nLaura: Staying in private houses about at least 100\u20ac, including food, transport and entrance fees. These days we are compelled to stay at a state-run Hotel and pay thru the nose - 130\u20ac a night. No, Cuba is not cheap. But Havana Club YES.\r\nDennis: Don't like the stuff at all.\r\nLaura: Me neither. Gives me headaches.

Quite a pretty and comfy place for that and entirely for us alone.\r\nWilliam: <file_photo>\r\nWilliam: So we finally had a goodnight's sleep, did some sightseeing in the capital of Yucatan today and are looking forward to reconnoiter the area tomorrow.\r\nWilliam: <file_photo>\r\nHobbs: Hi there!

But they'll pick up the continuation once they needed it. Practically minded as they are. And how did you like the city itself?\r\nWilliam: We got stuck on the Plaza Mayor, this being Sunday. It was turned into a market square with stalls offering local food, craftsmanship products and household goods, surprising un-touristy. In front of Palacio del Gobierno, a supreme show of dancing in local costumes.\r\nWilliam: <file_photo>\r\nHobbs: Did you manage to get to the balcony of the Palacio on the first floor and get some photos from there?\r\nWilliam: But of course!\r\nWilliam: <file_photo>\r\nWilliam: Theresa tried to prevent me from trespassing but you know me.

Took my breath away for a sec. I even yelled or groaned or gasped. Anyway I was on the floor, shocked. Absolutely shocked. I thought, so that's how it happens. But I managed to get up and didn't realise the pain until I stretched to put my nighty on. Oh bro... Horrible....\r\nAndy: You could have killed yourself. Where are you now?\r\nBrenda: In bed.

A rib?\r\nBrenda: No, then I'd be howling with pain. It's just the impact of the fall that has, I don't know, damaged the tissue. Whatever I have here. Fat I suppose. It has to heal by itself.\r\nAndy: Can you breath normally?\r\nBrenda: Yes. I can't take a deep breath though.\r\nAndy: Can you touch your bruised side? Is it swollen? Red?\r\nBrenda: I can touch it, not press of course, but stroke. No, it isn't swollen. The skin is as usual, no discolouration. But this will come later, I suppose.\r\nAndy: Not necessarily. It might as well remain unaffected. I mean the epidermis, the skin itself. Though I'd expect it to develop a bruise.\r\nAndy: Are you coughing? Coughing blood?\r\nBrenda: God! No! I'll see how I feel in the morning. I just need a rest. I feel so rotten, bro...\r\nAndy: My worry would be that you've damaged something inside you. You know, split spleen, punctured lung.That sort of thing.You just watch your body.\r\nBrenda: Yes, I will. I understand what you mean. I thought so as well. Just see how I feel tomorrow morning.

Well, as a matter of fact I have built a train track before, but it was a short, straight one. I'm sure I could manage a circular one too.\r\nEloise: Oh, that would be fabulous! We are so looking forward to getting an idea what it would look like all finished.\r\nRick: Well, as I mentioned last week, I am drawing up the schematic digitally and will run through it when I come on Tuesday afternoon.\r\nEloise: Great, I am so excited to have a look at it! Don't forget the rose arbour, will you? Or the futuristic section with the steel and the crystal orb. And then there's the cottage garden part too! \r\nRick: Of course! I am having a bit of trouble sourcing the vibrating crystal orb, Eloise. It looks like it will have to be custom made, adding to the cost.\r\nEloise: We don't mind the cost, we've been saving up for years and this will be our fantasy garden when it's finished!\r\nRick: Well, that's OK, then. Also, I'm a bit worried about the maze at the bottom, what with the pond and duck island down there too, may be a bit of a squeeze.\r\nEloise: Well, OK,  scrap the maze, but don't forget the train track, we wanted to give the grandkids a surprise so make sure the train and track are big enough to ride on. We even thought about charging people to ride around the garden in the summer.\r\nRick: Well, I don't see why you shouldn't give it a go, after all the garden will look stunning when it's done.\r\nEloise: I hope so! We're dying to see your plans on Tuesday!\r\nRick: Yes, and you can also see it in 3D to get the full effect!\r\nEloise: Wow! Isn't technology wonderful these days!\r\nRick: Right, I'll see you on Tuesday at 2pm!\r\nEloise: Phil and I will both be there this time.\r\nRick: That's great....",

It's been a long time since we contacted each other-I think it's because of something in FictionPress. It happened to my other fellow writers too. So anyway, I just wanted to say hi. I haven't forgotten about you, dear first FictionPress buddy.  :D\r\nMelina: Hey!! I'm so sorry for not being in contact with you. I keep meaning to write, and having to put it off because of something or another. So how are you? Written anything new recently? I recently wrote a poem which I most soon... And I'm glad you wrote :) xx\r\nJada: I'm great! Today at school we learned hockey, and I discovered that I pretty good as a striker, but not as a goalie. :P So I posted my story so far on FictionPress, and another story, and a story that was chosen to be sent to a competition. Unfortunately, that story did not make it to the finals. :D I'm fine about it. My teacher was still proud of me. So what's your poem about? I've been reading more FanFiction things, I like reading them. \r\nMelina: Nice... Hockey's fun, but I prefer basketball or running. You planning on joing any clubs? :)\r\nMelina: Lately I haven't been writing as much :( My creative juices are running pretty low. But I'm going to have to check out your stories!! :) Had any reviews yet? ANd well done for getting one sent to that competition! As for winning... there's always other opportunities :)\r\nJada: Oh, believe me, I prefer running too... I can;t join any after-school clubs, because my dad didn't want to learn how to drive in Hong Kong, since Hong Kong drove on the opposite side of Shanghai, aka on the right side of the road. My dad was afraid his instincts might come back again and he might start driving on the left side of the road, so we didn't but a car. And I was too lazy to join any other clubs, and besides, Battle of the Books was just reading. Just reading and memorizing authors and book names, which didn't appeal to me, even though I love reading.\nGiven the above dialogue, write a summary.",

The cheeses were rarer so I don't think they wanted to give out too many pieces of them. Stuff like Wensleydale, Tilsiter. There were only five and I can't remember them all.\r\nRoger: and what about the final round.\r\nMandy: That was the best three from the second round, with blindfolds on, up in the front.

Another beautiful theory - nationalist in its core, after all.\r\nHenning: And I agree with neither the first nor the second assessment.\r\nMax: me neither. Being honest I don't see huge differences throughout Europe. It happens to me to meet a very nice waiter here and there, and grumpy people as well\r\nHenning: No, so far i find Italian waiters much nicer and much less professional than in Germany. But I wouldn't venture any theories about the countries.\r\nMax: Jakob (the Slovene) told me after coming back from Berlin that waiters there are so much less nice than here in Italy. While Jakob (the Pole) always complains about them being so rude in comparison with Poland.\r\nHenning: Berlin is a big city though\r\nMax: And I am starting to think that all those theories say more about their authors than about the waiters and the countries. They are always nationally framed, which is stupid\r\nHenning: Maybe. Also our position, when I am in a restaurant in Germany I am often with my family, in Italy with a bunch of fun young, foreign people.\r\nMax: Paris is a different world than Bretagne I assume. In a small village. Of course, there is more of talking, touching, joking in Italy. But people in Germany, in Landshut are also more talkative than in Munich. That's all, I believe. Aaso it depends how touristic the place is, etc.\r\nMax: It's also about the general culture of eating out, talking to waiters, anonymity of the big city. \r\nMax: Especially between societies as diverse and generally as similar as France and Italy, just think about Genova and Nice!\r\nMax: just bullshit!

A couple of years ago I would be crazy excited about this film.\nJane: Now I'm only thinking - another serial killer, another film about psychopaths and murderers, it seems awfully tedious\nSandra: I think I get what you mean\nBrian: Maybe it's different and you should give it a shot? The same rule applies to films about love\nJane: I guess so, but I now kind of enjoy more films in which people don't murder each other\nJane: Maybe it is the age thing after all, I don't think I can handle all those negative emotions to that extent\nSandra: I never liked films like that exactly because of that\nSandra: You can just watch daily news instead of an horror\nBrian: I'd give it a go if I were you, wait a bit and watch it.

Have you read/watched something interesting lately? :)\r\nHank: I read a book recently called: Project Life - Don't stop. The author writes about how he changed his approach to life, about his illness which consequently made him live life to the fullest, it's a really motivating book. To be honest, I rarely read, but you did just ask what I've been reading recently, he he :D What's the film about? Is it worth seeing??\r\nBrenda: That's cool :) The book sounds pretty interesting :P The film is (as the name suggests) about the band Queen (maybe you like their music?), but it focuses  especially on the life of Freddie Mercury (the lead singer) and I have to admit, the film was really well done and also gives you something to think about ;)\r\nHank: That's awesome! As for the band, I know a few of their songs, I probably don't realise that some belong to them, he he, I'm not one of their greatest fans :P",

I know its not your fault and that you are helping I didn't want to go to a solicitor as I thought that would be long and drawn out but this is ridiculous..  I bought the car in good faith for 850 over 2 and a half months ago i'm paying tax and insurance that has cost me 180 for a car that i have not driven for more than 30 miles.  I've been waiting for it to be fixed from the first week.  Can you not persuade him to just give me my money back\r\nCarly: the lack of communication is making matters worse I am already ill which is why I needed a car for the hospital appointments, this is making life worse.\r\nDon: I thought it was going to be back today hun I'll try to find out what is going on\r\nCarly: He's promised tomorrow now, so I hope he does so\r\nDon: Me to hun\r\nCarly: Just to let you know.. the 206 is not fixed and I am out of patience.. if David does not offer me my money back I am using the solicitor that Macmillan put me in touch with.  I am devastated that after all this time he has left me with a car that I would never be able to sell let alone drove safely.  I feel very sorry for you, you must be very embarrassed to be his mother, I hope that no one ever rips anyone off in your family should they ever get ill.",

Could you maybe recommend me something?\nAnna: Hi John! I bought my first cross trainer a couple of years ago and I have been using one ever since. The type of the machine greatly depends on your built and how much many you would like to spend.\nJohn: My budget is quite limited as is the space in my living room\u2026\nMichael: I\u2019d advise you to first measure the room to know how big the machine can actually be for you to exercise comfortably and effectively.\nTom: Waste of money, most expensive cloth hanger\nJohn: Hahaha, I hope it won\u2019t be in my case. I\u2019m quite determined to lose some weight. I\u2019m tall and a bit overweight, so I worry that I may break the machine\nAnna: Don\u2019t worry about that. It shouldn\u2019t be a problem, but have a look at the specs just in case.\nMichael: When it comes to the price, cheaper models don\u2019t have as many electronic options as the more expensive do, but I\u2019d advise you to invest in it if you\u2019re being serious about losing weight.\nJohn: Why\u2019s that?\nMichael: You can always exercise with your phone and an app, but it\u2019s not the most comfortable way (tried it myself). It\u2019s good to have at least three preinstalled programmes like weight-loss, interval, etc. Then the machine will think for you.\nAnna: My first cross trainer didn\u2019t have such options and I must admit that I was also training with my phone and keeping my times. Now, when the old broke, I bought a \u201cfancier\u201d model and I definitely don\u2019t regret it\nJohn: Do you have any company you can recommend? Or a specific model?\nSusan: I have OBE8731 Powerstride 18\" Rear Drive and I think it\u2019s ok.\nAnna: I think that in case of cross trainer it really goes down to the price range. You won\u2019t be able to buy a really good equipment cheaply.\nMichael: I agree, especially if you\u2019re determined and interested in your scores. It may sound silly, but I think tracking your progress helps to lose weight.\nJohn: Thank you so much for your advice!...",

So why did you choose Chloe?\r\nHaley: Because it's actually the one person that you truly care about. Who's like your best friend and means something to you. You've tried so hard for her and now you're just gonna throw that all away and kill her? I just couldn't do it.\r\nNick: Yes, but that's one life against several thousands of lives including Chloe's mother. How do you think that would make her feel?\r\nHaley: I know and as I said it was a devastating choice, but I couldn't let her die after all that emotional build-up.\r\nNick: I sorta get it... in theory. But for me the math was simple. Plus there was this part where you had to see the damage the storm had done and save your classmates and all that. It really got to me.\r\nHaley: I know all that but it was just... pursuit of happiness I guess. Like if it was Josie or your mom, what would you do?\r\nNick: yeah, but for me it wasn't a Josie/mom kind of relationship. Chloe and Max just spent several days together after some long years of zero contact.

Be careful tho, he might start playing with them just to stop later and get a treat or something - reward the times when he's near the pillow in a playful mood and doesn't touch them. And most importantly - get him some toys. He might just need something to play with.\r\nLogan: Yeah, I got him several toys, but they might not be enough.\r\nVince: Maybe something more pillow-like?

Did they have a look into your travel bag? ;)\r\nDoris: That's it! It's all based on trust. They ask you not to and trust you follow suit. You know they have a shop here, as we're miles away in the sticks, open 24 hrs, with food produce, cosmetics, preserves, postcards and that stuff. And it has an open till!

Keep it up!\r\nLeon: How is your stay in Trinidad? Have you found good accommodation?\r\nDanny: Much to our shame I have to admit that we decided to stay in Las Cuevas, a state-run hotel. And that for a simple reason that airbnb doesn't list anything sensible and we didn't want to risk walking around the town dragging our suitcases and ask around for a room to rent. This hotel is just an easy option for us. It is quite OK, a bit too expensive, but in fact quite comfortable.\r\nLeon: I know the place. They have been in operation for nearly 60 years!\r\nDanny: Yes, we know. It was built as a motel for American tourist touring Cuba by car. But the politics had a different plan for them. Yet they seem to be doing fine with package tours.\r\nLeon: And organizing conferences and similar things. They are quite famous for it. I hope their food is alright for you.\r\nDanny: It's only breakfast as we prefer to eat in town. Every day a new place! Trinidad is absolutely fantastic for food with its choice of nearly a 100 restaurants. Pity so many of them are definitely too expensive for us. They are so beautiful!\r\nLeon: Sorry to hear that. But a fancy interior doesn't mean necessarily good food, does it?\r\nDanny: Not at all. We are absolutely happy with the place we've visited so far. The food was always excellent and the decor interesting. Very atmospheric places!\r\nLeon: Glad to hear it.

Thank you for contacting me, I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent?\r\nTom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest?\r\nDiana: It depends on what you value more, it may sound obvious, but if you value stability more than flexibility, I would suggest you invest in buying a flat.\r\nTom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.\r\nDiana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so you could save for later.\r\nTom: Thank you! This is a great advice!\r\nTom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.\r\nDiana: How many rooms are you looking for?\r\nTom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.\r\nDiana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood?\r\nTom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.\r\nDiana: Thank you.
