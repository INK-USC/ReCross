And how many are coming? Did you say about 12?\n\nW: Yes, they said 12 at first, but changed to 10 this morning.\n\nM: Good, we have 8 weeks to prepare, here are my suggestions. On the first day, a welcome party, then they can visit the schools in the district on the second and third days.\n\nW: We've got to remember this group wants to look at how computers are being used in the classroom.\n\nM: Exactly, so I want to ask Mr. Goodman to give them a talk on this on the afternoon of the third day.\n\nW: That will fit in very nicely.\n\nM: And on the last day, they would do some sightseeing, we could take them on the tour of London but many of them may have been there already, and Scotland will be too far away.\n\nW: Why not take them for a walk along the coast, it should be interesting.\n\nM: Good idea! Cathy I'm sure they'll like it."

I'm at a convention from Mexico and the manager of the hotel where I'm staying suggested that I call you.\n\nW: Well, I see. What seems to be the problem?\n\nM: Well, I got this ringing in my ears. It's so terrible that I can hardly hear people talking now.\n\nW: Are you in any pain or is there any fluid?\n\nM: No discharge, just a slight earache.\n\nW: Does the pain happen all the time, or once in a while.\n\nM: It has been aching for two days and it's never stopped. I thought it might be due to my flying in the air, and after some rest it'll be all gone. But who knows it's getting worse. I need to see the doctor.\n\nW: The doctor will be busy at the hospital until this evening. The earliest you could see him would be tomorrow morning at ten.\n\nM: The time is good for me. I'll come in then if that's okay.\n\nW: That will be fine; in the meantime you should try to take it easy. Don't press your ear and don't have water in when you take a shower.\n\nM: Do I have to bring something when I'm seeing the doctor, since I have never seen a doctor in Canada.\n\nW: For foreign visitors, I guess you may bring your passport for the hospital registration.\n\nM: Yes, I will. Thank you for your help.\n\nW: Thanks for calling. See you.\n\nQuestion: What advice does the woman give the man? \n\n- Call a doctor.\n\n- Go to the hospital.\n\n- Get some rest.",

He wasn't there long though because his mother passed away just four years later. Jimmy's father sent him back to Indiana after that to live with his aunt.\n\nW: So how did he get into acting?\n\nM: Well, first he acted in plays at high school, then he went to college in California where he got seriously into acting. In 1951 he moved to New York to do more stage acting.\n\nW: Then when did his movie career really start?\n\nM: 1955. His first starring role was in East of Eden. It was fabulous. Dean became a huge success. But the movie that really made him famous was his second one, Rebel Without a Cause, that was about teenagers who felt like they didn't fit into society.\n\nW: So how many more movies did he make?\n\nM: Just one more, then he died in that car crash in California in 1955.\n\nW: What a tragedy! He only made three movies! So what made him the legend he still is today?\n\nM: Well I guess his looks, his acting ability, his short life, and maybe the type of character he played in his movies.

Do people send the fax messages abroad, or is it just to this country?\n\nM: It's surprising because when I started, I thought I'd be sending things to London and maybe Birmingham but, in fact, a high percentage of it is sent abroad, because it's immediate and speedy.\n\nW: And how much would it cost, for example, if I wanted to send a fax to the United States?\n\nM: Well, a fax to the United States would cost you five pounds for a page. And when you think that in England by the Royal Mail, it would cost you twelve pounds to send a page by special delivery, it's actually a good value.\n\nW: Ok. What about your hours? How long do you have to spend actually in the shop?\n\nM: Well, the shop is open from eight in the morning until six at night, six days a week, and then a sort of fairly flexible morning on a Sunday. Urn, and of those hours, I'm in it quite a lot.\n\nW: And did you enjoy it?\n\nM: Yes, overall I enjoy it. Running a business by yourself is hard work and you never quite like every aspect all the time. 95% of the customers I love. Uh, 2% I really, you know, I'm not too bothered about. And 3% I positively hate.\n\nW: What, what's the problem with those?\n\nWhat would the listener say?",

What's the usual temperature there?\n\nM: Mmm, the temperature in Scotland is 22, or 23 degrees Centigrade, on average, I think. But Cambridge would be warmer, around 25, I would guess, because it's down south.\n\nW: Oh, that's nice. Do you know it is 34 here? Last year it reached 39. By the way, where do you think I should stay?\n\nM: Oh, that's important. You can, err,.., I suppose, stay in the college-owned flats, which are often near where you have your classes, and some are even on the campus. That would certainly be convenient.\n\nW: Yes, it would.\n\nM: But it can also be a disadvantage because you are, in a sense, separated from ordinary society. You're a language teacher, and I think learning from society is a valuable experience.\n\nW: Yes, yes, exactly, so what's the alternative?\n\nM: Maybe finding an English host family.
