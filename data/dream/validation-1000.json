You can't see it.\n\nM: I am glad you asked that. Actually when an inventor has a patent, it's enforceable by the laws in the country where the inventor developed the invention. If anyone makes and sells the product then the inventor can take them to civil court.\n\nW: What can the inventor expect to receive if he sues and wins?\n\nM: Well, there are different things the court could do, but there's no guarantee. There's a good chance the court could award him compensation and orders to stop the manufacture and sale of goods. It may well be that the goods would be ordered to be destroyed.\n\nW: Can the other person being sued do anything to help themselves?\n\nM: That's the beauty of the whole thing. Ignorance of the law doesn't count, I'm afraid. However, the other person can counter-sue pretending that they were actually the original inventor.\n\nW: You said the inventor is protected by the laws of the country. Is everything equal? Do all countries have the same law?\n\nM: No, they're not all equal. You're right. It's only in theory. It is being worked on. The World Trade Organization has developed an agreement, Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which makes sure that the patent is valid for 20 years.\n\nW: That doesn't make sense. Twenty years is a long time.\n\nM: Actually, it does. It's believed that inventors make and sell goods faster after they register the patent because there's a 20-year limitation on the patent.

But while I'm there I'd also like to do some sightseeing.\n\nM: That's nice, Shelly. But do you mean the province of Quebec, or Quebec City?\n\nW: I mean the province. My friend's wedding is in Montreal. I'm going there first. I'll stay for five days. Is Montreal the capital city of the province?\n\nM: Well, Many people think so because it's the biggest city. But it's not the capital. Quebec City is. But Montreal is great. The Saint Royal River runs right through the middle of the city. It's beautiful in summer.\n\nW: Wow, and do you think I can get by in English? My French is OK, but not that good. I know most people there speak French, but can I also use English?\n\nM: Well, People speak both French and English there. But you'll hear French most of the time. And all the street signs are in French. In fact, Montreal is the third largest French speaking city in the world. So you'd better practice your French before you go.\n\nW: Good advice. What about Quebec City? I'll visit a friend from college who lives there now. What's it like?\n\nM: It's a beautiful city, very old. Many old buildings have been nicely restored. Some of them were built in the 17th or 18th centuries. You'll love there.\n\nW: Fantastic. I can't wait to go.\n\nQuestion: What does the man say about the Quebec City? \n\n- It's most beautiful in summer.\n\n- It has many historical buildings.\n\n- It was greatly expanded in the 18th century.",

But when I went there in 1982, I planned to stay for only 6 months.\n\nM: Why did you change your mind?\n\nW: Well, I'm a designer. I design leather goods, mainly shoes, and handbags. Soon after I arrived in Florence, I got a job with one of Italy's top fashion houses, Ferregamo. So, I decided to stay.\n\nM: How lucky! Do you still work for Ferregamo?\n\nW: No, I've been a freelance designer for quite a long time now. Since 1988, in fact.\n\nM: So, does that mean you design for several different companies now?\n\nW: Yes, that's right. I've designed many fashion items for a number of Italian companies, and during the last four years, I've also been designing for the British company, Burberry's.\n\nM: What have you been designing for them?\n\nW: Mostly handbags, and small leather goods.\n\nM: Has the fashion industry in Italy changed since 1982?\n\nW: Oh, yes. It has become a lot more competitive. Because of quality of products from other countries has improved a lot. But the Italian quality and design is still world-famous.\n\nM: And do you ever think of returning to live in England?\n\nW: No, not really. Working in Italy is more interesting.

At the moment, I'm hoping to get onto a Ph.D program.\n\nM: What excites you about drama?\n\nW: Well, I find it's a communicative way to study people and you learn how to read people in drama. So usually I can understand what people are saying even though they might be lying.\n\nM: That would be useful.\n\nW: Yeah, it's very useful for me as well. I'm an English lecturer, so I use a lot of drama in my classes such as role plays. And I ask my students to create mini-dramas. They really respond well. At the moment, I'm hoping to get onto a Ph.D course. I'd like to concentrate on Asian drama and try to bring Asian theatre to the world's attention. I don't know how successful I would be, but here's hoping.\n\nM: Oh, I'm sure you'll be successful. Now, Claire, what do you do for stage fright?\n\nW: Ah, stage fright! Well, many actors have that problem. I get stage fright every time I'm going to teach a new class. The night before, I usually can't sleep.\n\nM: What? For teaching?\n\nW: Yes. I get really bad stage fright. But the minute I step into the classroom or get onto the stage, it just all falls into place. Then I just feel like: Yeah, this is what I mean to do. And I'm fine.\n\nM: Wow, that's cool!\n\nQuestion: What does the woman say about her stage fright? \n\n- It keeps haunting her day and night.\n\n- Her teaching was somewhat affected by it.\n\n- It vanishes the moment she steps into her role.",

I can't seem to get anyone in the hospital to listen to my complaints and this outdated equipment is dangerous. Just look at it.\n\nM: Hmm, uh, are you trying to say that it presents a health hazard?\n\nW: Yes, I am. The head technician in the lab tried to persuade the hospital administration to replace it, but they are trying to cut costs.\n\nM: You are pregnant, aren't you?\n\nW: Yes, I am. I made an effort to get my supervisor to transfer me to another department, but he urged me not to complain too loudly. Because the administration is more likely to replace me than an X-ray equipment, I'm afraid to refuse to work. But I'm more afraid to expose my unborn child to the radiation.\n\nM: I see what you mean. Well, as your union representative, I have to warn you that it would take quite a while to force management to replace the old machines and attempt to get you transferred may or may not be successful.\n\nW: Oh, what am I supposed to do then?\n\nM: Workers have the legal right to refuse certain unsafe work assignments under two federal laws, the Occupation or Safety and Health Act and the National Labor Relations Act. But the requirements of either of the Acts may be difficult to meet.\n\nW: Do you think I have a good case?\n\nM: If you do lose your job, the union will fight to get it back for you along with back pay, your lost income.

Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity.

The levers were fitted to the side of the tank next to each other. If the light flashed on and off several times, the dolphins were supposed to press the left-hand lever followed by the right-hand one. If the light was kept steady, the dolphins were supposed to press the levers in reverse order. Whenever they responded correctly, they were rewarded with fish.\n\nM: Sounds terribly complicated.\n\nW: Well, that was the first stage. In the second stage, Doctor Bastian separated the dolphins into two tanks. They could still hear one another, but they couldn't actually see each other. The levers and light were set up in exactly the same way except that this time it was only Doris who could see the light indicating which lever to press first. But in order to get their fish, both dolphins had to press the levers in the correct order. This meant of course that Doris had to tell Bass whether it was a flashing light or whether it was a steady light.\n\nM: So did it work?\n\nW: Well, amazingly enough, the dolphins achieved a 100 % success rate.\n\nWhat was said before this conversation?",

Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory?\n\nW: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet.\n\nM: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease?\n\nW: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease.\n\nM: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot?\n\nW: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories.\n\nM: Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories?\n\nW: Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label. And I just picture that bottle to myself.\n\nQuestion: What are we told about people suffering from Alzheimer's disease? \n\n- They don't understand the mechanisms of memory.\n\n- They can't remember who they are.\n\n- They forget how to perform simple tasks.",

Uh, alright... You need to talk to the mechanic.\n\nCar Owner: The mechanic! So, who are you?\n\nMechanic: Well, I'm the assistant, and I've only been here on the job for two days.\n\nCar Owner: So, why didn't you tell me that in the first place? I mean, I wouldn't have wasted all this time!\n\nMechanic: You didn't ask.\n\nCar Owner: Okay, so how much is it going to cost?\n\nMechanic: Ah. Difficult to say. [That's what you said about the last thing!] Are you a local or from out of town?\n\nCar Owner: I'm just passing through, and this is the only place for miles. [Yeah, that's right.] Man, can't you see my license plate? [Sure did!]\n\nMechanic: Okay. The out-of-town rate. Let's see. Okay, here we go. If it's a fuel line, that'll be $100... No, no, That's the local rate. Here, $200 for the pre-screening check, $150 for parts, plus or minus $100, and $75 an hour for labor. Oh, oh yeah. Today's a holiday, so labor is actually $50 more per hour.\n\nCar Owner: Huh? Those prices are outrageous, and what holiday is it today?\n\nMechanic: Oh, it's the local pumpkin festival.\n\nCar Owner: Ah, come on. I can't believe this. Of all my luck, my car breaks down in an out-of-the-way town [That's right.], and it'll cost an arm and a leg to get my car fixed.\n\nMechanic: Ah, we'll take care of you. Just bring the car back on Tuesday so Mike, our mechanic, can take a look at it.\n\nCar Owner: Why not today? It's only 11:00...\n\nQuestion: Today, how much would labor be per hour for the car owner in this conversation? \n\n- $50\n\n- $75\n\n- $125",

But I was reading about plants that I didn't know, so I started to read as much as I could and get different writers' advice. I also used to visit Kew Gardens a lot. That was when we lived in Harrow, West London. I learned a lot from my visit. By the way, Dorset is one of England's three most beautiful towns, the other two being Wiltshire and Somerset. You must know what. I'm often invited to give talks to biology students in college.\n\nM: Yes, certainly. That's why I came here. Now what was your first garden like?\n\nW: It was a very tiny piece of land, which came with my house in Harrow, West London.\n\nM: Do you grow many plants yourself?\n\nW: I don't grow many plants from seeds.

Even worse, I got divorced when I had small children.\n\nM: Have you thought of the effect divorce may have on your children? Their needs can be forgotten as parents are struggling to re-establish their lives.\n\nW: Of course, we have. We are definitely more aware of the impact on children. After all we are not famous people who trade spouses like shoes. For most of us divorce is not entered into lightly. We all suffer. Anyway, we try to comfort our children.\n\nM: How?\n\nW: We tell them we love them and will always do.\n\nM: You haven't thought of saving the marriage?\n\nW: Yes, we have. We would do anything to spare our children pain. But you know, fixing a marriage is not like changing a tire. Family conflicts may take hold like a cancer.\n\nM: Then divorce is the only way to get rid of it.\n\nW: It's true with me. Others may succeed in fixing.\n\nM: Yet most people believe a had marriage is better for children than a divorce. According to a recent poll, more people today think parents should stay together for the sake of the children What do you think?\n\nW: I think the cost of staying together is worse than the benefits. Parents quarrelling and fighting all day may do more harm to their children.\n\nM: What do you want society to do for you?\n\nW: Understand us, not curse us. More importantly, they should help us share the loss and build a better future.\n\nQuestion: What does the woman think of fixing a marriage? \n\n- Every means should be tried before some marriages are fixed.\n\n- Some marriages can never be fixed.\n\n- A fixed marriage is not easily broken any more.",

            "M: Today on mind matters, I'm talking to Dr Ann Winters, an expert on human memory.. Ann, welcome to the program. Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory?\n\nW: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet.\n\nM: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease?\n\nW: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease.\n\nM: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot?\n\nW: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories.\n\nM: Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories?\n\nW: Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label. And I just picture that bottle to myself."

The highest production level was reached in 1990 with a total of 293 million bottles. Of course since those boom years sales have fallen.\n\nW: Has the market been badly hit by the recession?\n\nM: Oh certainly, the economic problems in champagnes' export markets that's Europe, the United States, Japan, and of course the domestic market in France, the economic problems have certainly been one reason for the decrease in champagne sales.\n\nW: And the other reasons?\n\nM: Another important factor has been price. In the early 90s, champagne was very overpriced, so many people stop buying it. Instead they bought sparkling wines from other countries, in particular from Australia and Spain. And then there was another problem for champagne in the early 90s.\n\nW: What was that?\n\nM: There was a lot of rather bad champagne on the market. This meant the popularity of good sparkling wines increased even more. People was surprised by their quality and of course they were a lot cheaper than champagne.\n\nW: Do you think the champagne market will recover in the future?\n\nM: Oh, I'm sure it will.

So I sat down and thought about what I'd really like to do.\n\nInterviewer: And that, I suppose, turned out to be something in the country?\n\nRoger: No, initially I didn't think of moving, but just of getting a different kind of job, you know social work with kids or old people, that kind of tiring.\n\nInterviewer: So what happened, why didn't you?\n\nRoger: Well, I hadn't got any of the right qualifications, and it would have taken me two years to get qualified and I certainly didn't want to go back to formal education again.\n\nInterviewer: Couldn't you have learned while on the job sort of picked it up as you went along?\n\nRoger: No, you have to have a diploma. Anyway, after talking it over with friends who had moved out I thought I'd like to give it a try--after all, a change of scene...\n\nInterviewer: Is better than.., yes, we all know that. So, where did you go when you did decide to move?\n\nRoger: I went right out to Shropshire. After all I thought if you're going to go rural you might as well do it properly. The first problem though was how I was going to make a living. There are fewer jobs in the country, so I decided to start up on my own.\n\nInterviewer: That's pretty ambitious, a townie moving off to the depths of the country and setting up his own business. How did you start, had you got any skills?\n\nRoger: I'd always had a garden and grown some vegetables and flowers, you know, usual things, salad stuff, carrots, peas, beans, a bit of fruit, some roses.., so I thought of a small holding, a kind of small farm. But when I looked at the prices to buy, I changed my mind; I didn't...\n\nQuestion: What is true of the man? \n\n- He moved to another country.\n\n- He didn't buy a small holding.\n\n- He studied for a social diploma for two years.",

Instead, Harrogate has become a popular town for people to retire to. Its clean air, attractive parks, and the absence of any industry, make this an ideal spot for people looking for a quiet life. Now, to tell us more about Harrogate, I have with me Tom Percival, President of the Chamber of Commerce.

The area is called the Stray.\n\nW: Why the Stray?\n\nM: It's called that because in the old days, people let their cattle stray on the area, which was common land.\n\nW: Oh, I see.\n\nM: Then, we've changes in farming and in land ownership. The Stray became part of the land owned by Harrogate.\n\nW: And is it protected?\n\nM: Oh, yes, indeed. As a special law, no one can build anything on the stray. It's protected forever.\n\nW: So it will always be park land?\n\nM: That's right. As you can see, some of the Stray is used for sports fields.\n\nW: I believe it looks lovely in the spring.\n\nM: Yes, it does. There're spring flowers on the old trees, and people visit the town just to see the flowers.\n\nQuestion: What attracts people most in the Stray during the spring time? \n\n- The beautiful flowers.\n\n- The refreshing air.\n\n- The mineral waters.",

And though it's hard to say how much they influenced me, I liked them, I respected them and I'm sure I was influenced to some degree by them.\n\nW: You were educated in the public schools?\n\nM: We moved almost every year, so I went to a different public school each year.\n\nW: So you would have been in high school and what years... approximately?\n\nM: Oh, I was in high school when... 26 or 27? I forgot. I graduated from high school in 32.\n\nW: What did you study in university?\n\nM: Well, that's a difficult question. I started out thinking I'd be an economist, and then I got disappointed with that. And after an odd experience in my junior year, I decided that I'd go out and study agriculture or management, but I enrolled in both for a whole year and tried to learn the required courses. I lasted a year, and then I came back to the main campus and finished up as an economics major specializing in labor economics.\n\nW: Did you go right graduate school or join the army after you graduated from the university?\n\nM: Well, I went to Harvard as a graduate student in philosophy in 1936, and stayed there until the war broke out. I was drafted after I took my PhD exams in the early part of 1941. So I went into the army before Pearl Harbor.\n\nQuestion: When did Mr. Hudson join the army? \n\n- At the time of Pearl Harbor.\n\n- Before his PhD exams.\n\n- In 1941.",

The ads also did not appear into key magazines. As a result, the campaign failed. Do you accept that summary of what happened?\n\nM: Well, the delay wasn't entirely our fault. You did in fact make late changes to the specifications of the advertisements.\n\nW: Uh, actually, you were late with the initial proposals so you have very little time and in fact, we only asked for small changes.\n\nM: Well whatever, can we repeat our offer to run the campaign for 4 extra weeks?\n\nW: That's not really the point.

If you are suffering from anxiety or depression, poetry may be the solution to your problems. Dr Stewart, how does poetry help?\n\nM: Em, OK! Look, let me give you an example. A patient came into our clinic last month. He was a middle-aged businessmen, and he was feeling, well, like most middle-aged businessmen, really stressed and with his life out of control. He talked to me about it, and, well, I was convinced that medication just wouldn't help him. Then I read him a poem called Leisure by WHDavis. Do you know the one? It begins, er...\n\nW: I do, yes.\n\nM: What is this life, er, so full of. It is so or if...\n\nW: I think it's if.\n\nM: If full of care, that's it, yes. We have no time to stand and stare. Well, you know the one. The next time he came to see me, he told me that, well, it was a sort of turning point for him. The poem made him think about the quality of his life and the need to find a balance between his work and his social life. Er, you see, because the idea was expressed poetically, he felt that he could identify with it, and actually feel the message in a way that he wouldn't if he simply discussed it with me. And we just had the usual kind of conversation about it.\n\nW: Yes, I see.\n\nM: You see, reading poetry to patients seems to make them calmer. Encouraging them to write it has an even more dramatic effect, actually. Era, there.., there are something about the process of expressing confused thoughts and feelings and emotions in writing that actually helps people or suffering from stress and anxiety. This happens especially if the words are written in a poetical way with a sense of rhythm rather than in prose, you see. Er, now, for a long time, we've been asking patients to write diaries to put their feelings into words. But it turns out that writing poetry seems to work much better for many patients.\n\nW: Right, and have you found that other doctors and therapists have made the same...\n\nQuestion: Which seems to be most effective for many patients, according to Dr Stewart? \n\n- Listening to poetry.\n\n- Reading poetry\n\n- Writing poetry.",

Don't most of the Chinese people live in China-town?\n\nM: Well, no, they live all over the city, but China-town is definitely the center of Chinese culture here. That's where you'll find the best Chinese restaurants, bookstores, art, theaters, things like that.\n\nW: What about the Japanese? Doesn't San Francisco have a large Japanese population too?\n\nM: No, actually there are only about 12 000 Japanese people here, but we do have an area called \"Japan-town\" that has Japanese restaurants and bookstores.\n\nW: You seem to know a lot about this city.\n\nM: Well, most San Franciscans think their city is pretty special.

Well, the report basically look into the various beliefs that people hold about old age and tries to prove them.\n\nM: And what do you think your report can achieve?\n\nW: We hope that it will somehow help people to change their feelings about old age. The  problem is that far too many of us believe that most old people are poor, lonely, and unhappy. As a result, we tend to find old people, as a group, unattractive. And this is very dangerous for our society.\n\nM: But surely we cannot escape the fact that many old people are lonely and many are sick.\n\nW: No, we can't. But we must also remember that the proportion of such people is no greater among the 60-70 age group than among the 50-60 age group.\n\nM: In other words, there is no more mental illness, for example, among the 60s-70s than among the 50s-60s.\n\nW: Right!\n\nM: Are people's mental abilities affected by old age?\n\nW: Certain changes do take place as we grow older, but this happens throughout life. These changes are very gradual and happen at different times with different people, but, in general, if you know a person well in his middle age and have seen how he deals with events and problems, you will easily recognize him in an old age.\n\nM: So that someone who enjoys new experiences, travel, education, and so on in his middle years will usually continue to do so into old age?\n\nW: Exactly.\n\nQuestion: What do we know about the changes that happen on old people? \n\n- People do not change in old age a lot more than in middle age.\n\n- It's hard to recognize a person when he is turning old.\n\n- Old people can't deal with events and problems properly.",

Sometimes people come to you with things they are worried about and they can be quite small things. They can be a story about corruption in local government, something they cannot quite understand, why it doesn't seem to be working out properly, like they are not having their litter collected properly or the dustbins emptied.\n\nW: How do you know that you've got a really successful program?

How does it compare with Britain?\n\nM: Well, it's definitely higher than over here, but salaries are substantially higher, so we'd certainly be better off than we are now.\n\nF: And what about accommodation?\n\nM: Well, actually, flats are much cheaper to rent in towns like Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg than they are here in London, so we'd be able to afford to live in a nice, spacious flat, I'd think.\n\nF: Mmm, that'd be nice!

They can be a story about corruption in local government, something they cannot quite understand, why it doesn't seem to be working out properly, like they are not having their litter collected properly or the dustbins emptied.\n\nW: How do you know that you've got a really successful program? One that is just right for the time?\n\nM: I think you get a sense about it after working in it in a number of years. You know which stories are going to get the attention. They are going to be published just the point when the public are concerned about that."

A year-long study of heart attack victims done at the Oakhurst Health Research Institute in California found that of those patients who spent half an hour a day watching comedy videos, 10 percent had a second heart attack, whereas 30 percent of those who did not watch had a second attack.\n\nW: Wow! Laughter is really a good medicine to patients. Can you give us another example?\n\nM: Sure! Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, learned this during a battle with an illness. He discovered that his condition improved when he enjoyed himself and watched funny movies.\n\nW: You said Norman learned this? Do we have to learn to laugh?\n\nM: Not necessarily. Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program.\n\nW: Oh. Do you have such a program to offer to the general public?\n\nM: Yes, we do. It's called the Smile Time-Out. You take a deep breath, smile, exhale, and say \"Aaah\" while visualizing all your muscles and cells smiling. Then add to that a memory of a time you felt really good and laughed and laughed.\n\nW: What about the situation in which you aren't in a mood to laugh?\n\nM: Even when you fake a smile or laugh, you get the same physiological benefits as when it's the real thing, because your mind is smart, but your body is stupid and can't tell the difference!\n\nQuestion: What can we learn about smile or laugh according to Dr. Berk? \n\n- Even a fake one can benefit people physiologically just as well as a real one.\n\n- You can't fool your body by pretending to be happy.\n\n- A smart mind can't tell the difference between a fake one and a real one.",

What happened?\n\nHenry: Well, I had some of the guys over Friday night to watch a basketball game on TV, but one of them got all excited, and started horsing around, waving his arms, and he accidentally knocked over my wife's 250-year old Chinese porcelain vase given to her [Oh no!], given to her by her grandmother, and broke it beyond repair.\n\nSam: Man, have you tried ...\n\nHenry: ... super glue? Yeap, but she would be able to tell in a second I was trying to pull something over her eyes.\n\nSam: Oh, wow. You're in hot water now.\n\nHenry: If it had only been that.\n\nSam: Oh, there's more?\n\nHenry: Yeah, you see, the water from the vase spilled all over the manuscript of a book my wife has been writing for the past two years. It blurred the ink over many of the pages. [Oh no.] And so one of the guys had the bright idea of drying the pages by the fire while we watched, uh, the rest game, but a spark from the fire must have blown out and burned the manuscript to a crisp.\n\nSam: But what about an electronic file copy? Had one, didn't she?\n\nHenry: Well, actually, her computer crashed the day before while I was playing some computer games, and I haven't been able to get it to work since.\n\nSam: Man, are you in trouble now. [I know.] You're going to have a hard time digging yourself out of this one. [Yeah.] Ah, so I get it now. You're buying the flowers for her as a part of some kind of peace offering, right?\n\nHenry: No, not at all. They're for my funeral.\n\nSam: [laughter]\n\nQuestion: From the tone of the conversation, what sort of reaction does Henry expect from his wife about his misfortunes? \n\n- disappointment\n\n- anger\n\n- contentment",

While I'm running I think about all sorts of things, and at the end of a run I'm sometimes surprised to find that I've managed to solve a problem that was on my mind.

What happened?\n\nHenry: Well, I had some of the guys over Friday night to watch a basketball game on TV, but one of them got all excited, and started horsing around, waving his arms, and he accidentally knocked over my wife's 250-year old Chinese porcelain vase given to her [Oh no!], given to her by her grandmother, and broke it beyond repair.\n\nSam: Man, have you tried ...\n\nHenry: ... super glue? Yeap, but she would be able to tell in a second I was trying to pull something over her eyes.\n\nSam: Oh, wow. You're in hot water now.\n\nHenry: If it had only been that.\n\nSam: Oh, there's more?\n\nHenry: Yeah, you see, the water from the vase spilled all over the manuscript of a book my wife has been writing for the past two years. It blurred the ink over many of the pages. [Oh no.] And so one of the guys had the bright idea of drying the pages by the fire while we watched, uh, the rest game, but a spark from the fire must have blown out and burned the manuscript to a crisp.\n\nSam: But what about an electronic file copy? Had one, didn't she?\n\nHenry: Well, actually, her computer crashed the day before while I was playing some computer games, and I haven't been able to get it to work since.\n\nSam: Man, are you in trouble now. [I know.] You're going to have a hard time digging yourself out of this one. [Yeah.] Ah, so I get it now.

But I was reading about plants that I didn't know, so I started to read as much as I could and get different writers' advice. I also used to visit Kew Gardens a lot.

I want to buy some land and build a house for my son. It's time he get married, and he needs a house. I'm thinking of building one and giving it to him.\n\nW: Your son's fortunate. So you want my help buying the land and building the house.\n\nM: Yes, that's right. As soon as you've done what's necessary for buying the land, Jerry and I will see an architect.\n\nW: Have you found a plot yet?\n\nM: Jerry was in Edinburgh last Saturday and saw a plot he likes. My wife and I went there two days ago, and we liked it, too. I'd like you to make the necessary inquiries for me.\n\nW: I'd be pleased to do that. I shall have to write to the Local Authority and inquire whether it is allowed to build a house on your piece of land. You're not allowed to build a house without permission from the Planning Authority. And sometimes the Authority decides that a house must be built of stone, and not of brick, so that it doesn't spoil the surrounding village.\n\nQuestion: When did Mr. Tim go to see the plot chosen by his son? \n\n- Last Friday.\n\n- Last Saturday.\n\n- Two days ago.",

I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said \"Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?\" So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document.\n\nM: Each year, there is one divorce for every two marriages. And a substantial portion of those who have divorced remarry. Is the notion of the premarital contract simply for those who are entering second marriages, or is it also something for the people getting married for the first time?\n\nW: Premarital contracting is a communication process. I think all of us, whatever age we are, whatever financial status we have, we have things to talk about. And if we avoid doing that and wait until there are problems, it's almost too late.

        "Woman: Wow! Do we really need all this stuff? Let me see that receipt.\n\nMan: Hey, I only bought the essentials.\n\nWoman: Okay. Let's see. Dog food. Twenty-four dollars and seventy cents ($24.70)? We don't even have a dog!\n\nMan: Well, it WAS going to be a surprise, but look in the back of the truck.\n\nWoman: What?\n\nMan: Ah, ha, hah. Speechless. I knew you'd love him.\n\nWoman: That thing? That dog's as big as a horse. He probably eats like one, too.\n\nMan: Ah, but he's sure friendly. And someone was giving him away at the supermarket, and I... I... I couldn't let that poor thing pass another day without a loving home.\n\nWoman: Whatever. Where was I? Eighteen dollars and nineteen cents ($18.19) for twenty-four cans of tomato juice? You don't even like that stuff!\n\nMan: Ahhhh. Not yet. I've decided to change my eating habits.\n\nWoman: Right.\n\nMan: You'll see, you'll see.\n\nWoman: Okay. Let's see. Three eighty-four ($3.84) for a box of chocolate cookies and twelve fifty-six ($12.56) for a case of soft drinks. [Yeah!] Changing your eating habits, huh? Do you really think that cookies are some type of diet food?\n\nMan: Hey, I'll just eat a cookie or two every other hour. In fact, they're a great source of carbohydrates for energy. And, you see, the tomato juice and cookies kind of, you know, cancel each other out.\n\nWoman: Oh brother. I can't believe what I'm hearing. Let's see. Where was I? A carton of eggs, two fifty ($2.50) for a gallon of milk, three cans of tuna. Okay. [Yeah.] And finally two steaks for eight fourteen ($8.14). Now, something worth enjoying. I'll get the grill started.\n\nMan: Oh, we... w... well. The steaks are for Herbert.\n\nWoman: Herbert. Who's Herbert?\n\nMan: Uh, he's the dog. [No!] You see, the previous owner said that he's kind of... he's somewhat picky about what he eats, [No!], and the steaks might help him adjust [Absolutely not!].... no, no, no, and the steaks might help him adjust to his new home. Hey, what are you doing? Oh, no. Why did you throw the steaks out on the ground outside?\n\nWoman:...\n\nWhat was said before this conversation?",

Many countries have national health insurance. America doesn't.\n\nW: Why is that?\n\nM: Well, it's because of the American culture. Americans think private companies can do things better than the government. So we depend on private companies for insurance.\n\nW: But isn't that expensive?\n\nM: You're right. It is expensive. And many people criticize it. They say it is not fair to poor people. They say the health systems are better in other countries, especially in Europe.\n\nW: But what do you think?\n\nM: I have no idea. I just do my best to have good insurance. It's important."

It will make people's lives easier.\n\nW: OK! So tell me how this house will make my life easier?\n\nM: When you arrive at the front door, you won't need a key.

I don't know. It's kind of a strange situation. He was dating this girl ... you know Alex? He was dating her and then he ended up breaking up with her because she was using drugs, and ...\n\nMan: Oh, wow. Well, that was a good thing, right?\n\nWoman: Well, yeah, that was, but now she's really angry with him, and he's having all kinds of problems with her, like last week, she punched him in the face and in the groin at school.

So, what did he do about it?\n\nWoman: Well, um ... she told him that if he said anything to a teacher, to the principal or anyone, she would get her friends to beat him up after school.\n\nMan: Man. This sounds really bad. I mean, you often think of men becoming aggressive toward women, but I guess it can go the other way.\n\nWoman: Yeah, yeah. You don't really think of this, but it happens, so um ...\n\nMan: So, what are you going to do about it?\n\nWoman: Well, first, Brandon said that, um, he was just going to let it go, but you know, he didn't want to cause any more problems ...\n\nMan: Yeah, I can see that.\n\nWoman: Then he decided that if she was doing that to do that to him and get away with it, she'd just do it to the next guy, so he went to the principal and the school police officer and reported everything, and now they're going to press assault charges against her.\n\nMan: So, isn't he worried about what her friends are going to do to him?\n\nWoman: Yeah, but he thinks that the other people in her group were just going along with her. [ Yeah. ] You know, I don't know. We'll see. They're probably frightened of what she might do to them. You know, she'll probably get suspended and have to go to court, but I don't know.
