        "I have never been a stop-and-smell-the-roses type of person. For me, there\u2019s always something that has to be done. In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I\u2019m \u201calways busy.\u201d\nSeventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled.\nA mother\u2019s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn\u2019t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning.\nMy usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day.\nSo I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden.\nInside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son.\nBetter mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of \u2018laziness\u2019, became a treasured memory.\nQuestion: How does the author deal with problems that arise in her life\nOptions:\n\nA. She tells other people to deal with them.\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. She procrastinates.\n\nD. She immediately deals with them.\n\n===\nThe correct answer is",

        "SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Thursday pushed back against a North Korean state media report that U.S. President Donald Trump agreed during this week\u2019s Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un to gradually lift sanctions against Pyongyang, saying Trump had been very clear about the sequence of steps in the process.\nThe official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process.\nSpeaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises.\n\u201cWhen we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,\u201d Pompeo said.\nPresident Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, \u201cThere is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.\u201d But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements.\nPompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements.\nThe secretary of state and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo said they are united in support of the U.S.-North Korea agreement, and in agreement on the goal of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.\nAfter the summit,...\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nWhat will it take to end the Korean conflict?",

I started to consider things like, \u201cIs he really sorry?\u201d \u201cWill he do it again?\u201d \u201cShould I leave him?\u201d\nAnd gave myself reasons like \u201cHe didn't mean to!\u201d \u201cHe's been apologizing all day!\u201d \u201cHe was just playing!\u201d \u201cHe meant to have fun, He's sorry!\u201d\nYet countered it with one simple statement, \u201cYeah that's what all abused women say.\u201d\nIn the end, I felt the question that should determine whether or not I should leave is: \u201cIf I stop talking to him tomorrow and can never see him or speak to him again, will I be okay with that?\u201d and the answer was \u201cNo\u201d, so obviously I shouldn't leave him.\nHe is very well aware that I was considering leaving him, (I have a very strict 0 tolerance policy of abuse in my relationships, as I was abused terribly growing up,) and he still apologizes to this day, but he has certainly made it a point to never do that again.

        "Earlier this year my depression got very bad, very quickly. I\u2019d been having intrusive suicidal thoughts for a while. It was a combination of a bad medication regimen and lots of little stressors\u2014school, work, a car accident, you name it. I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn\u2019t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead).\nOne night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account.\nI don\u2019t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn\u2019t specific, but rather something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to handle this.\u201d\nWhatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he\u2019d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me.\nI was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms. Whoever called saved me, but in a way I saved my own life that day. What I thought was just another routine post about stress got me the help I so desperately needed. I know without it, I would have ended my own life that day. Funny how that works.\nQuestion: Where did the narrator post his feelings?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

        "I remember back in the late 1970\u2019s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right.\nBut despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price \u2026 always a good starting point.\nAnyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision.\nBut something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further.\nA couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he \u2018kindly\u2019 informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously.\nIt turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course.\nLess than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase.\nAs they say in the property business \u2018Location, Location, Location\u2019 is always an important factor in determining the value of a property.

Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment.\nThe disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a \u201creportable\u201d liability, Trump chose to list it \u201cin the interest of transparency.\u201d It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president\u2019s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn\u2019t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year.\nThe Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported.

        "The U.S. Supreme Court plunged into the politically messy issue of redrawing congressional and legislative districts Tuesday, in a case that could have profound implications for both major political parties for years to come.\nThe high court heard oral arguments in a case brought by Democratic voters in Wisconsin. They argued that a Republican redistricting plan for the state assembly was so overtly partisan that it violated constitutional protections of freedom of speech and equal protection under the law for Wisconsin voters.\nA lower federal court sided with the challengers last year and against Republican state officials in Wisconsin. Officials argued Tuesday that they had not violated any constitutional rights when they drew up new boundaries for state assembly districts. \"Our legislature followed traditional redistricting criteria, which is what they have been required to do and we think they followed that and that the justices will agree,\" Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel told reporters in front of the court following the oral arguments.\nThe process of state legislatures redrawing congressional and legislative district boundaries has been enmeshed in politics for two centuries. Early on, the process was referred to as \u201cgerrymandering,\u201d where one party or the other tries to gain an electoral advantage by redrawing district boundaries to maximize their voting clout.\nRepublicans have had success in several states in redrawing congressional and legislative voting districts and that has helped them maintain their majority in the House of Representatives. Democrats have come under fire as well for partisan maps in states where they control the legislature, like Maryland and Massachusetts.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments, the more liberal high court justices seemed open to the case brought by Democratic voters.

They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country.\nIn New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president.\n\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally.\nIn Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration.

In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance.\nFor Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication.\nThough floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated\u2014the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented\u2014this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly \u201cscattered\u201d floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, \u201cThe tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific.

        "Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.\nContext: I am currently waiting for peer reviews of two books I\u2019ve worked on: one sole-authored, one co-authored. We don\u2019t talk much about the experience of waiting for reviews, and it\u2019s not something that appears to have been researched. Yet it\u2019s something everyone doing academic work has to go through and it may be bad for our mental health.\nI\u2019m finding it particularly difficult at the moment because a lot rides on these reviews. The sole-authored book, which is on a contentious topic, has already had one set of reviews. Reviewer 1 was utterly damning, saying \u201cI couldn\u2019t find anything to praise\u201d. Luckily, Reviewers 2 and 3 were more measured, offering both praise and constructive criticism, and their input helped me to revise and strengthen the typescript. However, in the process, my editor and I realised that we needed further reviews from people with a particular kind of specialist knowledge. My editor approached around ten potential reviewers, but only one agreed to do the job. So I\u2019m gibbering \u2013 what if that person agrees with Reviewer 1?\nThe co-authored book is in a contentious format. My co-authors and I decided that I would be the person to liaise with publishers, as I have form in this process. The last time I liaised with academic publishers for a co-authored book was in the early 2000s, and I\u2019d forgotten how heavily responsible it makes me feel. Fortunately, I\u2019ve found a publisher that is interested and has sent the book out for reviews, to two professional academics and two students. This is great \u2013 and terrifying \u2013 but at least there are four reviewers. Even so, what if they all think it\u2019s rubbish?\nIn many ways I love the peer review system. I welcome feedback on my writing, and I\u2019m not at all averse to constructive criticism. I am by no means arrogant enough to think I can write a good book without input from others. Yet peer review, as a process, is fraught with uncertainty. Comments may not be constructive, or may not come at all. They may be positive, or negative, or in between, or a mixture.\nQuestion: Who did the author and their co-authors decide that they should liaise with?\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. editors\n\nC. reviewers\n\nD. publishers",

        "If you visited the Getty Center in July or early August, you may have encountered a group of high school students wearing white lab coats with \u201cTeen Lab\u201d splattered across the back. You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney\u2019s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes.\nThe teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018.\nThe Getty\u2019s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning?\nTo address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2)\nThe Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems.\nQuestion: After the story the museum probably what?\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. Cancelled the program.\n\nC. Continued the programs.\n\nD. Spent the grant money elsewhere.\n\n===\nThe correct answer is",

As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.)\nQuestion: When did the SPRINT study get published?\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. 2015\n\nC. 2014\n\nD. 2017",

And he doesn't know to this day. A pity, because thanks to that person he reached his current status and number 67 on the list of the wealthiest Poles.\nBack then, during that beautiful, rusty white Christmas Eve night, Przekosniak, who was rudely kicked out from a social network for utopian fanatics of extreme phobias (www.ilovefobia.pl) just a few days earlier, got an idea.\nIt was a quite good idea too, and the next SMS (\"All at cart by unintentionally only honest lamb\") convinced him it was the best idea of his life.\nSlawek Przekosniak, together with a friend from ilovefobia.pl - Czesiek Ciag, decided to set up an on-line service, through which one could send SMS greetings to mobile phones. And the most important feature of the service was that texts of the wishes were not going to be predetermined and there would be no set list of pre-selected options. Messages would be created by a special software program from random words provided by a customer. Such a system would allow for truly unique greetings, and after all, nobody said they had to be comprehensible.\nCzesiek took care of the development of the software, which for now they named \"John of the Disc\". Czesiek had suitable experience in the matter. While on the forum for (select as appropriate) phobics he designed an application, which created slogans for street protests. The application, even though it produced phrases completely illogical and nonsensical, became quite popular, and some of its most unique catchphrases you could have seen on TV - \"Out With There Harm Out!\" or \"To Them Bag Away Now Now!\"\nTwo future men of success got to work and the SMS greeting portal bestbestbest.pl went live just before Easter.\nWho made the phrase \"To Them Bag Away Now Now!\"?\n- Czesiek Ciag\n- Slawek\n- TV\n- not enough information",

Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways.\nMy husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him.\nI was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable.\nMy husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex \u2014 not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy.\nI often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.  At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he\u2019d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would \u201ccure\u201d him.\nFeeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken.

        "When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. \u201cIt is the key to self improvement!\u201d, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don\u2019t quite practice what they preach.\nSeeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult.\nHere\u2019s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage.\nIn my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let\u2019s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don\u2019t share the same confidence.\nAn understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: \u201cI might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better\u201d. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What is probably true about the author?\nOptions:\n- the author probably has experienced failures at work and tried to improve\n- the author fails and gives up at work\n- not enough information\n- the author never fails at work",

Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment.\nThe disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a \u201creportable\u201d liability, Trump chose to list it \u201cin the interest of transparency.\u201d It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president\u2019s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn\u2019t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year.\nThe Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met \u201cthe disclosure requirements for a reportable liability\u201d under the Ethics in Government Act.\nUnder the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of $10,000 during the previous reporting period. \u201cKnowingly or willfully\u201d falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report.\nCritics seized on...\nWhat did the Ethics Committee think of Trumps monetary reports?\n\nA. they thought they were sufficient\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. they didn't care\n\nD. they thought he left items out",

Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm.\nDuring the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die.\nAs the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power.\nAt the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames.\n\"Form around them,\" called the leader of Roland's party.\nRoland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to.

As far as most of my relationships went, mine with Julie was great. But it was great in all the wrong places. There really wasn't much more to it than sex. Even though it was a mind-numbing, bathe-in-gasoline-to-slough-the-shame-from-my-soul kind of sex, it didn't matter. At the end of the day we were just objects to each other. We couldn't talk about anything else. We'd tried before, but it had usually led to an afternoon of power-fucking in every changing room on Rodeo Drive. It was a fun ride, but nothing more. And like every great ride, Julie was beautiful, fast, and could turn on a dime in the blink of an eye.\n\"I don't understand, Dingo.\" I couldn't tell if it was the 12 stitches over my eye giving me the headache or Julie's prattling.

        "The Getty Villa is a museum unlike any in the world. It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context.\nSince 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects\u2019 subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context.\nReenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture.\nStarting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor\u2019s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor\u2019s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean.\nQuestion: After the story the writer probably:\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

Let me explain before I get called irresponsible, or incapable of having a dog, or incompetent, My dog is my baby, since the day I got her we've been inseparable. I learned from this mistake and have taken every precaution to prevent it from happening again. She was uninjured luckily, but I was freaking traumatized. I have a SUUUUPPPPEEEERRR long driveway, so I usually drive my truck to the end to check my mail, and on this particular day, I was out in my yard playing with Roxie, I saw the mailman drive by through my fence, and so we walked back to the house, I grabbed my keys, and off we went. This wasn't too long ago, maybe May, so it's hot, typical North Carolina weather, maybe 92 and some change, so my windows are down, because I drive a 13 year old black truck, so it's hot as hell, and it makes it hard to breathe. The AC works, it just takes time to kick in, and number 5 (my highest AC setting) does not work. As I'm driving down, I'm going maybe 5 miles an hour. I'm petting Roxie with my right hand when I feel her jerk out of my reach and I hear a bush rustle, I look to the passenger side, slam on brakes (because the last thing I want is to hurt my baby) and put the truck in park.

By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn\u2019t like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to). Here I am nervously sweet talking to them, my voice trembling saying good boys. My grandma is her despair grabs the GS\u2019s neck, and his hair bristled and growled for a second before turning back to our pup.

Either you have it and the obligation and responsibility becomes a burden (so I\u2019ve been told, ha) or you don\u2019t have it and life without money becomes a burden. I guess money became a burden to me when I started paying my own bills.\nLet me explain. I raised my 2 girls by myself. I was fortunate to have a good job as an office manager for a doctor in Dallas.

When I didn\u2019t have money for something they wanted I felt like I carried the world on my shoulders. I didn\u2019t let them know how stressful it all was because I felt like it was none of their business. They were kids and needed to be kids. They would soon enough be feeling the stress of managing their own household and shouldn\u2019t be asked to help shoulder that burden as kids.\nOnce, me and my youngest daughter, who was an adult at this time, went to a drive in fast food place and got a couple of drinks. My daughter was treating me and when the car hop came to deliver the drinks, my daughter gave her $5.00 as a tip, which was more than the drinks! I, of course, asked why she did that and she told me that they live off their tips and she knew what that was like having been a waitress before. I said something about her needing the money as well and how money makes the world go around.

        "Read the following context and answer the question.\nContext: I was fencing wire at Flat Broke Acres and trying to tighten up the wire a bit. I lost the grip of the fencing wire and the pliers smacked me in the mouth.\nThis is what I hit myself in the mouth with. The curved end glance off my left front central incisor.\nIt hurt some, my lips were lacerated, I scared my wife when I came in to take a look at it in the mirror but the pain to come was far worse. Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head.\nTooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain.\nProblem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more.\nI chalked it up to it being a karmic reminder about patients and dental pain as I\u2019ve never had a cavity let alone a dental abscess. It let me feel your pain.\nQuestion: Who did he scare?\nAnswer:",

        "The leading U.S. presidential hopefuls reacted strongly Monday to the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.\nSunday's incident that left 49 people dead and 53 others wounded was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen and the son of Afghan parents.\nIn her first speech since the shooting, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told supporters in Cleveland, \"The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive.\"\nClinton laid out a multi-faceted approach to combating terrorism. The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe.\nIn an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \"radical\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\"\nDoing so, she said, \"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh.\nClinton called for citizens to reach out to Muslims in the United States \"to help us defeat this threat.\" She cited the need for \"common sense reform\" of gun ownership laws, including a ban on assault weapons.\nAfter Obama did not use the term \"radical\" in his remarks Sunday from the White House, Trump criticized Obama's approach to extremism and said the president \"should step down.\"\nTrump, meanwhile, renewed a call for a ban on the entry of Muslim immigrants into the United States.\n\"The only reason the killer was in America in the first place was we allowed his family to come here,\" Trump said in a speech to supporters in Manchester, New...\nwhy does trump probably dislike Obama\n\nA. because he is a bad leader\n\nB. because he is black\n\nC. because he is jealous of him\n\nD. not enough information",

        "The collaborative process between me and Claire Bridge has been good so far. Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows:\nHow would you define creativity?\nWhat does it mean to you to be an artist?\nDo you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy?\nChange and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography.\nYou seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like \u201cDark Matter\u201d, \u201cTouching Infinity\u201d, \u201cWe are made of Stars\u201d, \u201cRising tides\u201d and \u201cA drop in the ocean\u201d or \u201cAlchemy\u201d. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences?\nWhat continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist?\nWe both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire\u2019s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire\u2019s practice. After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September. Hopefully if all goes well we will both have an artist portrait that lives up to our expectations.\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nHow long will each of Claire's answers be edited down to?",

        "I lost sight in one eye when in college, I had two preschool children at the time. I was walking through the house one morning and suddenly I could see NOTHING out of one eye. When I told my husband,who was right there when it happened, he assumed my eye was just blurry or something had gotten in the eye. He took me to the ophthalmologist who verified that I could not see out of the eye. Then we subsequently got the worse news that it was a neurological condition with a long name I do not remember that there was nothing he could do about. He said that I would either get my sight back or I you and all we could do was wait and see if it came back. This was right before finals that semester but he told me I absolutely could not be studying or using my good eye for reading or basically anything that would strain it or I could end up losing sight in that eye also. Needless to say, as a mom of two children ages 2 1/2 and 6 months,I could not afford to lose ALL of my sight! So, I had to wait. I could not drive like that either which made matters worse. Both my husband and I were in school fulltime (until then), fortunately it was the end of the semester, unfortunately it was BEFORE finals. My sight did come back but not for about 5 months. When it first started to come back I still couldn't drive because although I could see I did not have my peripheral vision, that did not fully come back for quite a while. I cannot imagine it a person who goes totally blind goes through, I just know for me it was not an easy to to go through.\nWhen did the author go to the ophthalmologist?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- After she realized that she couldn't drive because she didn't have peripheral vision.\n- After 5 months when she recovered her sight.\n- not enough information\n- Right after she lost sight in one eye to see what the problem was.",

        "I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage:\nThe severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots.\nThe very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin.\nIn order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment.\nAfter cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that\u2019s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.\n\nAfter gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them.\nQuestion: What is probably true of the writer of the story?\nOptions:\n\nA. the writer probably avoids facial cleanser\n\nB. the writer probably uses facial cleansers\n\nC. not enough information\n\nD. the writer probably stops using facial cleanser\n\n===\nThe correct answer is",

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones.\nI had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20\u2019s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium.\nThe counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints.\nThere was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, \u201c He will die before morning. \u201c\nI suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless. I recall being plagued by this young man\u2019s face for some time when I tried to go to sleep at night.\nBruce Kugler\nQuestion: how long did it take to restrain the patient?\nAnswer:",

        "That fall came and I went back to Michigan and the school year went by and summer came and I never really thought about it. I'm not even sure if I was officially asked, I just wound up heading back to New Jersey when school was out. I think my parents thought it was a good enough deal. They were already having some problems and without Nonna there anymore to take care of me I think my cousin's house on the coast seemed like as good a spot as any to stick me for the summer. It certainly wasn't because of any great love between me and my cousin. We weren't really very good friends at that point.

I could tell the desk manager wanted to hassle me, but he was too busy arguing with a middle-aged peroxide-blonde woman in a leopard-print top.

I knocked anyways, but there was no answer. Pushing the door open just enough to poke my head in, I called, \"Hello? Is anybody in there?\"\nThere was no response, so I went in and felt along the wall for the light switch. A single weak bulb came on, lighting up the tiny, sparse room with a dim yellow glow. The room was about 8 feet by 8 feet, and the only furniture was a dingy, unmade bed and a metal foot locker. There were no windows, no closet, and no bathroom. As I stepped all the way in, I noticed a wooden baseball bat propped up beside the door.\nMy watch said 6:20 - twenty minutes late for the interview. I sat on the edge of the bed to wait, hoping that maybe my contact had just stepped out momentarily.\nAfter a few minutes, a phone started ringing out in the hallway. I let it ring six times with no one answering before I decided to get it - partly in the off chance it was my contact, but mostly out of morbid curiosity as to what kind of business someone would have calling this dump.\nQuestion: What happened before he went to the room 313?\nAnswer:",

He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School.\nKaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States \u2013 a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters.\nAt Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools.

        "Have you ever wondered whether it\u2019s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising?\nIn 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of \u201csuccessful aging\u201d health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.)\nDuring the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)?\nThat\u2019s right. When it came to avoiding \u201cmajor mobility disability\u201d \u2014 which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more \u2014 a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education.\nSpecifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program.\nThis is a very encouraging finding! That said, it\u2019s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more.\nIn this post, I\u2019ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.\nWant to know how often the exercisers experienced \u201cadverse events\u201d?

At the end of this post, I\u2019ll share my list of key take-home points for older adults and family caregivers.\nWho were the study volunteers?

        "Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.\nContext: The parking lot for the Center for Addictions Treatment was in the back of the building, as was the front door. The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen.\nThere was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating.\nThe telephone rang before Ray was even half-finished with his cigarette.\n\"Admit it now, Ray.\" She sounded petulant.\n\"Fine, I admit it. Do I get the booby prize?\"\n\"That depends on whether you intended a double entendre or not.\"\n\"Of course I did.\"\n\"Then you lose. Get your mind out of the gutter.\"\nHe took a drag on his cigarette, then made himself sound insulted. \"I'm not the one sitting around naked and calling strange men in the middle of the night.\"\nQuestion: After the end of the story, what does Ray do\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- Hang up the phone and finish the cigarette\n- Answer the phone\n- Give a fire drill",

        "As it turned out, Greg would have had a hard time canceling the check, even if he'd changed his mind. Chloe's crew had already sprung into action as soon as they left the building. The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that.\nPaul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees. From his point of view, there was no reason for Greg to do that.\nOf course, it was still a huge risk for Chloe and Paul. If Greg just wanted a delay to get the lawyers involved, then they were in trouble. Chloe and he had broken a fist full of laws in the past twelve hours. They needed to cash that check and disappear as soon as they could.\nThe bank put up a bit of a fuss about the check, which was one more reason Paul hated Bank of Fucking America. They always had some rule to screw a customer. But Chloe made a bunch of noise and actually jumped up and down at one point and eventually they walked out of the bank with a cashier's check.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What happened after Chloe's team left the bulding?\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB.

        "When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. \u201cIt is the key to self improvement!\u201d, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don\u2019t quite practice what they preach.\nSeeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult.\nHere\u2019s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage.\nIn my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let\u2019s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don\u2019t share the same confidence.\nAn understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: \u201cI might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better\u201d. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nHow much do those who are insecure about their work probably believe they should communicate their failures to others?",

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products!\nOkoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven.\nWhen you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made.\nThe first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons.

He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976.\nKelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012.\nAs the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America.\nKelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \"tens of thousands of people,\" including unaccompanied children, \"to our nation's doorstep.\"\nHe also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs.\nIn 2010, Kelly became the highest ranking U.S. military officer to lose a child in combat operations in Southwest Asia.

        "Emily Nagoski is a badass Ph.D. who teaches human sexuality. She wrote a book \u2013 Come As You Are. Here\u2019s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can\u2019t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book.\nIn this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress \u2014 a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women\u2019s sex lives.\nTHE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES\nThis concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don\u2019t often press them at the same time \u2013 in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver\u2019s ed \u2013 but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go?\nThat\u2019s right, you STOP!\nOk, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another.\nIf your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time.\nThis isn\u2019t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nDr. Nagoski thinks that:",

The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui.\nMonday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.\nPresident Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \"very good\" about Tuesday's summit.\nAhead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into \u201cunknown territory\u201d for the meeting Tuesday.\nIn response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said \u201cI really feel confident\u201d about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world\u2019s most reclusive countries for three generations.\nTrump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, \u201cwants to do something great for his people.\u201d But Trump cautioned that Kim \u201cwon\u2019t have that opportunity again\u201d if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a \u201cone-time shot.\u201d\nTrump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles.

        "\u201cTeachers like to agree with each other, when we talk about learning. It\u2019s hard to change that, when the model we have wanted to make work has nonetheless been failing for 40 years.\u201d Professor Brian Boyd\nNo area has remained up there in the contentiousness charts in Scotland as the notion of business and education working together to do something better for our young people.\nMost schools do not \u2018partner\u2019 with colleges or universities. Instead, they are production facilities for undergraduates and college entrants. Fewer are set up to systematically provide apprenticeship opportunities as well as learning. At NoTosh, we\u2019ve been working on a few, nascent projects to change the attitudes of schools from being these production facilities into something more of a life support - what metrics of success might we use if schools judged their success on the results of their alumni, five, ten or twenty years down the line, much like universities do?\nCity of Glasgow College have partnered with Newlands Junior College (NJC) to make the experience of a day in college more than what, in other circumstances, is too often perceived as a day off from school. The Junior College is called this, and not a school, for that very reason, to mark it out as a stepping stone between school and full-blown college. NoTosh helped last August to provoke the team around their thoughts of what 'unschool' might look like.\nThe College was backed and founded by Jim McColl, one of Scotland\u2019s top business people.\nIn the future, suggests, McColl, might be be possible to take funding of learning out of its pre-existing silos, particularly for this group of students, about 60 in every city at these ages, who just need a different approach to the traditional comprehensive approach? A crossover funding model that helps learning happen in both \u2018school\u2019 or Junior College and college or university might be interesting.

        "My old roommate\u2019s cats, Clise and Monkey, were about as different as cats could be. Clise, rescued as an emaciated kitten from a local park, grew up to be morbidly obese. His interests mainly involved eating food, begging for food, or going around the neighborhood scrounging for food. He could hear a can opener from a mile away.\nMonkey was a more active cat. He liked to chase the laser pointer and was the first to run to the door when someone arrived. But he could also be lazy, lounging in a sunbeam or stretched out on the couch.\nBoth of them liked to watch TV.\nSoon after I moved in, I started having health issues which necessitated a lot of time lounging around myself. This was the era of reality TV, back when much of it was actually good. The cats, Monkey especially, watched with me.\nMonkey definitely had his preferences. His favorite shows were The Girls Next Door and Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making The Team. Notice a theme here? Playboy Playmates and professional cheerleaders. Monkey liked his T & A (tits and ass).\nIf one of these shows was on, and I turned it to Project Runway or something, Monkey would march off. But as soon as I turned it back, and he could hear the high-pitched giggling, he\u2019d come running back.\nClise\u2019s favorite shows were Top Chef, Iron Chef, and Rachael Ray. Food porn. If there was something he especially craved, like a shrimp stir-fry, he\u2019d assume a begging pose, right in front of the TV, as if Rachael might take pity on him and throw him a scrap or two.\nI moved out about a year later.

Whatever the case, moving rarely comes at a convenient time and involves so many variables that it is difficult to exhale until all of the documents are signed.\nEven then, that point in the process instantaneously starts a whole new chapter in the book of moving.\nNo matter how long it takes to sell (or not sell) your previous home, whether you\u2019re able to find your dream kitchen or settle for less, if you\u2019re moving down the street, across the country, or around the world, the act of moving can be completely overwhelming.\nLong story short: Moving is a process.\nIn the midst of all the uncertainties, there are a few ways to stay organized while moving.

This should include any and all businesses you frequent or subscribe to, like pest control services, lawn maintenance, even all of your neighborhood loyal buyer programs you participate in.

Did you fall prey to their claims?\nRather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R.\nR was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories:\nShe wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \"miracle cure\" company who was along those lines! \"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts.\nShe received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham.\nAt which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\" Which is awesome.\nI still feel for her.

        "As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women\u2019s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher.\nMy PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) \u2013 a weighty force in UK academia \u2013 the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda.\nThere is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world.\nBefore embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study.

Now, let me pause here, when I say, \u201cmore work\u201d did not mean more of the existing work they already did. \u201cMore work\u201d did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired.\nMore work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I\u2019m a programmer. And \u201cmanagement\u201d decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I\u2019d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work.\nSo, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices:\nI do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6.\nOption 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It\u2019s not what you hired me for, and it\u2019s not what you pay me for.\nWhen my boss replied, \u201cOur company is not in the position to pay for two roles\u201d, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don\u2019t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages.\n1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles.\nTakeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms.

When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control.\nOn my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone\u2019s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again.\nOn another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes.\nHe was unpredictable and he didn\u2019t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow.\nEventually, the staff couldn\u2019t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief.\nLast year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn\u2019t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner?\nHe was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him. Most definitely the most unforgettable classmate.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What type of school did the author attend when he first met the \"vicious bully?\nOptions:\n\nA. A boarding school for badly behaved children.\n\nB. A boarding school for kids that parents couldn't cope with.\n\nC. not enough information\n\nD. A boarding school for mental challenged children.",

        "Since grade school we have known about the food pyramid, but the food pyramid I want to discuss today is quite different: The Mediterranean Food Pyramid.\nThe pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously.\nThe pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed.\nThe pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region.\nOne of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways.\nThey are among the minority of the world\u2019s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic.\nThere are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) \u2013 plus a little red wine.\nYour fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily.\nFish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals.\nFruit and vegetables (7 servings) should be consumed daily.\nWhat is the author's favorite fruits to eat on the Mediterranean Diet?\n- not enough information\n- Strawberries\n- Apples\n- Bananas",

        "Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of.\nThe key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality.\nDigging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn\u2019t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised.\nA paradigm shift? Not quite\nDoes this study turn on its head \u2018everything we knew about nutrition?\u2019 Not quite. And here\u2019s why.\nBefore the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day.\nHere is just one example \u2013 a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter.\nI\u2019m not going to pick apart the PURE study for its flaws. Such issues are consistent across all observational studies no matter if the conclusions support consensus views or not.

Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution.\n\n\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\" Diaz-Canel said.\nDiaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution.\nHe succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office.

        "I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways.\nMy husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him.\nI was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable.\nMy husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex \u2014 not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy.\nI often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.  At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he\u2019d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would \u201ccure\u201d him.\nFeeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved.  There was nothing wrong with me \u2014 I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused.\nWhat now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family.

Its name was Dogland. Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes.

        "A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words!\nHow does Patch get to his drey?\n- he scurries up the tree\n- his owner carries him\n- not enough information\n- he swings from branch to branch",

If Moore wins, Republicans will retain their 52-48 majority in the Senate, but a Jones victory would pare the margin to 51-49, possibly further complicating Trump's efforts to pass his legislative agenda.\nPre-election polls at various times have shown both Moore, 70, and Jones, 63, in the lead, but the history of elections in deeply conservative Alabama runs against Jones.\nNo Democrat has won a Senate election in the state since Richard Shelby did in 1992, and two years later he switched parties to become a Republican. Still a senator, Shelby said Sunday that he voted absentee for \"a distinguished Republican\" as a write-in choice, but could not bring himself to vote for Moore after one woman, now in her 50s, said Moore abused her when she was 14.\nMoore, twice deposed as a state Supreme Court justice for failing to follow federal court rulings, has accused journalists, Democrats and establishment Republicans in Washington of trying to undermine his campaign.

Each nuclear test conducted at the site was progressively more powerful, with the first bomb detonated in 2006 producing an estimated 1-2 kiloton yield, much less powerful than the 16-kiloton bomb the United States used on Hiroshima during World War II, and the last test in 2017 producing close to a 250-kiloton yield.\nThere were reports that the last nuclear test in September of 2017 triggered a tunnel collapse rendering the site unusable, but analysts say there were still two other tunnels that could be used for future tests.\nEarlier this year North Korean leader Kim Jong Un...\nWhen did North Korea finish six nuclear tests?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA.

        "It was a good feast. Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf. Instantly the thoughts of the crumbling villa, the torn furniture, and the diminishing coffers fled from her mind. Euphoria flowed in. She felt it in her fingers and toes.\nImmediately after the end of this text, Celenda\n- is drunk\n- is sick\n- not enough information\n- is high",

A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn\u2019t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus).\nWe sat there for about 4\u20135 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip.\nShe was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation\u2014I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it\u2019s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used.\nAs the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations.\nQuestion: What kind of bus route is this?\nOptions:\n\nA. A tour bus that crosses national boundaries\n\nB. A greyhound bus that takes passengers from one city to another in different states\n\nC. not enough information\n\nD. A city bus that travels within Chicago or to very nearby areas",

I\u2019d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!).\nFast forward several (ahem\u2026) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there\u2019s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention \u2013 the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out \u2013 Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey.\nJuicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it\u2019s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses.\nShow Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it\u2019s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it\u2019s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What shades of Juicy Tubes look good on her?\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- natural\n- nude\n- a gentle orange",

No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands.\nIt was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary.\nPatch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day.\nEventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel.\n\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\" Patch shouted up.\n\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: At the end of this story, the bluejay is:\nOptions:\n\nA.

Or some other place if that's what she wanted. If things went as planned, there was no limit to what she could have. She smiled to herself as a crowd of sunburned, middle-aged men broke ranks to let her pass on her way toward Mallory Square. They had no idea who she was, but she liked to think that they could sense her strength and that it intimidated them. Not enough to stop them from staring openly at her chest of course, but what did she expect? They were still men.\nDuval Street, Key West's main tourist drag, buzzed with early evening activity. The sun had set less than an hour ago, and the throngs moving up from the nightly sunset ritual in Mallory Square now wandered about, trying to choose between the dozens of bars and restaurants vying for their attention. She moved against the general flow and seemed to know exactly where she was going. She knew these streets well and had planned out her route ahead of time.\nBut something bothered her. That nagging feeling in the back of her brain that she'd long ago learned to heed even though it was wrong as often as it was right. You couldn't survive in her world without learning to pay attention to such feelings, and she'd more than survived - she'd prospered beyond the dreams of any young hacker or con artist.

She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour. In any case, as he rounded the corner at the top of the hill, the road was apparently free of snow and ice and there was no reason to slowdown. Until the moose stepped out onto the road just ahead of them.\nQuestion: after the story ends, the character\nOptions:\n- stopped telling this story\n- believes it's the moose's fault he was born early\n- not enough information\n- believes he was born premature",

        "Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the \u2018worried well\u2019 is certainly alive and kicking.\nVitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices.\nContrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don\u2019t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables.\nWhile it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn\u2019t been well studied in large population groups.\nUsing data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn\u2019t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men.\nThe eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium.\nProving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium.\nFor someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement \u2018just in case\u2019 offers little to no benefit.\nWho took the supplements?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. research conductors\n\nC. research participants\n\nD. the author",

One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party\u2019s conservative and moderate wings.\nThe compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide $25 billion in funding for Trump\u2019s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.\nRepublicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation.\n\u201cWe can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,\u201d Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families.\nThe president\u2019s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,\u201d Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota.\nLater, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy:\n\u201cThe border is going to be just as tough as it\u2019s been\u201d despite...\nQuestion: Who defended his position at a political rally?\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB.

        "Both gross and tragic. The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That \u201c66\u201dindicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses.\nTheir injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries.\nAdditionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff.\nRecently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago. I believe people deserve a second chance, but of course this is a very controversial matter.\nQuestion: What kind of machine guns did the bank robbers use?\nOptions:\n- not enough information \n - AEK-999 \n - Kord Machine Gun \n - M249\n===\nThe correct answer is",

        "Ironically, J. Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty\u2019s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his \u201cranch\u201d on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him.\nFollowing a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms\u2014Galleries 105 to 108\u2014share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty\u2019s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place.\nFrom a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa\nGetty bought the 64-acre ranch\u2014once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant\u2014just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (\u201cTeddy\u201d) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection.\nHe knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty\u2019s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nHow many children did Getty have?",

        "One time I was walking my puppy (profile pic) who was then around 5 months, with my mum and grandma. By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn\u2019t like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to). Here I am nervously sweet talking to them, my voice trembling saying good boys. My grandma is her despair grabs the GS\u2019s neck, and his hair bristled and growled for a second before turning back to our pup. At this point my baby girl is sitting down with her tail tucked close, ears flattened, and head down. I thought \u201cDear Lord someone\u2019s losing a limb today.\u201d When suddenly this car comes pulling up and this man comes out with a leash, the owner. He practically had to wrestle the GS into the car. A woman in a pickup truck comes next trying to get the husky but he ran away again, but my mom didn\u2019t care, she scooped up our pup and ran, the leash trailing behind her, and even my grandma who has troubles in her knees speed walked. My mom would later laugh at me because I became so pale and because I tried to baby talk a dog to leave us alone.\nQuestion: What is probably true about the puppy?\nOptions:\n\nA.

An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served.\nBut his freedom came with a price, something that didn\u2019t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office.\n\u201cAt the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn\u2019t understand the consequences,\u201d Meade says.\nFourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can\u2019t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration.\nHome to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state\u2019s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6.\nHe\u2019s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they\u2019ve completed the terms of their sentence.\nThe measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to change the system,\u201d Meade says confidently. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we\u2019re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.\u201d\nQuestion: Desmond Meade probably believes that:\nOptions:\n- voters in Florida support all felons.\n- not enough information\n- felons should be able to vote while in prison.\n- voters in Florida will support his ballot initiative.",

        "Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: what is probably true about jimbob?\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. they adopted a monkey\n\nC. he was not really his parents child\n\nD. he was different",

        "I will never own a Chanel suit. It is unlikely that I will ever own a (genuine) Chanel handbag. However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes ($AU39), they are still much more affordable than the $AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one).\nAfter seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted.\nI argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly $80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a $10 voucher for my birthday and I got a $30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For $38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite.\nGraphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect. But ordinarily two would be sufficient.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: This customer is likely:\nOptions:\n\nA. A man\n\nB.

        "Read the following context and answer the question.\nContext: U.S. President Donald Trump filed his annual financial disclosure form this week with the Office of Government Ethics, the U.S. government's ethics watchdog.\nUnder U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency.\nIn Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than $100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for $130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop \u201cfalse and extortionist accusations\u201d about it.\nThe financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported.\nThat has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure.\nThe controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances \u2014 his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world.\nHere are six noteworthy takeaways from the report:\nGolf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to $210 million from nearly $300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than $20 million from $14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer.\nQuestion: What is probably true about the financial disclosure?\nAnswer:",

But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support.\nTrump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs.\n\u201cI will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,\u201d Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. \u201cThere has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.\u201d\nDemocrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it.\n\u201cIt rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,\u201d warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.\nDespite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump\u2019s base is largely sticking with him.

Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process.\nSo, our question for today is:\nWhat are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet?\nFirst, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life \u2013 although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life.\nWhat has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, stroke, heart diseases, etc.\nThat alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that.\nUnfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. \u2013 basically empty calories.\nObesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole.\nThere is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries \u2013 it\u2019s easier and tastier.\nThe author believes that:\n\nA. The standard diet for Americans needs more fruit\n\nB. The standard diet for Americans is unhealthy\n\nC. The standard diet for Americans contains too many carbohydrates\n\nD. not enough information",

Riah and I carried our gear on two trains and 1 bus to get to Claire\u2019s studio out in Wheelers Hill. I can see why Claire lives here as it\u2019s a pretty beautiful place, it\u2019s still suburban but there are trills, hills and birds everywhere, and for someone that\u2019s passionate about the environment I can see why she lives here. Meeting Claire was awesome, after having spoken via phone or email for so long, it was nice to speak to her in person. The filming of the interview went extremely smoothly, I\u2019d put this down to having planned out everything, such as all the questions I was going to ask prior to the interview. By this stage I had helped Riah film as well as Elise and it was noticeable how much smoother Riah\u2019s interview went because she had pre-planned her questions. Rather than spending an hour asking various questions that you might not use anyway, it\u2019s much more efficient to spend 20 minutes covering exactly what you want to cover. By this stage I\u2019d also had practise setting up lights, doing sound and getting camera shots for people\u2019s portraits so I already knew everything I wanted to shoot.\nOur setup was pretty simple, two large lights, one on Claire\u2019s front right and one on Claire\u2019s front left, two Canon EOS 60D DSLR\u2019s at different positions (one straight on, one to the side), a Sony H2N handy recorder and a lapel mic. Everything ran super smoothly, we did the interview first then myself and Riah shot various things in Claire\u2019s studio. Whilst shooting various things in Claire\u2019s studio we also got a chance to both speak to her which was nice, discussing what it is like to be a woman in Melbourne\u2019s art scene and finding out who some of her favourite artists were.

Clise, rescued as an emaciated kitten from a local park, grew up to be morbidly obese. His interests mainly involved eating food, begging for food, or going around the neighborhood scrounging for food. He could hear a can opener from a mile away.\nMonkey was a more active cat. He liked to chase the laser pointer and was the first to run to the door when someone arrived. But he could also be lazy, lounging in a sunbeam or stretched out on the couch.\nBoth of them liked to watch TV.\nSoon after I moved in, I started having health issues which necessitated a lot of time lounging around myself. This was the era of reality TV, back when much of it was actually good. The cats, Monkey especially, watched with me.\nMonkey definitely had his preferences. His favorite shows were The Girls Next Door and Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making The Team. Notice a theme here? Playboy Playmates and professional cheerleaders. Monkey liked his T & A (tits and ass).\nIf one of these shows was on, and I turned it to Project Runway or something, Monkey would march off. But as soon as I turned it back, and he could hear the high-pitched giggling, he\u2019d come running back.\nClise\u2019s favorite shows were Top Chef, Iron Chef, and Rachael Ray. Food porn. If there was something he especially craved, like a shrimp stir-fry, he\u2019d assume a begging pose, right in front of the TV, as if Rachael might take pity on him and throw him a scrap or two.\nI moved out about a year later.

He wore them almost all the time for the next thirty years after the War, then one day in the 1970\u2019s, he misplaced them. He was heartbroken, crestfallen, that he lost something he cherished from his military service\u2014the symbolic military issue Bausch & Lombs coveted by every officer who served.\nI wanted so badly to be my dad\u2019s Hero. I overturned every piece of furniture in the house, rifled every dresser drawer, every nook and crannie, underneath beds, the garage, the yard, you name it. I was on a Mission. I wanted to walk up to him and say, beaming, Here Dad! I found your sunglasses! But alas, after several weeks, no success. I was crushed by my own failure.\nHe passed away, and his possessions were divided among our family.\nFast forward to a few years ago. My Cocker Spaniel was sniffing around in the bathroom, and a box fell out of the bathroom closet with a crash. I went to investigate and chide the dog\u2026when the first thing I saw on the bathroom floor next to the overturned box was the yellowed leather case, and his wire rim sunglasses. I picked it up, held it in my hand, and I, a grown man, immediately burst into tears, sobbing. Suddenly, I was nineteen again. My wife asked what was the matter, and I told her the whole story.\nI figured after his passing, his sunglasses\u2014which evidently were in the house the whole time\u2014were probably tossed into one of many anonymous cardboard boxes, and I happened to be the one who carried off the box containing them.\nSo here Dad! I found your sunglasses! I love you! Am I still your hero?\nQuestion: The author found his dad's sunglasses:\nOptions:\n\nA. While his dad was dying\n\nB. After his dad died\n\nC. Before his dad died\n\nD. not enough information\n\n===\nThe correct answer is",

        "Since grade school we have known about the food pyramid, but the food pyramid I want to discuss today is quite different: The Mediterranean Food Pyramid.\nThe pyramid is used by countless health organizations, clinics, doctors and many others to guide people to eat in a healthy manner. It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously.\nThe pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed.\nThe pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region.\nOne of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways.\nThey are among the minority of the world\u2019s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic.\nThere are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) \u2013 plus a little red wine.\nYour fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily.\nFish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month. The rest of the time, vegetables, legumes, and/or pasta should be the focal point of your meals.\nFruit and vegetables (7 servings) should be consumed daily.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: Why do doctors use the Mediterranean Food Pyramid?\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. It gives a good summary of the unhealthy Mediterranean diet.\n\nC. It gives a good summary of the healthy Mediterranean diet.\n\nD. It includes processed foods.",

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source\u2019s ecosystem.\nI am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why.\nI find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said \u2018M$\u2019 instead of \u2018MS\u2019 (ugh.)\nThings have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me.\nThings have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don\u2019t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt.\nStill though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them?\nA little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft. After poking around his opinion, what shook out was that his real issue was not with Microsoft\u2019s open source work (he was supportive of this), but it was with the fact that they still produce...\nQuestion: The narrator's opinion of Microsoft changed because:\nOptions:\n\nA. after new CEO, they support open source\n\nB. during new CEO take over, they're not greedy anymore\n\nC. before new CEO, they supported open source\n\nD. not enough information",

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones.\nI had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20\u2019s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium.\nThe counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints.\nThere was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, \u201c He will die before morning. \u201c\nI suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness.

        "A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words!\nWhen was the last time it snowed?\n- a day ago\n- not enough information\n- a month ago\n- 2 weeks ago",

        "It\u2019s October, which means it\u2019s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time!\nBack when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.)\nNot all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren\u2019t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don\u2019t like needles.\nOr maybe they aren\u2019t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer \u201cstronger\u201d versions, designed for older adults?\nI\u2019m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic.\nBut it\u2019s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu.\nSo I agree with the CDC\u2019s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot.\nIn fact, I\u2019m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I\u2019m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza.\nThis month, you\u2019ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I\u2019ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll cover:\n* The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu\n* What to know about flu shots for older adults\n* What\u2019s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: How many people at the Centers for Disease Control hate needles?\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- Ten\n- Fifteen\n- Five",

        "David Gauntlett makes a good point in his newest book (Making Media Studies: The Creativity Turn in Media and Communications Studies) and that is that traditional forms of media studies are no longer applicable. Gone are the days of massive institutions and production companies, gone are the traditional audiences and simplistic texts. In, is the new age media companies, the everyday media makers, the consistent consumers and the fantastical mess of The WWW.\nWhile universities are pumping out the same content areas since the 1980\u2019s (e.g. institutions, production, audiences and texts) that are only relevant to a handful of media forms (cinema, television, online broadcasting and publications), the rest of the world is moving on. David Gauntlett so rightly says that creativity in media, should also refer to thinking creatively about the subject. What are the new ways of running media and communication studies? How has the subject itself changed? What approaches and methods can help media and communications studies to become innovative and useful in spheres beyond itself?\nDavid Gauntlett encourages a kind of call to arms, an acquiescence of the incapacities of the old system and a redirected gaze to the future needs of media students and media studies programs. Inspired by Tim Ingold\u2019s book Making, David believes media studies should have making at it\u2019s front and centre. He also believes the ability to do things with media should be embraced over and above the ability to talk about what others do with media, or what media does to us. The notion is that media studies should be hands on, that it should be all about ideas and critical engagement and this should be expressed through actual making.\nTo borrow three key distinctions from the anthropologist Tim Ingold:\n1. It\u2019s about learning WITH media rather than ABOUT media.\n2. There is an intent to move FORWARD rather than looking BACKWARDS at how things are.\n3. It\u2019s aims are TRANSFORMATIONAL rather than DOCUMENTARY.\nDavid Gauntlett probably believes that:\n\nA. universities have outdated content areas when it comes to media studies\n\nB. universities just want to make money\n\nC. universities need to have more creative media studies programs\n\nD. not enough information",

        "Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday.\nStudents and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day.\nWear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange \u2014 the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others.\nWhile the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \"pointless,\" and said \"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\"\nHere is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns.\nAny law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun.\nThat right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"\nThe Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state.\nTo purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record.\nHowever, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows.\nCertain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens.

These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action.\n\"It's better to use the legislative process,\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday.\nBut that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year.

So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal.\nOf course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized.\nThere is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal.\n#1 \u2013 Take It a Week at a Time\nYou must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction.\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, \u201cOver the long term, it\u2019s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.\u201d\nWhen you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week.\nYour long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it \u201cone week at a time\u201d (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks)\nIn addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don\u2019t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. .\nBUT . . .  the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear \u2013 and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process.\nIf you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing \u2013 and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target.\nMaybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself.\nHonest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.\nQuestion: who is this article for\nOptions:\n- fitness enthusiast\n- not enough information\n- people on diets\n- health nuts",

I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next.\nMurray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors.\nShe set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other\u2019s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like?\nStarting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a \u201cculture of obstacles\u201d.

Those days where the wind is so strong you can\u2019t instastory for talking (I\u2019m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer \u2018er, not sure\u2019.\nSo I thought I\u2019d get a few things off my chest, and confess a few of the reasons why I probably shouldn\u2019t be calling myself a travel blogger.

You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\"\nIn other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours.\nThe creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \"a local Amiga gaming championship\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest).\nThe school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.\nDuring the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC.\nQuestion: Who is Editor Frank?\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- Krzycho's friend\n- Krzycho's favorite editor\n- Krzycho's cousin",

But he also emphasized that Seoul would first seek support from the international community for any North Korean development projects, and would only proceed if the U.S. -North Korea summit, expected to be held in late May or June, produces a joint denuclearization agreement.\nNorth Korea is under tough sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council for its nuclear weapons and missiles tests, including accelerated efforts in the last two years to develop a long-range nuclear missile that could potentially target the U.S. mainland. The international sanctions ban an estimated 90 percent of the country\u2019s external trade.\nSeeking sanctions relief is considered a key motivating factor in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s diplomatic pivot this year to suspend further provocative missile and nuclear tests, and to engage in talks to dismantle his nuclear arsenal.\nBut easing sanctions would make it more difficult to enforce the North\u2019s denuclearization promises.\n\u201cOnce the sanctions are lifted, North Korea will gain autonomy over its trade, and considering its low labor costs and skilled workforce, I think the North Korean economy would gain power again,\u201d said Shin Beom-chul, the director of Center for Security and Unification at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has insisted he will keep sanctions in place until North Korea completely dismantles its nuclear program.\nSouth Korea, however, is considering a range of economic incentives to encourage Kim to follow through on a nuclear deal with Trump.

Trump said he was convinced of Kim\u2019s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North\u2019s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea.\nPresident Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon\u2019s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted.\nFriday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North\u2019s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.\nSouth Korean officials said there is possibility that Moon may join Trump in Singapore to help negotiate a nuclear deal with Kim, as the...\nWho has been influencial in making the U.S. and North Korea summit happen?\n- Canada's president\n- not enough information\n- South Korean president Moon Jae-in\n- Mexico's president",

In actuality, the latest German government statistics show reported crimes at the lowest level in 30 years.\nTough border enforcement in the U.S. has led to the family breakups, with nearly 2,000 children being sent to mass detention centers or foster care from mid-April to the end of May, according to government officials.\nThe regular White House briefing was delayed several times Monday amid the furor as officials huddled with Trump in the West Wing.\nPress Secretary Sarah Sanders finally introduced Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen after 5 p.m., and she defended the administration's \"zero-tolerance\" policy that is breaking up families at the southwestern U.S. border.\nNielsen forcefully pushed back at the negative media coverage, asserting that what U.S. authorities are doing is properly enforcing the law.\n\"What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire classes of people who break the law,\" she said.\nAsked about critics accusing the administration of using children as \"pawns\" to demand legislative actions from Congress, the DHS secretary replied, \"I say that is a very cowardly response,\" adding it is clearly within Congress' power \"to make the laws and change the laws.

When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas.

The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc.\nWhen I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different.\nThere was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway.\nMy pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded.\nMy alarm clock was on the floor.

The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and \u2014 with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on \u2014 Republicans need just two more signatures.\nBut that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next.

It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, \u201cIt says you have already played this role.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.\u201d She looked at me like I was lying.

His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don\u2019t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways.\nOne of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.)\nSo imagine it\u2019s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box.

        "Hello\nI have been chased by a couple of angry dogs. I was visiting one of my clients, when, suddenly, out of the bushes, two snarling dogs attacked me. They weren\u2019t necessarily mad, as in crazy, but they were very angry.\nThey were large dogs, and they attacked my legs, knocking me down. I knew it was very dangerous to be down on the ground, as I was most vulnerable. I covered my genitalia, my neck and my face, as I struggled to regain my feet.\nFortunately, during my fall, I saw a large tree branch on the ground near me. I grabbed it, and starting beating the dogs with it. I managed to land a few good hits.\nAs I was hitting the dogs, their owner (my client) came outside, stood on her porch and laughed at me. When she saw me hitting her dogs with a stick, she called the dogs off of me.\nI asked her why her dogs attacked me, and why she laughed at me. She said that she had just given her dogs a big steak bone and they were upset when I came near and attacked me.\nI asked her why she would set me up in this way when she knew I was on the way over. She admitted that she wanted to see what happened, and she said that when she saw what happened she thought that it was funny.\nI did not keep the appointment with her.

        "The First of March is my most hated day of the year. Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over.\nIn an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free.\nIf you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff.\nWhat is the narrator's favorite color?\n- Blue\n- Green\n- not enough information\n- Red",

We were living in an old house at the time and I was home alone with the youngest child (who was around six months old), balanced on my hip as I opened the door. The visitor looked genuine, dressed in the expected uniform. He was around 6.3 and probably not the most tidily presented utility man I'd met, but I believed him to be genuine and willingly invited him in out of the foul weather. It was pouring down outside, a freezing cold winter's day. As I closed the door I remembered that I should have asked to see his company I.D. , so as I opened the meter cupboard and switched on the light, I politely said, 'Oops, I should have asked to see your I.D. if you don't mind?. He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'.\nThere was an embarrassed silence. He continued to stare down at me without making a move for what seemed like minutes but was probably seconds. He didn't produce his I.D., instead he almost grudgingly read the meter as I looked on and then he swiftly left without saying goodbye. I closed the door and locked it, and then took a while to get my pulse rate back to normal and to realise I'd just learned a very big lesson.

        "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a great film, and often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don\u2019t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i\u2019m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I\u2019m very intrigued to properly analyse it.\nThe first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious \ud83d\ude09 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they\u2019ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame. It looks like they may have used a cutter to achieve that effect as its a very specific area, essentially just the top half of the cowboy thats drenched ins shadow. Theres also this curious black circular shadow which exists at the very top of the door near the cowboys head which permanently stays extremely dark, much darker than the rest of the shadows in the frame. I wonder how they achieved this effect? Maybe a...\nHow does the writer feel about the lighting in the movie \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly?\"\n\nA. he is impressed\n\nB. he doesn't think it is superior\n\nC. he doesn't care about it\n\nD. not enough information",

My grandfather\u2019s been falling.\u201d\nAfter all, falls are a scary thing. Most people know that falls are dangerous for older adults.\nThe Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that one in five falls causes a serious injury such as a broken bone or head injury. Fear of falling can also seriously affect an aging adult\u2019s quality of life and sadly, can keep a person from being active and thriving.\nSo, many seniors and family caregivers are interested in fall prevention because the risks are so great. And the good news is that although it\u2019s not possible to prevent all falls, it almost always IS possible to take actions that will reduce the chance of a bad fall.\nIf you want to learn more, you\u2019re in the right place.\nIn this post, I\u2019ll cover:\n* How understanding why aging adults fall can help you keep an older parent \u2014 or yourself \u2014 safer,\n* Why personalized fall prevention plans work better than relying on general fall prevention tips,\n* The four-step process I use to help older adults prevent falls,\n* A practical example showing you how to use these steps to avoid falls yourself.\nFirst, understand why older people fall\nThere are many reasons that aging adults fall. Most older people will be falling due to their own unique combination of reasons.\nSo how, exactly, should YOU go about reducing fall risk?\nNow, you can \u2014 and should \u2014 try to implement the general tips that are often listed in most fall prevention resources: exercise, medication review with the doctor, vision checks, and home safety reviews.\nBut if you really want to help an older loved one avoid falls, I recommend you learn to better understand why he or she, in particular, might fall.\nWhat is the author's occupation?\n- a doctor\n- a nurse\n- not enough information\n- a physical therapist",

It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough.\nAs the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn\u2019t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink.\nAt the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me.\nTo this day I\u2019m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn\u2019t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it.\nI woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend.\nShe eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart.

Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.)\nSo imagine it\u2019s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box.

        "\u201cHey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!\u201d\nI was passing through the hallways of school last year, being messenger boy for the teachers, when this girl walked up to me. I had no clue who she was, but I thought she was a year younger than me. That\u2019s why I thought it was weird that she said my name. But the \u201cnice sweatshirt\u201d bit was what really got me.\nI wasn\u2019t even wearing my sweatshirt.\nSo. There was a substitute teacher in my literacy class, so my class was split. half of us did actual work, and the other half watched a documentary. Ben, Evan, Isabelle and myself were put together in the class watching the super boring documentary. We got bored, so, when Ben left the classroom for a bit and left his jacket behind, I don\u2019t remember why, but, I put on his sweatshirt and traded it for mine. This turned into everyone swapping sweatshirts for the next hour until school was out. At one point I was called to the office to deliver a message to a different classroom. I walked out of the office with the information, and turned around at the sound of my name.\n\u201cHey, Natalie! Nice sweatshirt!\u201d I smiled and thanked her like the nice human being I want people to think I am. Once she started down the stairs I looked down at my sweatshirt. Black and orange? Nike? But my sweatshirt\u2019s gray and purple! Then I remembered our little game of \u201ctry not to get caught swapping sweatshirts and giggling\u201d. I wasn\u2019t wearing my sweatshirt. Someone else had it. I was wearing Evan\u2019s.\nIt\u2019s also kind of sad because that was one of the only compliments I\u2019ve gotten from a stranger all year. Complimented on something that wasn\u2019t even mine\u2026 Welcome to my life, everybody!\nWhat is probably true about Natalie?\n- She wears her sweatshirt a lot.\n- She gets a lot of compliments about her looks\n- not enough information\n- She starrts trends with her friends",

        "In the 1970s I was a student nurse in psychiatry. I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet.\nOne of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, \u201cYou think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!\u201d as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse.\nI worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved.\nI was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been.\nIt is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: Who was the impatient nurse?\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- Connie's personal nurse\n- The narrating nurse's ward colleague\n- The narrating nurse's school classmate",

        "That fall came and I went back to Michigan and the school year went by and summer came and I never really thought about it. I'm not even sure if I was officially asked, I just wound up heading back to New Jersey when school was out. I think my parents thought it was a good enough deal. They were already having some problems and without Nonna there anymore to take care of me I think my cousin's house on the coast seemed like as good a spot as any to stick me for the summer. It certainly wasn't because of any great love between me and my cousin. We weren't really very good friends at that point. I think she saw me as sort of foisted off on her and getting in the way of her summers. Which was a fair enough judgment. But she could have been nicer. It's pretty amazing that she wound up as my Maid of Honor. Time does strange things. Your lovable jack-ass of a father would mention something about magic in here. You know if you took a group of fifty strangers, had them chat with your father for half an hour then with me for half an hour, then told them that one of us was an English Professor and one of us was head of distribution in the northeast for a large soft drink manufacturing concern, I'm pretty sure all fifty would peg your father as the English Professor and me as the head of distribution. He's honestly so good at what he does that I can almost allow him to claim it's magic except that it'd be nice if he took credit for some of the things he's done with his life. Of course he has this idea that he deserves credit for all sorts of things that he had no control over.

Since I have always been interested in other cultures, I was happy to go along. While we were sitting at a table together, an older man came up and asked to buy me a drink. I told him \u201cno thank you, I do not drink\u201d. My arm was laying on top of the booth because I was sitting sideways since my big old pregnant belly would not fit under the table. He reached over and took my hand and said \u201c Come dance with me then\u201d. I again told him I was not interested in dancing. He began to squeeze my hand and insisting I get up and dance with him. I kept telling him no, and pointing to my belly and saying I would not be dancing with anyone. He just kept squeezing my hand harder and trying to pull me out of the booth. I got angry when I felt something break in my hand and screamed at him \u201cGet your effing hands off me!\u201d The bar owner came over to see what the problem was.

        "The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it\u2019s because they\u2019re just so easy to use. I\u2019ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let\u2019s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces\u2026.\nAlthough the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different \u2013 MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here.\nMAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil \u2013 this is the first lip pencil that I\u2019ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I\u2019m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it\u2019s not sticky.\nThe colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a \u2018soft plum with pearl\u2019. It\u2019s definitely a plummy shade, although I can\u2019t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it\u2019s very sheer it appears much more natural once it\u2019s on the lips. It\u2019s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you\u2019re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm!\nThe crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it\u2019s quick and easy, and as it\u2019s very light and sheer it\u2019s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply.\nQuestion: After the end of the passage, what color will the narrator probably buy in the MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone.\nThere may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet \u2013 others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle.\nHowever, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, diabetes and much more.\nThe diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways.\nRed meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today\u2019s world are simply not eaten.\nIt should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle.\nThe Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue.\nLet\u2019s look at some of the potential difficulties.\n1. The diet can be expensive.\nWhen you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work.\nBut . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all.\nThe writer thinks that:\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. the Mediterranean diet should be for everyone\n\nC. the Mediterranean's diet health benefits outweigh the cost of the diet\n\nD. the Mediterranean diet costs too much for the health benefits it provides",

His imagination ran wild with thoughts of kissing her full lips while his hands explored her lean, muscled body. Tonight he didn't need the whiskey to warm him up. But he kept drinking it anyway. She stepped away from the mike, sat her acoustic guitar on its stand, and walked down from the small stage. Jason beat all the other losers to the bar and sat down beside her. \"You must be pretty thirsty after all that beautiful singing.\" How many times had she heard that line? But at age 33, she'd probably heard every pickup line known to man. \"Yeah,\" she said, giving him a quick glance. He wasn't a bad looking guy. Probably a couple of inches shorter than her. At six-foot-two, she was accustomed to that. But a lot of men couldn't deal with her height. They liked to be the tall one in the relationship. Not that she'd had many relationships. Mostly one-nighters.

Did you write it yourself?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Wow. It was sad, but moving. You've got talent.\" Here we go, she thought.

The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. \u201cIf our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,\u201d she says, \u201cthe medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.\u201d\nLarisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes\u2019 unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don\u2019t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the \u201cmonstrous peoples\u201d as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade.\nThis work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. \u201cScholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,\u201d says Larisa. \u201cThese manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...\nQuestion: How does Larisa feel about her time spent at the University of Pennsylvania?\nAnswer:",

She needed something, something that she could grab onto, and hold, hold until it hurt, hold until blood made racing red lines down her arms, until her hands were raw. She left the room and walked quietly into the now guest room that had been Rob's. Opening the closet, she found the teddy bear that Rob had once confided in and held it in her arms tight as she slumped down on the bed. A quiet sobbing rang through the house accompanied only by the chime of the grandfather clock in the living room every fifteen minutes. As Jan lay on the guest room bed she soon resorted to deep gasps, knowing that meager tears would never be forceful enough to express her worry to those that listened. \"Just bring him home, bring him home, bring him home,\" she mumbled over and over, each time changing the tone slightly in a desperate attempt to make her pleading sound more real.\nShe could hear the occasional snore of her husband and she hated him for it. What kind of person could find sleep at a time like this? Why wasn't he awake worrying? Why wasn't he with her? Her thoughts became dark like blood, evil little monsters eating at her sanity. If her son was crazy and not just a drug addict she could see how easy it was to fall over the line. \"Please God, please God, please God, please Rob, Please Rob, Please Rob, Please Rob.\" Soon, a sleep came but it was peppered with demons.

        "Americans may become accustomed to the political turmoil swirling around President Donald Trump, but it remains an open question whether that turmoil will ultimately help or hurt Trump and his Republican allies, especially in an election year.\nLast week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania \u2014 a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections.\nThis week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe.\nTrump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe.\nEarlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \"assurances\" that firing Mueller was \"not even under consideration.\"\nThe latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\"\nThe tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy.\n\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\nThe renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: why does Trump continue tweeting?\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- he has a large ego\n- he thinks it is helping.\n- he thinks he is witty",

To qualify this, I\u2019m not normally bothered by product placements. Sometimes they can even add to the scene. But this one was bad, really bad.\nAgent is busy hunting for baddies. Finishes questioning one naughty person who climbs in his Ford F150 and speeds off. So far, so good - it is the sort of vehicle a country-living billionaire bad-guy would drive.\nThe agent then pulls out her phone and\u2026\nMove to close up of phone screen showing Ford app already loaded (and screen unlocked!). Agent slowly moves finger to app. Does something. Pause as app does fancy graphics.\nCut to car interior. Shot of dash, showing Ford logo on steering wheel. It\u2019s bright blue - are they not normally grey or more subtle? Pause for a second\u2026\nZoom in on dash. Dash light up. Car starts. Show pretty dash lights for a second or so. Cut to agent\nAgent walks to car, gets in drives off. Lingering shot of rear of car.\nIt was just so clumsy. Massive halt to the flow of the scene to show it. In most films you never see anyone starting cars, putting on seatbelts or similar unless this is part of the plot because it\u2019s unnecessary and not interesting to watch. I sort of expected the remote start function to have some sort of relevance later\u2026 but no, it was totally ignored.\nAdded to that:\nThere was no password or security on her phone - and this is an agent investigating super secret stuff. If you don\u2019t show her unlocking the phone, why show her lovingly prodding the app? They are as relevant.\nShe unlocked and started the car while she was 20\u201330 paces away, on the grounds of a suspect ranch. Someone could easily have jumped in the car. Not very security conscious.\nQuestion: What kind of truck did the naughty person drive?\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- Ford F150\n- Country billionaire\n- Ford F250",

        "In this article, I\u2019ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood.\nThis is sometimes referred to as \u201cchecking labs,\u201d \u201cdoing bloodwork,\u201d or even \u201cchecking blood.\u201d\nMost older adults have been through this. For instance, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it\u2019s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or \u201ccomplete physical.\u201d\nLast but not least, blood testing is usually \u2014 although not always \u2014 very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults.\nFatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things.\nConfused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person\u2019s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more.\nLike much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it\u2019s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person\u2019s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults.\nHistorically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it\u2019s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health.\nIn fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!)\nThis way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you\u2019ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself.\nIn this article, I\u2019m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: The author probably believes that:\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- they are only recommended to aging adults\n- laboratory results are accurate\n- laboratory results are easily understandable without interpretations from medical doctors",

His state-of-the-art mail delivery vehicle, an old green Ford with busted air-conditioning, sometimes elicited sympathy from those along his route, but the ones with beer were the best. However, Justin just looked through his mail and then began watching the sky.\n\"You ever think about gravity?\" Justin asked suddenly.\n\"No,\" admitted Old Zeke, wiping the perspiration from his forehead. Justin sighed a little.\n\"You ever fall off your ladder?\"\n\"Well,\" considered Zeke. Damned if this wasn't a round-about way to offer a fella a drink, but maybe after all this Justin would offer him a beer instead of that watery lemonade he made. \"Yeah.\"\n\"How long did it take you to fall?\"\nWell hell, muttered Old Zeke under his breath. Maybe all those stakes he was driving in had given Justin a touch of the sun. The thought made him consider hauling Justin back to town, although the truck might finish the job the sun had started.\n\"A second or two,\" Zeke replied.

        "When I had trouble bending over to tie my shoes and I wasn\u2019t pregnant. When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn\u2019t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn\u2019t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn\u2019t lose weight.\nWhat I didn\u2019t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier.\nMy second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn\u2019t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason\u2026 Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down.\nI will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn.

So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows.

He was the Ambassador to 1975, but back home in 1898, in New Jerusalem, Utah, they all thought he was Ambassador to France. When he disappeared, Mama and I came back through the triple-bolted door that led from our apt in 1975 to our horsebarn in 1898. We returned to the dusty streets of New Jerusalem, and I had to keep on reminding myself that I was supposed to have been in France, and 'polly-voo' for my chums, and tell whoppers about the Eiffel Tower and the fancy bread and the snails and frogs we'd eaten. I was born in New Jerusalem, and raised there till I was ten. Then, one summer's day, my Pa sat me on his knee and told me we'd be going away for a while, that he had a new job. 'But what about the store?' I said, scandalised. My Pa's wonderful store, the only General Store in town not run by the Saints, was my second home. I'd spent my whole life crawling and then walking on the dusty wooden floors, checking stock and unpacking crates with waybills from exotic places like Salt Lake City and even San Francisco. Pa looked uncomfortable. 'Mr Johnstone is buying it.' My mouth dropped. James H Johnstone was as dandified a city-slicker as you'd ever hope to meet. He'd blown into town on the weekly Zephyr Speedball, and skinny Tommy Benson had hauled his three huge steamer trunks to the cowboy hotel. He'd tipped Tommy two dollars, in Wells-Fargo notes, and later, in the empty lot behind the smithy, all the kids in New Jerusalem had gathered 'round Tommy to goggle at the small fortune in queer, never-seen bills. 'Pa, no!' I said, without thinking. I knew that if my chums ordered their fathers around like that, they'd get a whipping, but my Pa almost never whipped me.\nQuestion: My Pa disappeared somewhere in the wilds\nOptions:\n\nA. before 1975\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. during 1975\n\nD. after 1975",

        "Trisha dreamed of being a Playboy Bunny since the days she still had buck-teeth and fried egg boobs. She blu-tacked page threes above her bed-head and had me snap topless Polaroids till they littered the floor. She told me to imagine she had 36DDs and peroxide blonde hair. I used to wish like hell that she wasn't my cousin. When she was fifteen Trisha started putting out for the boys in the Kwik-Save car park for a tenner a time. She said she was an entrepreneur, not a prostitute. She started going steady with a kid called Keith. He was a fryer in the fish and chip shop. He had a future and a Ford Cortina. She got a job waitressing and she worked all the hours she could. Keith couldn't handle me and Trisha being as close as we were. Especially the time he caught Trisha bending over me in nothing but a frilly market stall thong while I worked the angles best I could to get a dangle-shot. Next night he took her in the car park woods and doped her up to the eyeballs. He took out a bottle of India ink and told her he would etch the love-heart she'd always wanted. Instead, he safety-pinned the word 'inbred' into her arse. Trisha's step-dad tracked the spits of blood and found her sobbing in the bathroom of their long-stay static. It didn't take him long to slap out the truth. He went straight round to Keith's place with a crow-bar and did enough damage to make sure he'd need more than laser treatment to put things right. Keith wasn't rolling in spare change so Trisha's step-dad took the Cortina as payment in lieu of her getting herself fixed up. Trisha got me to stash the Cortina up the lane at the back of Boyes' farm. Weekend nights, I drove her out to the dual carriageway truck-stop where she found a faster way to make her fortune in the fogged-up cabs.\nQuestion: Keith took Trisha to the woods:\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources.\nSomething I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing.\nAn effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap.\nWhile at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits:\n* Direction \u2013 one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle.\n* Documented commitments are more effective \u2013 a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project.\n* Feeling of success \u2013 regularly revisiting a roadmap and...\nQuestion: The narrator probably believes\nOptions:\n\nA.

But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA.\nA bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote \u201cstrikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,\u201d Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said \u201cthe strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.\u201d Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, \u201cOur whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.\u201d\nIf the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide $50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates.\nBut the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill\u2019s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate.\nIn a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization.\nJeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act \u201cwere anchored in falsehoods.\u201d\nHe added the legislation passed today \u201cis a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration\u201d a move also welcomed by many House Republicans.\n\u201cRather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,\u201d House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican...\nQuestion: After the end of the story, what would Donald Trump hope the Senate does?\nOptions:\n- Pass the bill.\n- Reject the bill.\n- not enough information\n- Table the bill.",

        "WASHINGTON \u2014 Legal experts cast doubt Tuesday on a list of questions the special counsel purportedly wants to ask President Donald Trump, saying they would expect the veteran prosecutor to ask more and more pointed questions.\nThe New York Times published the list of 44 questions it said special counsel Robert Mueller plans to pose to Trump as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nThe newspaper reported that the list was compiled by Trump's lawyers based on questions that were read to them by special counsel investigators.\nThe largely open-ended questions range from queries about Trump's firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, to general inquiries into what Trump knew about alleged coordination between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia.\nWhile the list reflects the general line of questioning the special counsel's investigation is believed to be focused on, legal experts said the questions published are not what Mueller \u2014 or any prosecutor for that matter \u2014 would ask an interview subject.\n\"It doesn't sound like questions that a prosecutor would typically ask, unless it was just a very general information-gathering type of inquiry, and they'd not limit themselves to only those question and reserve the right to ask follow-up questions,\" said Eric Jaso, a partner at the Spiro Harrison law firm who served as an associate independent counsel during the Whitewater investigation of former President Bill Clinton.\nThe questions, Jaso said, were likely written by Trump's own lawyers, based on a conversation with the special counsel about topics he wants to query.\n\"If Mr. Mueller is going to interview the president, I suspect that he's going to ask rather pointed questions rather than having questions that would allow the president to basically give a narrative and potentially go far afield from the topics that they're trying to focus on,\" Jaso said.\nPaul Rosenzweig, an adjunct professor at the George Washington School of Law...\nWhen did Pres Trump fire Flynn and Comey?\n\nA. before the article was written\n\nB. after the article was written\n\nC. not enough information\n\nD. while the article was being written",

        "SEOUL \u2014 The U.S. has indicated it is prepared to open the North Korean economy to significant private investment, if a nuclear deal can be reached. But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment.\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment \u201cin spades\u201d to build up the country\u2019s infrastructure and develop its economy.\n\u201cThis will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,\u201d said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program.\nThe Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit.\nThe Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North\u2019s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies.\nDuring the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country\u2019s repeated nuclear and missile tests.\n\u201cThey obviously want to make concessions, a lot of...\nQuestion: Why did North Korea release the prisoners?\nOptions:\n\nA.

Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\"\nTrump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security.\nCrime assertion\nTrump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens.\nHowever, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year.\nFollowing intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \"zero tolerence\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children.\nQuestion: President Trump's vow to end Immigration Crisis will probably take:\nOptions:\n\nA.

But it is still unclear if real progress toward peace can be achieved.\nThere have been two past inter-Korean Summits in 2000 and 2007, both held in the North. The first produced a joint peace declaration promoting humanitarian exchanges and economic cooperation.\nFrom the second came support for a permanent peace treaty and a U.S. and China-led deal to end Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons program for economic assistance and security guarantees.\nHowever, North Korea\u2019s continued nuclear development efforts and missile tests, in violation of past agreements, and other hostile acts, including a alleged deadly attack on a South Korean naval ship in 2010, brought an end to any progress made at these summits.\nLeading up to this week\u2019s inter-Korean summit, there are encouraging developments that a nuclear deal may again be within reach.\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s maximum pressure campaign, that led efforts to impose harsh international sanctions ending most North Korean exports, are exerting increasing economic pain that could be pressuring the leadership in Pyongyang to actually give up its nuclear arsenal this time.\n\"If the situation continues, the foreign exchange could be depleted and North Korea can face a very serious situation at the end of this year. This is one of the reasons why it has come out in favor of dialogue,\" said Cheong Seong-Chang, a senior North Korea analyst at the Sejong Institute in South Korea.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made a number of concessions already by agreeing to talk about denuclearization without conditions, by appearing to drop past...\nQuestion: Why was there a halt in the progress made at the 2000 and 2007 summits?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon.\nI don\u2019t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along.

Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station.\nNow, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So \u2026 I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too.

If Moore wins, Republicans will retain their 52-48 majority in the Senate, but a Jones victory would pare the margin to 51-49, possibly further complicating Trump's efforts to pass his legislative agenda.\nPre-election polls at various times have shown both Moore, 70, and Jones, 63, in the lead, but the history of elections in deeply conservative Alabama runs against Jones.\nNo Democrat has won a Senate election in the state since Richard Shelby did in 1992, and two years later he switched parties to become a Republican. Still a senator, Shelby said Sunday that he voted absentee for \"a distinguished Republican\" as a write-in choice, but could not bring himself to vote for Moore after one woman, now in her 50s, said Moore abused her when she was 14.\nMoore, twice deposed as a state Supreme Court justice for failing to follow federal court rulings, has accused journalists, Democrats and establishment Republicans in Washington of trying to undermine his campaign. Some Republican lawmakers, a number of whom said Moore should drop out of the contest after the women's allegations surfaced, said they would try to expel him from the Senate if he won.\nQuestion: What state did Moore run in for Senate?\nOptions:\n\nA. mississippi\n\nB. kentucky\n\nC. alabama\n\nD. not enough information",

        "Just minutes after Donald Trump fired Rex Tillerson on Tuesday, the president was blunt about his long-standing differences with his former secretary of state.\n\u201cWe disagreed on things,\u201d Trump told reporters outside the White House, specifically pointing to friction over the Iran nuclear agreement.\n\u201cI wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe were really not thinking the same.\u201d\nTrump reportedly had considered firing Tillerson for months. But the decision - and the abrupt way it was executed - represents a dramatic end to a strained relationship.\nTillerson learned of his firing by an early-morning Trump tweet, according to Steve Goldstein, undersecretary of state. White House officials disputed that notion, and promptly fired Goldstein.\nThe move left some of Trump's staunchest defenders with mixed feelings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very Trumpian,\u201d said James Carafano of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who helped staff the State Department as a member of Trump\u2019s transition team. \u201cWhen the president makes changes, he just abruptly makes them.\u201d\nDuring his 14 months at the State Department, Tillerson had numerous policy differences with Trump - and the friction frequently played out in public.\nThe animosity peaked in October, when news surfaced that Tillerson reportedly called Trump a \u201cmoron\u201d following a July Pentagon meeting. Tillerson never explicitly denied the account.\nTillerson also publicly disagreed with Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord. He reportedly opposed Trump\u2019s decision to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\nAnd Tillerson sometimes took a tougher stance than Trump on Russia \u2014 including this week, when he blamed Moscow for a suspected nerve agent attack in Britain.\nIn return, Trump on numerous occasions publicly undermined his top diplomat, including in October when he tweeted Tillerson was \u201cwasting his time\u201d trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nWhen Trump ultimately made his decision last week to...\nAfter the firing, how will people see trump?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- A good leader\n- As a bad president.\n- As a dictator\n- not enough information",

Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands.\nBy the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves.\nDuring the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn\u2019t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain.

        "Read the following context and answer the question.\nContext: To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle.\nThere is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction.\nIn addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being.  By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges \u2013 including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression.\nPractices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being\nAccept Your Feelings\nStuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful.  Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode.\nUnfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs.\nRather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don\u2019t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them \u2013 especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness.\nIt takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety.\nDon\u2019t stuff your emotions!\nLet yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand \u2013 not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip.  This is nature\u2019s way of releasing stress.

        "U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Lindsey Graham have joined a growing chorus of Republican leaders to disavow comments by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump about the Mexican heritage of a judge in a class-action lawsuit against Trump University.\nQuestioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \"I regret those comments he made. Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of racism.\" But he did not retract his endorsement of Trump, made last week, and he said he does not believe Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton is \"the answer.\"\nRyan made his comments during an appearance at a women's shelter in Washington, D.C.\nIn a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States.\nGraham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\" he said.\nThe backlash appears to be mounting against the candidate, who has repeatedly said he believes U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \"Mexican heritage,\" would not rule fairly in the case charging Trump with fraud. Curiel is an American who was born and raised in the Midwestern U.S. state of Indiana.\nU.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during the campaign, tweeted: \"Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.'''\nSasse was joined Monday by two former rivals for the Republican nomination.

My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I\u2019d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero.\nThat illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we \u201csee\u201d data.\nMy dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as \u201cpalaeobiologists\u201d \u2013 meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin\u2019s time, palaeontology \u2013 especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record \u2013 involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy).

        "It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency.\nDonald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign.\n\u201cIt was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,\u201d Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival \u201cprobably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d\nIt was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim.\nTrump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally.\nThose numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president\u2019s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.\nWhen did Donald Trump and the Americans meet?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- At 3 in the morning\n- not enough information\n- In the afternoon\n- At 6 in the evening",

Ever since those first interactions we have become really close friends.\nToday Stuart turns 40 and I just wanted to share a few words about how remarkable a human being he is.\nMany of you who have listened to Stuart on Bad Voltage, seen him speak, worked with him, or socialized with him will know him for his larger than life personality.

He is not just a brilliant programmer and software architect, but he has a deft knowledge and understanding of people, how they work together, and the driving forces behind human interaction. What I have always admired is that while bombastic in his views, he is always open to fresh ideas and new perspectives. For him life is a journey and new ways of looking at the road are truly thrilling for him.\nAs I have grown as a person in my career, with my family, and particularly when moving to America, he has always supported yet challenged me. He is one of those rare friends that can enthusiastically validate great steps forward yet, with the same enthusiasm, illustrate mistakes too. I love the fact that we have a relationship that can be so open and honest, yet underlined with respect. It is his personality, understanding, humor, thoughtfulness, care, and mentorship that will always make him one of my favorite people in the world.\nHow will Stuart likely feel after the speech?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- humiliated about what the author said about him\n- honored that his friend thinks so highly of him\n- angry because he didn't like being the center of attention\n- not enough information",

        "As academic work is becoming arguably more precarious and competitive, shorter contracts are becoming the norm, and the number of people completing PhDs in the UK is increasing, the risks associated with researching academia are high. This post discusses and explores my experiences of being a PhD student researching women\u2019s lived experiences of research evaluation in the UK, and my thoughts on and experiences of interviewing very senior and esteemed academics as a junior researcher.\nMy PhD study explored research evaluation in the form of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) \u2013 a weighty force in UK academia \u2013 the outcomes of which, I argue, hold the potential to alter the course of an academic career considerably, as well as playing a role in the type of work that some academics do, particularly given the REF impact agenda.\nThere is currently an international trend towards research evaluation with programmes such as the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), the Performance-Based Research fund in New Zealand (PBRF), and equivalents in countries including Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. What is clear is that there is not enough qualitative, exploratory research into the effects of research evaluation on academic careers, especially for women, and so my PhD study was born. My findings suggest that research evaluation in the UK actively contributes to the continuance of gender inequality regimes in the academy, and that the ability to negotiate managerial control and be politically savvy is increasingly important in the academic world.\nBefore embarking on my PhD, I was acutely aware of the sensitivity of my research, as well as my own positionality with regards to my participants. Reflection is and was an important element in the research process for me, as it allowed me to reflect on the effects of the self on the research process and, ultimately, also on the data, as well as the various power dynamics discernible during interviews for my study.

        "If you visited the Getty Center in July or early August, you may have encountered a group of high school students wearing white lab coats with \u201cTeen Lab\u201d splattered across the back. You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney\u2019s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes.\nThe teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018.\nThe Getty\u2019s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning?\nTo address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2)\nThe Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems.\nWhat was the inspiration for the selfies?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- Testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials.\n- Scientific process.\n- David Hockney's photocollages.\n- not enough information",

Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over.\nIn an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free.\nIf you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff.\nQuestion: The manicure probably lasted\nOptions:\n- A day\n- A year\n- A hour\n- not enough information",

        "Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer who is under investigation for his business dealings, has provided legal advice to Fox News host Sean Hannity, one of Trump\u2019s most prominent media supporters.\nThe dramatic revelation came Monday during a court hearing in New York where lawyers for Cohen and Trump argued for permission to determine whether thousands of pages of documents FBI agents seized from Cohen last week should be subject to attorney-client privilege.\nU.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood appeared to reject the idea, saying that a \u201ctaint team\u201d created by prosecutors to set aside privileged documents is a \u201cviable option,\u201d while a court-appointed outside lawyer known as a \u201cspecial master\u201d may also play a role in determining which records can and cannot be viewed by prosecutors.\nThe disclosure about Hannity, who also hosts a nationally syndicated talk radio show, came after prosecutors indicated that Cohen performed \u201clittle to no legal work\u201d and had just one client: Trump.\nIn response, Cohen\u2019s lawyers said that Cohen has represented three clients in the past year \u2014 Trump, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and a third \u201cpublicly prominent individual\u201d who wished to remain anonymous. Cohen's lawyers identified Hannity as the third unnamed client only after Judge Wood ruled that it must be made public.\nIn a statement, Hannity sought to minimize his relationship with Cohen, saying he had never retained him as a lawyer.\n\u201cMichael Cohen has never represented me in any matter,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cI never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.\"\n\u201cI assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third-party,\u201d Hannity said.\nFox News also responded to the revelation. \"While Fox News was unaware of Sean Hannity's informal relationship with Michael Cohen and was surprised by the announcement in...\nHow long was the meeting between Fox News and Hannity?\n\nA.

        "It would have to be this\u2026\nDonald Trump once cashed a $0.13 check\u2026\nIn 1990, writer from a \u201cSpy Magazine\u201d had a great idea for a prank:\n\u201cWhat would happen if you sent checks for small amounts to celebrities and saw who cashed them, putting to test the theory that every man (and woman) has a price? In their words:\n\"We could however, send them checks for minuscule sums of money\u2014sums so small they couldn\u2019t fund as much as a minute of the recipients\u2019 existence\u2014and see who would bother to bank these teensy amounts of money.\"\nSpy thought \"some subterfuge\" would be necessary\u2014it'd be suspicious to get a check from the magazine that lampooned so many of the intended recipients. This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \"short-fingered vulgarian.\"\nSo, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988\u2014what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for $1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks\u2014Donald included.\nThe magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for $0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen\u2014including Donald Trump\u2014deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks.\nThen they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for $0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump.\nSeriously.\u201d\nI really don\u2019t know if this is the most \u201ccheapskate\u201d thing, on just CRAZY fiscal responsibility. But if I had to pick, this would get my vote\u2026\nresources: Splinter - The truth hurts\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nOf all the celebrities, why did Trump deposit the smallest check?",

Thelma Schoonmaker, the film editor whom my previous post was about was one of those people; she got into editing after seeing an ad in the New York Times. I\u2019m in no way suggesting I\u2019m going to make a fortune, nor that I\u2019m a Thelma Schoonmaker in the making, but I certainly do make a lot of benign choices.\nArt blogging, for me, was one of those benign choices. I made the decision to start an art blog very randomly, so randomly I\u2019m not even sure where the idea came from. At the time I had been studying a bachelor of psychology for about two years and found myself interested in the subject, but underwhelmed with the lack of creative ideas and media I was being exposed to.\nI\u2019d always been interested in art and most creative mediums, often recording music or taking photographs on the side. But the pages and pages of white and black scientific journal articles must have got to me, because I found myself yearning for splashes of colour, moving imagery, challenging concepts and undefinable ideas. The next thing I knew I had started an art blog aptly titled: Artistic Expansion and I began spending hours a day searching through the internet for content, often finding my best pieces in the most random places, often not even defined intentionally as \u2018art\u2019.\nOver the last two years I must have blogged hundreds of multi-coloured, multi-textured and multi-layered images, accumulated over 2000 followers and consumed more art than I ever had in my entire life. I find it interesting not because of it\u2019s success, but because before I started my art blog, I really had no idea how much I did or could love art and once I had made my art blog I  couldn\u2019t imagine how I ever functioned without it.\nWhat does the author converse with friends about often probably?\n- not enough information\n- engineering\n- science\n- art",

It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success.\nAdd a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine\nA simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities \u2013 the things you are going to do anyway.\nFor example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster.\nAs you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories.\nWhen it\u2019s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can \u2013 stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal.\nWhen you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song \u2013 make those tiles shine.\nPlay fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum.\nWork for longer periods of time \u2013 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there. It gives you more time to get your heart rate going and a better boost to your metabolism.\nThese are things you can do to keep your house sparkling and build the new you.

        "One of the more surprising objects in the Getty Villa\u2019s newly reinstalled gallery of later Roman sculpture is a marble bust of a youth leaning out of a circular frame, mounted high on the gallery wall. J. Paul Getty originally acquired this particular sculpture in 1973, but it has been off view for many years. The recent reinstallation of the Getty Museum\u2019s antiquities collection at the Villa provided the opportunity to resurrect many such objects from storage and put them on display.\nBringing this strange object back to the public eye enabled us to ask\u2014and answer\u2014several questions about it. Who\u2014if anyone\u2014does it represent? When was it carved? Where was it made, and how did it end up in Los Angeles? In preparation for its display, we researched and reinterpreted the object, exploring both its ancient function and modern history.\nIn its new display, this object is fittingly surrounded by other examples of late Roman sculpture from the third and fourth centuries. Its inclusion in this gallery was not always a given, however, as the figure was long misidentified as a portrait of young Caracalla, who at ten years old became joint emperor with his father in A.D. 198.(1) But recent scholarship questioned the Caracalla identification and the object\u2019s date, suggesting it was carved at least a hundred years later.(2) In light of this research, curator Jens Daehner pushed to reexamine the sculpture and consider including it in the reinstallation.\nIn early 2015, the Antiquities Department brought this tondo and many other potential objects for the new galleries out of storage for viewing, providing curators, conservators, mount makers, preps, and registrars a chance to approve and prepare artworks for possible display.\nAfter the storage viewing and subsequent research, we updated the object record to conform with what scholars had suggested: this is not a second-century portrait of Caracalla but a fourth-century bust of a youth or divinity. To answer our next question of who the tondo represents, we then had to take a...\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nHow did Jens Daehner feel about the bust?",

At that point, I started to get the idea\u2026 but that was as far as I thought anything was going to happen as I thought, hunh, OK, maybe she misses her fiance. I know I do.\nThen we progressed to (very quiet) sex at her request. As far as we knew, everyone else in the room was asleep - at least they never hinted at knowing.\nWe dated another month or two while we were both there.\nI was so clueless as to how she felt and it took FAR too long to figure out what was happening.\nWhere did they have sex?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- At a hotel in the couple's bed.\n- At a hotel in girl's bed.\n- At a hotel on the floor.\n- not enough information",

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps.\nClean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet.\nSome of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating.\nA major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself.\nUse Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer\u2019s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer\u2019s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive.\nFor example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers.\nWhen you first start reading about clean eating, you may find \u201cexperts\u201d expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is \u2013 they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don\u2019t have to eat them just start a clean eating.\nIf you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don\u2019t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those \u2013 you will be doing just fine.\nQuestion: What does the narrator probably like to do?\nOptions:\n- Grow her own food\n- not enough information\n- Buy fresh foods from farmer's markets\n- Cook clean foods for others",

Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands.\nBy the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves.\nDuring the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn\u2019t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain.

Also, my bride did not have a lot of intricate buttons on her dress, nor did she wear gloves or even have sleeves.\nWe were wed on a beach, just the two of us. No one else was in attendance.

        "The battle lines are drawn once again. U.S. law enforcement agencies and Silicon Valley are getting ready to face off on the issue of privacy.\nThis latest battle is focused on a 30-year-old law on government access to electronic communications and associated data. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act was a forward-looking statute when enacted in 1986, but technology has dramatically outpaced the ECPA.\nThe U.S. Congress has been looking into ways to revise the law in order to preserve the privacy of internet users while also preserving the legal tools necessary for government agencies to enforce the law and protect the public.\nThe late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called privacy \"the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.\"\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee this week is considering an amendment to the ECPA that would expand the government's ability to collect data using a National Security Letter, which doesn't require a court order. The amendment would authorize the FBI to demand a person's internet browser history and internet protocol address, enabling investigators to see what websites a person visits, how much time is spent on a particular site and the location of the internet user \u2014 all without judicial oversight.\nThe FBI contends that such data is covered implicitly under current statute, which was written years ago and only explicitly covers data normally associated with telephone records. FBI Director James Comey has said the amendment is needed to fix \"a typo\" in the ECPA that has hindered the bureau's ability to work in \"a very, very big and practical way.\"\nBut a letter sent earlier this week warned Congress that such an amendment is opposed by tech giants and civil liberties organizations.\n\"This expansion of the NSL statute has been characterized by some government officials as merely fixing \u2018a typo' in the law,\u201d the letter said. \"In reality, however, it would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users' online...\nHow does the FBI probably feel about the Supreme Court?\n\nA.

A wall of bookcases dominated the living room, each shelf crammed with two, sometimes three layers of books, videotapes, CD's and DVD's. More stacks of books and magazines stood in every corner. Paul was certain they would have taken over all the other flat spaces as well, were it not for the half-assembled computers and three dusty old monitors occupying the coffee table, end tables, and everything in between.

A large red and black checkered blanket covered one of them, while the other was cracked but still serviceable brown leather. Thrift store purchases both, Paul thought.\n\"The computer stuff belongs to one of my roommates,\" Chloe said. \"She's always fiddling with those things to get better performance or whatever. The books are mostly mine or my other roommate, Kurt's. Come on into the kitchen and we'll rustle up a sandwich.\"\nPaul followed her back into the open kitchen area, which (given that he was ostensibly here to have lunch) he was relieved to see was clean. There was clutter in there certainly, but no dirty dishes or leftover foodstuffs appeared in evidence. Along the left wall was a cheap, plastic patio table with long wooden benches on each side and miss-matched chairs at either end. Newspapers, books, and a laptop occupied most of its surface area, but the end closest to Paul seemed clear enough to see actual use as a place for dining.\n\"Is peanut butter ok?\" she asked, motioning him towards one of the chairs.\n\"Sure,\" he said and sat down at the table. As she started to prepare a couple of peanut butter sandwiches on white bread she said, \"So, tell me Paul, why are you getting fired tomorrow?\"\nQuestion: Who owned the laptop?\nAnswer:",

These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action.\n\"It's better to use the legislative process,\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday.\nBut that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year.

Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive.\nThe 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration.\nThe school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision.

But it is still unclear if real progress toward peace can be achieved.\nThere have been two past inter-Korean Summits in 2000 and 2007, both held in the North.

Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in \u201cthe real world\u201d (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here \u2013 I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting \u2013 was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda?\nI learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and \u201cembarrassing\u201d. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda?\nBecause of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments).

The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don\u2019t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the \u201cmonstrous peoples\u201d as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade.\nThis work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. \u201cScholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,\u201d says Larisa. \u201cThese manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nWhat event led to Larissa focus on the evolution of depictions of India?",

        "For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don\u2019t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps.\nI started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn\u2019t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual.\nWhen I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don\u2019t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly.\n1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT)\nRecognise the gift your body is giving you.\nMy belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone.\n2. FORGIVENESS\nAcknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past.\nI am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly.\n3. GRATITUDE\nNotice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it.\nI am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that\u2019s it\u2019s not too late to take great care of you.\nQuestion: After the end of this story, the narrator probably is\nOptions:\n\nA.

        "My fraternal twins were born 2 months early. The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women\u2019s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said \u201cWhatever doesn\u2019t kill me, makes me stronger\u201d.\nHow did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I\u2019d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped. The twins are 37 now.\nHow long were the children in the NICU\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. Several years\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. A few days\n\nD. A year",

        "Yes I had. In a domestic violence case (in which I was the accused, but by God I was innocent) with my ex girlfriend, the lawyer whom I hired and paid his dues, openly played a wheeling and dealing game for two and a half years with the prosecutor and had mercilessly thrown me in front of the prosecutor. My ex girlfriend was sexually abused by her own uncles at the age of 5 to 9, had a lot of illusions and psychological problems, along with Bi-Polar Disorder, however, dispite my requests, she never had ever visited a psychologist or psychiatrist in her then 24 years of lifetime, fearing she would be forced to unveil the uncles\u2019 child sexual abuse act and this would cause her dismissal from her immediate family. Although I mentioned this to my \u201cso called\u201d lawyer, he refused to mention her unstable psychological condition in the court. I believe by doing so, he also committed a crime by preventing a child sexual abuse case go unveiled.

In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I\u2019m \u201calways busy.\u201d\nSeventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled.\nA mother\u2019s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn\u2019t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning.\nMy usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him.

In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot.\nDemocrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country.\nIn New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president.\n\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally.\nIn Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration.

But North Korea is acutely aware that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown and killed by his own people a few years later, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the United States.\nPyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until its undefined security demands are met.\nTrump blamed the \u201ctremendous anger and open hostility\u201d from Pyongyang for forcing the cancelation of the summit, but many analysts say the issue was more about substance over tone and the unbridgeable gap between the two denuclearization positions.\nBut...\nQuestion: When did Kim Kye Gwan say that his country remains open to resolving problems with the United States?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020.

Instead, they are production facilities for undergraduates and college entrants. Fewer are set up to systematically provide apprenticeship opportunities as well as learning. At NoTosh, we\u2019ve been working on a few, nascent projects to change the attitudes of schools from being these production facilities into something more of a life support - what metrics of success might we use if schools judged their success on the results of their alumni, five, ten or twenty years down the line, much like universities do?\nCity of Glasgow College have partnered with Newlands Junior College (NJC) to make the experience of a day in college more than what, in other circumstances, is too often perceived as a day off from school.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams.\nCries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm.\nDuring the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die.\nAs the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power.\nAt the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames.\n\"Form around them,\" called the leader of Roland's party.\nRoland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders.

        "Once again, I've analysed my year of travel to see if I'm any closer to reducing it year on year. It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing.\nKey to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure.\nThe quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: Who coaches online?\nOptions:\n- scholars\n- Many teachers who want to reduce travel\n- online teachers\n- not enough information",

She had pain relief as and when needed to make her comfortable and that often results in people ultimately overdosing.\nMum had Alzheimer's and was howling and writhing in agony so we were giving her pain relief but daughters knew it would probably result in her death - which they were right about possibly happening and in their grief and panic, started trying to prevent us from doing anything. Didn\u2019t want us getting near her at all and we had to go through an awful scenario of trying to explain what we had to do for Mum and why and when they still wouldn\u2019t have it or allow us near, we had to do what nobody wants and go against their wishes by administering the pain relief anyway.\nOne daughter screamed the place down, threatened to have me arrested and struck off / said she would go to the papers and tell them about how we killed her Mum and in the end she had to be removed from the bedroom.\nHer Mum was given the pain relief, immediately relaxed and fell asleep then died peacefully in her sleep about 15 mins later.\nThe saddest thing is her daughter wasn\u2019t able to be there and see her Mum dropping off so peacefully and her last memory will forever be of her screaming and thrashing about as she (daughter) was physically removed from the room.\nTragic.\nQuestion: The writer probably believes that\nOptions:\n- the daughter does not care about her mum\n- the daughter is mean and cruel\n- the daughter is thoughtful\n- not enough information",

Scores of demonstrators have been arrested, with one flash point being the southern city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where DeRay McKesson, one of the most prominent activists linked to the police reform protest movement Black Lives Matter, live streamed his own arrest.\nPolice defended his arrest as a matter of public safety, but demonstrators told U.S. news outlets they believe McKesson was targeted.\nMcKesson was freed on bond Sunday afternoon after being charged with obstructing a highway. \"I remain disappointed in the Baton Rouge police, who continue to provoke protesters for peacefully protesting. There's a lot of work to be done, with this police department specifically,'' he said.\nBut Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards disagreed with McKesson's assessment. The governor told a news conference Sunday that he is proud of the state's law enforcement officers, calling their response to the protests \"moderate.\"\nIn the northern city of St. Paul, Minnesota, where a second man, Philando Castile, was shot to death last week by a policeman after a traffic stop for a broken tail light, hundreds of protesters hurled firecrackers, rocks and bottles at police on Saturday.\nThe heavily armed officers used smoke grenades and...\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nWhy was DeRay McKesson protesting",

So this is about fulfilling our promises to the American people.\"\n\nHowever, since the president was last in the country, he and his Republican allies in Congress face a new political landscape in the wake of last week's gubernatorial election victories by Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey.\nIn Virginia, exit polls showed that many voters were motivated primarily by their opposition to the president.\n\"The fact that the president is so polarizing and so unpopular with approval ratings generally under about 40 percent, and Democrats are going to be extra-motivated to come out,\" said University of Virginia political analyst Kyle Kondik.\nKondik said the strong Democratic showing in statewide races in Virginia last week was the best non-presidential election showing for the party since 2006, the last time Democrats nationally won control of the House of Representatives.

I tell you now, so that you will know that my last thought was of you. I have placed my affairs in order -- do not fear, my love, you will be well provided for -- all that is required of my remaining time is to explain the events which have led to my death. Though the scene will seem so similar to my elder brother's death, I would not wish you to think I had taken my own life in the manner in which Edmund took his. When Dr V came to see me some weeks ago, he brought with him the bottle of strychnine that now sits empty upon my desk. He was in high spirits, because his latest alchemical experiment had been a success, and brought the strychnine in order to demonstrate the efficacy of his elixir. In truth, his very presence could be considered proof, since he had been dead earlier that morning, but, as I had not witnessed his revival, he wished me to see the results first hand. At his request, I summoned the chambermaid, while he prepared a syringe of strychnine. I thought he would ask her to procure a hen or some such thing for use in his demonstration however, when she arrived, Dr V-- plunged the syringe into her arm with no warning. I leapt from my chair, but before I could do more than cross the room, the strychnine took effect with results that horrified me. Even though I had complete confidence in Dr V's elixir, I could not restrain a cry of dismay as the chambermaid's head tilted back in a sudden convulsion.

        "Earlier this year my depression got very bad, very quickly. I\u2019d been having intrusive suicidal thoughts for a while. It was a combination of a bad medication regimen and lots of little stressors\u2014school, work, a car accident, you name it. I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn\u2019t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead).\nOne night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account.\nI don\u2019t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn\u2019t specific, but rather something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to handle this.\u201d\nWhatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he\u2019d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me.\nI was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams.\nCries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm.\nDuring the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die.\nAs the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power.\nAt the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames.\n\"Form around them,\" called the leader of Roland's party.\nRoland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders.

The U.S. has not released 2001 to 2003 airstrike data.\nThose figures do not include activity by the Afghan Air Force (AAF), which has stepped up its aerial bombardment since gaining the ability to conduct airstrikes two years ago. The AAF carries out between 4 to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense.\nIf recent trends are any indication, 2018 is likely to get even more violent. Fighting traditionally picks up during the warmer months, and the coalition has expanded its bombing campaign against the Islamic State group, as well as narcotic labs and other Taliban revenue sources.\nBut there is little indication the expanded airstrikes are helping end the conflict, says Thomas Johnson, an Afghanistan specialist who teaches national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.\n\"It's basically a tactic of desperation,\" said Johnson, author of Taliban Narratives: The Use of Power and Stories in the Afghanistan Conflict. \"There's never been an insurgency in history that's been defeated purely through air power.\"\nEven high-level U.S. military officials concede the conflict remains a stalemate. According to the latest U.S. military estimate, the Afghan government controls 56 percent of Afghanistan's districts, with insurgents controlling or contesting the rest.\nInsurgent attacks also have continued. Nearly 60 people died Sunday when an Islamic State...\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nWhat country is Trump putting more airstrikes in for 2018?",

        "I love going to the spa. Honestly, who doesn't. These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas.\nI had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage.  Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!).\nQuestion: What did the therapist probably do after the author's massage?\nOptions:\n- she went to see the in-laws \n - she went to visit the beautiful model \n - not enough information \n - she performed another massage\n===\nThe correct answer is",

Their route varied from night to night, but the ultimate destination was never in question.\n\"May I help you?\"\nThe worn-out speaker was crackly, but he still recognized the particularly twangy East Texas voice of Fontana Fry.\nOver his six years of vocal training, he had become acutely aware of accents. This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French.\nSo, by the time Greg finished his graduate degree, his accent had been all but eliminated.

The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully. It looked somewhat like a large violin, with arched top and f-holes. That shape produces a more mellow sound than flattops.

Until I was a senior in high school, I had never been to a salon.\nI don\u2019t even remember why I went this time. Mom was going to have her hair done, and I had tagged along. She asked if I wanted a cut too and I said why not? So while Mom was getting her hair done I looked through the books and picked out a cute pageboy style that I liked. Finally it was my turn and after talking with the stylist and showing her what I wanted, she led me to the shampoo station.\nNow, as everybody who has ever been to a salon knows, you sit back in the chair with your neck in the indentation and they wash your hair. But I had never been to a salon. When mom washed my hair after dyeing it, I always leaned over the sink. So \u2026 I started to climb into the chair and lean over the sink here, too. My mom was mortified and the stylist couldn\u2019t figure out what in the heck I was doing. Mom calls out, \u201cNo, Jennifer \u2026 you sit in the chair.\u201d I look over my shoulder at her and then realize what I\u2019ve done. Red-faced, I stand up and then turn around to sit and lean back in the chair. I honestly wanted to die right there. I\u2019m pretty sure the stylist thought I was developmentally delayed or something because she talked to me for the rest of the time like one would talk to a three-year-old. Mom tried to explain that I\u2019d never been to a salon before, but I think that just made the situation worse.\nThankfully I\u2019ve been to many salons now and understand how everything works, but I\u2019ve never returned to THAT one.\nQuestion: The stylists probably feels:\nOptions:\n- bored \n - not enough information \n - angry \n - surprised\n===\nThe correct answer is",

Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment.\nThe disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a \u201creportable\u201d liability, Trump chose to list it \u201cin the interest of transparency.\u201d It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president\u2019s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn\u2019t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year.\nThe Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met \u201cthe disclosure requirements for a reportable liability\u201d under the Ethics in Government Act.\nUnder the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of $10,000 during the previous reporting period. \u201cKnowingly or willfully\u201d falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties.

I know that, know it for a fact. But he is dead. Why? I am not foolish enough to suspect \"foul play\" as they say in the mystery stories. No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either. He was a little crazy, but not that kind of crazy. Still I keep half expecting to pick up my voice and hear his voice yell, \"Gotcha!\" But it is no joke. I know he is dead. (Later) Got a package today. From Walter. Scary considering what I wrote about expecting him to call. I can't express the chill I got when I saw his name on the label. A message from the dead. Surely it's not a good Omen. It's a painting. Or at least I think it is. The package is the right shape, and knowing Walter it seems likely, but...I haven't yet worked up the courage to open it yet. I'm afraid of what I might find. April 3, 2006 Went to the funeral today. Walter's wife, Martha, was in hysterics. Can't say I blame her. It was awkward being there seeing someone in the most vulnerable possible condition. I didn't know her that well. Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away.

With all these new things, I got a new assignment which was supposed to be submitted in 3 days.\nOur teams were formed and we, together had to submit it. From dawn to dusk, we worked hard on that Economics project. I worked with each and every person in the group. I didn\u2019t know how to plot a triple axis graph in excel, I learnt that day at 2 am. Our group also learnt many new things and we gave our 100% to that report.\nI, in my entire academic life, have never been careless towards the submission. I always submitted reports or assignments before time.\nAnyway, the submission day finally arrived. I had told one of the group members to print the report out and bind it and bring to the college with her. The lecture is scheduled at 2:00 pm. I called her for about 30 times asking where she was. She didn\u2019t pick up any of our calls.\nThere she entered the lecture hall at 2:07 pm and our professor being a strict one, rejected our project. Everything was washed out. Our efforts were washed away.\nWhat was the reason of she being late? Traffic!

Inside the theater the movie echoed him: \"Because all of you of Earth are idiots!\"\nTom sighed, not for the first time that evening. The Manager, who paid in cash every Sunday, had decided to take advantage of the bizarre tastes of his Generation X clients and offer an Ed Wood film festival. Bride of the Monster, Plan 9 From Outer Space, and Night of the Ghouls ran on the second, smaller screen on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, two bucks a head. The Manager was making a killing.\nTom, who needed the job in order to move out of his parents' trailer home, found little about the Ed Wood canon amusing, although it was light-years beyond anything by Coleman Francis. Even so, Tom had been forced to hear the dialog of each film, on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday... He only had to watch them once, having filled in for the Manager's weasel-featured nephew/projectionist Neoldner, who had called in sick to buy grass in Beloit. But he would have been able to forget the experience had it not been for the penetrating soundtrack which bled into the lobby.\nThe ordeal, for tonight, was almost over - the concession stand closed after Plan 9. He hoped he had sold enough to keep his job - there was the worry that the Manager would increase his profit margin by manning the concession stand himself. But the Manager strolled out of the second theater with a broad grin, revealing his cutting overbite.\n\"I don't know why,\" the Manager exclaimed, \"but they love it!\"\n\"Most of them are from the 'Ed 9 Film Society,'\" Tom replied. \"By the way, I need to restock the chocolates.\"\nQuestion: How old was Ton?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

But a national Southern Baptist spokesman said the pastor's wishes will be taken into consideration.\nOther sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere.\nA one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13.

A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby.\nAlso Thursday, the father of the Texas gunman broke his silence to say his family is in mourning.\nMichael Kelley spoke to ABC News on Wednesday from his home in New Braunfels, about 55 kilometers north of Sutherland Springs.\nHe refused to comment further, saying he does not want the \"media circus'' surrounding the attack by Devin Patrick Kelley to destroy \"our lives, our grandchildren's lives.''\nA motive for the carnage remains unclear, but the younger Kelley appears to have targeted the church because it was attended by his wife's family.

Call her R.\nR was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories:\nShe wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \"miracle cure\" company who was along those lines! \"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts.\nShe received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham.\nAt which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\" Which is awesome.\nI still feel for her.

        "The U.S. Supreme Court plunged into the politically messy issue of redrawing congressional and legislative districts Tuesday, in a case that could have profound implications for both major political parties for years to come.\nThe high court heard oral arguments in a case brought by Democratic voters in Wisconsin. They argued that a Republican redistricting plan for the state assembly was so overtly partisan that it violated constitutional protections of freedom of speech and equal protection under the law for Wisconsin voters.\nA lower federal court sided with the challengers last year and against Republican state officials in Wisconsin. Officials argued Tuesday that they had not violated any constitutional rights when they drew up new boundaries for state assembly districts. \"Our legislature followed traditional redistricting criteria, which is what they have been required to do and we think they followed that and that the justices will agree,\" Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel told reporters in front of the court following the oral arguments.\nThe process of state legislatures redrawing congressional and legislative district boundaries has been enmeshed in politics for two centuries. Early on, the process was referred to as \u201cgerrymandering,\u201d where one party or the other tries to gain an electoral advantage by redrawing district boundaries to maximize their voting clout.\nRepublicans have had success in several states in redrawing congressional and legislative voting districts and that has helped them maintain their majority in the House of Representatives. Democrats have come under fire as well for partisan maps in states where they control the legislature, like Maryland and Massachusetts.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments, the more liberal high court justices seemed open to the case brought by Democratic voters.

One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled \u2018Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination\u2019. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: \u201cI would like filmmakers interested in thinking \u201coutside the box\u201d to recognize that they can benefit from being placed \u201cinside a box.\u201d I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio.\nThroughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to \u2018think more creatively\u2019. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological  and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states \u201ca genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work\u201d.\nConstraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their  projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...\nQuestion: What did the writer research\nAnswer:",

        "WASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government\u2019s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than $100,000 for unspecified expenses.\nIn his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had \u201cfully reimbursed\u201d his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of $100,000 to $250,000 in 2016.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for $130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier.\nTrump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop \u201cfalse and extortionist accusations\u201d made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment.\nThe disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a \u201creportable\u201d liability, Trump chose to list it \u201cin the interest of transparency.\u201d It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president\u2019s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn\u2019t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year.\nThe Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met \u201cthe disclosure requirements for a reportable liability\u201d under the Ethics in Government Act.\nUnder the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of $10,000 during the previous reporting period. \u201cKnowingly or willfully\u201d falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report.\nCritics seized on...\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: Why would Trump reimburse his lawyers?\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. to cover up his purchase of illegal properties\n\nC. to cover up a sexual tryst\n\nD. to cover up a robbery gone bad",

His shoulder length blond hair was coated with the shine of someone who has only wet their hair down and not washed. His red streaked eyes were a sure sign of his having been recently woken up. He watched Dorian backing his way through the doors pulling a gurney behind him. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said, then immediately fell silent as Dorian turned around. There was panic in Dorian's eyes and a waxy pallor beneath the stubble on his face that betrayed a lack of sleep. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said again, that one word betraying multiple emotions: a layer of fear spread over top concern for his friend, concern for his own wellbeing, and simple anger at letting himself become involved in this. \"Hook her up,\" Dorian said before moving to a lab stool of his own and sliding a keyboard across the table to rest in front of him, his fingers impatiently tapping the spacebar while he waited for the monitor to respond. With a hiccup of light the screen became active making Dorian's face even more hollow with its sickly glow. He was normally a handsome man with short brown hair that was always perfectly combed. Tonight, though, it was full of unruly licks and his white lab coat, which usually added to his presence as the overall leader of their research team, was cast by the computer's light into awkward shades of green and blue. A large coffee stain down the front appeared to still be wet. Cedric didn't respond. \"I said hook her up,\" Dorian said. \"Dorian,\" Cedric said for the third time. \"I said hook her up!\" Dorian screamed and Cedric jumped forward to the gurney.

When we were kids, we dreaded accompanying her to Wal-Mart, or worse, the Cosco at the edge of town, where the echoing rafters and limitless aisles seemed to mock the confusion into which we were inevitably thrown when handed torn-off fragments of the list. Of course, it was easy enough to see in hindsight that \"2dozjumHerbal Essences\" was merely the bastard child of two drunkenly weaving columns--we had been supposed to get two dozen jumbo eggs and a bottle of my mother's favourite brand of shampoo (ever inventive in creating proprietary abbreviations--\"TC\" standing for, what else, thin crust pizza--my mother scrupulously wrote out brand names in full).\nIt was a little like ordering chemicals for a laboratory, sans any knowledge of chemistry--or, for that matter, laboratories, although my ignorance of the distinction between baking soda and baking powder cannot be entirely the root of my confusion. Eventually I--and my siblings--learned the difference between tomato paste and tomato sauce, and could readily distinguish one brand of laundry detergent from a similarly-styled knock-off, but my shame-faced trips back to the mothercart never ceased.

We can go fast. We can go slowly.\"\nThe president made clear that sanctions on North Korea would not be lifted, however, until the country agreed to give up its nuclear arsenal.\nAs the negotiations over the Singapore summit play out in public, there is a sense among some observers that Trump and Kim Jong Un each have a clear sense of the deal they ultimately want to strike.\nLess clear is whether the U.S. and North Korean visions can match up in any meaningful way.\n\"Singapore might be the first time people will have to put their cards on the table,\" a U.S. official said on the condition of anonymity.\nUpon his arrival Friday at the White House, Kim Yong Chol, who is under U.S. sanctions for links to cyberattacks against American companies, delivered a letter from Kim Jong Un.\nWhile Trump did not reveal the contents, he described the gesture as \"very nice.\"\nQuestion: When would the Singapore summit occur?\nAnswer:",

He was sitting in about forty feet of water, stone dead, one arm pinned between the rocks. As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it. My mouth was dry from breathing canned air and the carbonation burned like fire. Winslow, from the sheriff's office, sat down next to me. 'I appreciate this, Dan,' he said. 'No problem.' Sam Winslow and I had grown up together about twenty miles outside Austin in a little town called Coupland. We'd fought a lot as kids, and there were still plenty of differences in our politics and educations. But being on the police and fire rescue squad had brought me closer to him again, and I was glad of it. A private detective needs all the friends he can get. 'What do you make of it?' I asked him. 'Accidental drowning, looks like.' I raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. 'He's got a bump on the head that could have come off a rock. We'll see what the coroner says.' 'Any idea who he is?' Winslow shook his head. He'd gained weight in his face recently and his jowls vibrated with the gesture.\nQuestion: When did Dan get a coke?\nAnswer:",

This is a gray drizzling rain. A rain that makes him think of places like England and Scotland as they appear in those disturbing late night films on cable, the ones in black and white that weren't particularly memorable when they were made and are even less so now.\nStill, it rains and the air is cool. All he has to shelter him is a think nylon jacket. The jacket is soaked. It feels both chilly and coarse against his skin. His hair hangs in flat and sodden wings, falling into his eyes. It's long in the back, almost to his shoulders, and he thinks that the cars that pass him on the street, the occupants of those cars, might look at him and see only that he is wet and not that he is dirty as well. Can they tell that his hair has been unwashed for days? That his clothes are the same ones he's worn for more than a week? It doesn't matter. He's invisible to them as soon as they pass, taking any assumptions they might make with them. They might just mistake him for one of those hoity-toity college kids, one of those clean limbed and beaming have's who has happened to find himself caught out without his umbrella.\nHe makes a desultory attempt to straighten his shoulders, to lift his eyes from the buckled sidewalk.

Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other.

        "A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat.

The law had never been able to break up the Preacher's drug operation, even though it was notorious as the biggest in Texas. \"How'd they do it?\"\n\"It's very hush-hush,\" he said, steam from his coffee making his hair seem to ripple. \"They squelched the story at the papers, hoping to pull in a couple more fish, I guess. But what I gather is that the thing was pulled off from the inside, from somebody high up in the organization. But nobody knows exactly who it was that sold out.\"\n\"It'll all come clean at the trial, I suppose.\"\nHe nodded. \"Sooner than that, I expect. The DA told me confidentially that they'll have everything they need by five o'clock tonight. You'll see it all on the evening news.\"\nA sharp rapping came at the door and Pete stood up.\n\"You've got business. I'll leave you to it.\"\n\"It's probably bill collectors,\" I said. \"I'll yell if they get rough.\"\nHe opened the door and pushed past the two policemen that were waiting outside.\nThey were both in uniform, but I only knew one of them. That was Brady, the tall, curly headed one that looked like an Irish middleweight. His partner was dark and nondescript, sporting a Police Academy moustache.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What type of illegal drugs was the Preacher selling?\nOptions:\n\nA.

        "\"Hey, guy.\"\n\"No, this is Ray.\" He smiled, leaned back in his chair.\nIt was, of course, Pete. Pete was the night shift guy at Crossroads Detox across town. Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry.\nApparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam.\nPete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year.\nThey had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab.\n\"What's the problem?\" Ray asked.\n\"I have a recalcitrant.\"\nThat's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly. Pete's vocabulary did not include the word shithead either in its singular or plural.\n\"Pete, they're all like that. Alcohol is bad medicine. That's why places like ours are in business. To make them calcitrant.\"\n\"I know that.\" Pete sounded a little annoyed.\nThere was some commotion in the background, a knocking on doors.\nHow long has Pete been a CPA for?\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. 5 years\n\nC. 1 year\n\nD. 20 years",

But ask him now he feels about that decision, and you get a tepid response.\n\"I'm not sure,\" Poskin said.\nLike many farmers in the Midwest, Poskin is concerned about getting caught in the middle of a trade war, as Trump ramps up economic pressure on China.\nThose fears were heightened after Trump announced plans Thursday to impose tariffs on as much as $60 billion worth of Chinese imports.\n\"I'm fearful they will retaliate on those tariffs,\" Poskin said. \"Soybean exports, wheat, poultry, chicken, beef \u2014 [there are] any number of products that we export to their country that they could retaliate with.\"\nThe announcement has unnerved many in Trump's base of supporters in U.S. agriculture. The trade tensions have also rattled global markets, which until recently had performed strongly.\nTrump's tariff decision was meant to punish Chinese companies that benefit from unfair access to U.S. technology.\nU.S. businesses have long bristled at Beijing's requirement that they transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entering the Chinese market. U.S. businesses have also had their technology stolen through cyberattacks.\n\"We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on,\" Trump said during the signing ceremony Thursday.\nSome U.S. companies in China cheered the move and suggested that concerns about a trade war were overblown.\nWilliam Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, dismissed the \"hair on fire\" concern that Trump's proposed moves would hurt the global economy.\n\"That the U.S. is willing to risk these disruptions indicates how serious the U.S. administration finds China's forced technology transfer, cybertheft and discriminatory industrial policies,\" he said in a statement to VOA.\nZarit pointed to a recent survey suggesting members of his organization wanted the White House to \"advocate more strongly for a level playing field and for reciprocal treatment to...\nQuestion: What is it that farmers are afraid of?\nOptions:\n\nA. bad blood\n\nB.

It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps.\nI started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn\u2019t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual.\nWhen I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don\u2019t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly.\n1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT)\nRecognise the gift your body is giving you.\nMy belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone.\n2. FORGIVENESS\nAcknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past.\nI am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly.\n3. GRATITUDE\nNotice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it.\nI am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that\u2019s it\u2019s not too late to take great care of you.\nQuestion: The narrator's look in the mirror probably lasted\nAnswer:",

        "Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own.\nI\u2019d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  \u2014 it\u2019s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination \u2014 and texture \u2014 wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results \u2014 absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness.\nBut when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I\u2019m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field\u2019s The Italian Baker.\nField recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I\u2019m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing \u2014 maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What is probably true about the narrator\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- She likes baking\n- She likes to dig\n- She likes to hunt",

I\u2019ve been officially on the job in the web department for all of 12 hours. I\u2019m sitting in a conference room at a big wooden table, surrounded by my new coworkers and team members in the Getty\u2019s web group.

It had a very small town feel. I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay.\nNow, my son and I were invited to a birthday party for this FIVE year old. The sole Parent had rented the club house, surrounding grounds and pool area of a local country club. I would estimate around 30 kids x 1.5 adults. It was catered with both adult and children's foods and beverages, including Wine and Champagne (few here seem able or willing to parent without it). A company was hired to bring in 6 industrial fair/carnival type rides. A mini Ferris Wheel and a mini Roller Coaster included. She even had hired help that distributed Party Bags/Swag Bags that included cologne/perfume for the kids. I don't think my jaw closed the entire time we were there. This was for a FIVE year old!

It was our third visit to the area (on one of them I snapped up this recipe for persimmon cake), so I feel it\u2019s about time to share some our favourite things that we\u2019ve been shown by locals.\nTrento is only a four hour drive from Florence \u2014 passing Bologna and Verona on the way, which could make very good pit stops if you feel the need to, FYI \u2014 yet it feels a world away in terms of the landscape and the food, from the golden, rolling hills of Tuscany. Cue towering mountains harbouring mushrooms and berries, lush valleys and turquoise lakes, vines grown on pergolas, enormous plates of sauerkraut and polenta in abundant portions, delicious wines and rustic cakes with German names.\nTrento is the capital of Trentino, an unusual region of Italy because its official languages are Italian and German and it is actually made up of two self-governing provinces and is known as Trentino-Alto Adige or Trentino-Sudtirol. Confused? Since the eighth century, it has been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and only a century ago did it become Italian. It is squeezed between Lombardy and the Veneto to the west and southeast and to the north lies Austria and Switzerland. So it is no surprise that many of the food influences come from its neighbours \u2014 particularly the northern ones.\nEating in the region means eating heartily, even in the summer sunshine, we enjoyed abundant portions of canederli (large rustic dumplings made of bread, herbs and meat, ham or cheese in broth), masses of soft, creamy polenta with thinly sliced roast pork or sausage ragu and slow-cooked beans or thick venison steaks, sauerkraut and gnocchi (sometimes made of out of polenta). I think one waiter was highly disappointed that we weren\u2019t able to finish our gargantuan plates one hot day on a mountain with a view of the Dolomites.

A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \"Did it get either of you?\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \"No\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \"Are you hurt?\" \"Mm...My hand.\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \"Did he claw you or bite you?\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge. Ranur paused and then spoke low. \"He bit me.\" Char picked Lorfel and Ranur as his hunting partners for their speed and sharpness in battle. They had hunted beasts of the deep woods all of their lives. They hunted the beasts that hunted men. They all knew the risks of battling such creatures. The old man dropped his curved sword, drew his bow, and fired. The arrow hammered into Ranur's chest, burying itself in his heart.

Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's.\nOf course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint.\nDr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron.\nAnd so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.\nThe result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order.\nThe narrator believes that:\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA.

The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea.\nKim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North\u2019s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North\u2019s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North\u2019s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel.\nIt is unclear if Kim Jong Un\u2019s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing.\nSouth Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state.\nThe two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation.\nThe leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the \u201cBridge of No Return\u201d that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War.\nMoon and Kim will hold direct talks in the Peace House conference hall, both in the morning and the afternoon, but the North Korean delegation will...\nQuestion: What is the most probable reason President Moon Jae-in will hold a welcoming ceremony for Kim Jong Un?\nAnswer:",

If a court determines the firing was not for \"good cause,\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation.\nWhile marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea.\nThe legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller.\nMueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \"witch hunt.\"\nDespite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller. He told the cable show Fox and Friends on Thursday that he'll \"try and stay away\" from the Justice Department, but \"at some point, I...\nQuestion: What do the Democratic senators most likely think?\nOptions:\n\nA.

They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh.

The best known version is told by my husband Marco\u2019s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family\u2019s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners.\nOne day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. \u201cHe was no adonis,\u201d noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed.\nWhen Anna\u2019s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter\u2019s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto \u2014 Mario, Marco\u2019s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War \u2014 but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work.\nNonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as \u201csugo di nonna Anna\u201d and, oddly, \u201camatriciana\u201d (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta).\nBut these polpette \u2013 plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia \u2013 were passed down to Anna\u2019s daughter in law, Angela\u2019s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,...\nQuestion: What is probably true about the polpette?\nOptions:\n\nA.

It\u2019s been done or almost been done before in Scottish education, but the answers have been ignored as they pass us by. The simple clue is this: poverty is single biggest predictor of achievement, and according to research (Hammonds sic, reference required), aged 10, a child living in poverty is 60% less likely to get to university.\nBoyd borrowed from his own mother\u2019s report card to ask us what kind of education we desire. Is it the academic success at all costs route, or is there another option we need to value as much, if not more? His mother\u2019s report card, one that prevented her from becoming a secondary school pupil in Glasgow, is filled with G and FG, until the last point: Character and conduct - excellent.\nWhat kind of pupils do we want to develop in Scotland? What do we value in our assessment system? Opening up opportunity for all is a tough game to play when the examination system rewards only certain types of behaviour, few of them related to what the Curriculum for Excellence says we stand for. In his own small community in East Kilbride, three secondary schools enter a period of meltdown as the local rag sets about creating its own local league table of performance, with those three \u2018teams\u2019 in competition for the top spot (or at least not the bottom one). Therefore, we must stop basing \u201cthe gap\u201d largely on attainment.\nFirst of all, Boyd would like us to remove the traditional, and non-sensical academic/vocational divide. Is the law or medicine degree we value not vocational? (Are all General Practitioners not Plumbers, as Dr Murray on the panel suggests?)\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: In whose own small community in East Kilbride is the writer referring to?\nOptions:\n\nA. Hammonds\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. Dr. Murray\n\nD. Professor Brian Boyd",

        "The nice thing about a city like Vegas was that when a man walked into a drug store covered in blood and reeking of sweaty dog, it was business as usual. I stepped up to the counter and threw down the bandages, handi-wipes, some sports drinks, and three pounds of beef jerky. Some girl with green hair and a pierced head was behind me chatting on her cell phone about flying out to Amsterdam to catch a P show at the end of the month. It took all I had not to turn around and strangle the life out of the waifish little nit.\n\"--means Power. Fargo18 said it's a reference to Damon's first girlfriend, but he's full of shit. Paula was his sister, not his girlfriend. Hey, did you know their guitar player is related to a serial killer? That's so hot. I hear--\"\nI leaned in close toward the cashier. \"Can you ring this shit up a little faster?\"\nAs I walked out to the Jeep with my booty in hand, Cerberus sat in the passenger seat and casually watched me approach. In the few hours I've been with the dog, it never once threatened me. But its mindless stare made my skin crawl. And I was going to have to put the top up soon. This dog was far from predictable and the last thing I needed was him jumping out and running off with someone's kid. I would probably have to put the chain back on him.\nI threw the beef jerky at Cerberus' feet then spent the next fifteen minutes doctoring myself. I was going to have a nasty scar over my left eye to match the one on my right temple.\nAfter I put on a clean t-shirt I threw back the sports drink and waited a few minutes for the electrolytes to kick in. While I waited, I punched Mr. Benoit's address into my GPS system. A little dot began to flash on the screen.\nQuestion: What city is the man in?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

        "As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, one of the other places I didn\u2019t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around.\nLong Queue vs Online Tickets\nYou can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it\u2019s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don\u2019t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C\u2019est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here).\nFor some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there.\nOnline tickets cost quite a bit more (27\u20ac compared to 12\u20ac for adults and 10\u20ac for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5\u20ac.\nIt\u2019s a nice cool 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What is worth it?\nOptions:\n- visiting the catacombs\n- not enough information\n- buying tickets onsite\n- Online tickets",

        "Read the following context and answer the question.\nContext: It was a good feast. Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf. Instantly the thoughts of the crumbling villa, the torn furniture, and the diminishing coffers fled from her mind. Euphoria flowed in. She felt it in her fingers and toes.\nQuestion: How long was the feast probably lasted for?\nAnswer:",

        "My partner\u2019s parents decided to help with all the planning and set up for his sister\u2019s wedding. I am sure part of the reason was because they had offered to foot part of the expenses.\nThere came a point in the planning, when his mom seemed to sort of run-amok with her ideas. His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don\u2019t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways.\nOne of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.)\nSo imagine it\u2019s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people.\nMy partner\u2019s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn\u2019t even part of your ancestry. It\u2019s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don\u2019t really want.\nSoon after that, my partner\u2019s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister.\nI think the experience made us both content to elope.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: How will this person handle their own wedding?\nOptions:\n\nA. They will definitely have the tin keepsake box at their wedding.\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. They will gladly accept the help from the partner's parents.\n\nD.

        "Justin Nelson, Jr., pounded the last of the stakes of his new cattle pen into the dry dirt. Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done.\nHe took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself.\nUnder the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece. With a sigh escaping from the bellows of his withering chest, Justin shuffled back to the porch he had added onto his small two-room home. In the distance, a plume of dust was billowing off the road.

        "So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, \u201cIt says you have already played this role.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.\u201d She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back.

The actress playing \u201cmy\u201d role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent.

        "I started reading beauty blogs rather than magazines because I loved their honesty. With magazines, I was always a little suspicious that the review wasn't true, that it was more an advertorial than an honest article. Blogs seemed more honest - I never distrusted the review. Plus they went into so much more depth than magazines ever did. I think that the day I discovered beauty blogs was probably also the day my magazine addiction came to an end.\nBUT, there is one issue that I do have with blogs and that is editing, or grammar to be more precise. Now, don't get me wrong, it is not all blogs that I have this issue with. In fact, the majority of blogs I do read are very well written. But, I still come across a few that don't know the difference between your & you're; where, we're & were; and their, there & they're and this is a massive pet hate of mine. The odd typo doesn't bother me. We all make them. I know I do as I usually only proof read once but repeatedly writing there instead of their or where instead of were drives me mental. I just want to bust out a red pen and edit the post.\nThe carton below, which is floating around Facebook at the moment, was my inspiration for writing this post as it really highlights how, by making the slightest grammatical error, the entire meaning of the sentence changes.\nI suspect that, if you are a similar grammar fanatic, you are sitting here, nodding your head, thinking 'man, that drives me crazy, too!'. If you are not a grammar fanatic then you might be thinking 'hey, what are you whinging about - it is only a couple of letters out of order'. This is why it annoys me so much - I read a sentence but it doesn't quite make sense, so I have to go back and read it again to get an understanding. As soon as I start doing that, I am no longer reading the content of the post but am instead trying to decipher what is being written. As soon as I have stumbled over a few sentences I give up and stop reading.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What issue does the author find satisfactory about blogs?\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- It is precise and has suspicious review content\n- It requires proofreading\n- It is Habitual and honest",

        "SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA \u2014 North Korea human rights advocates are considering more practical ways to reform the repressive practices of the Kim Jong Un government, as denuclearization talks continue to end the country\u2019s economic and diplomatic isolation.\nRights activists hold out hope that U.S. President Donald Trump will confront Kim at their expected Singapore meeting in June about ongoing atrocities in North Korea, including a network of political prison camps and widespread government sanctioned abuses in the country.\nBenedict Rogers, with Christian Solidarity Worldwide, a religious freedom oriented organization, urges President Trump to emulate former President Ronald Reagan who once publicly called on the leader of the Soviet Union to tear down the Berlin Wall that separated democratic West Germany and the Communist East.\n\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s message should be, Mr. Kim if you seek peace, come to the gates of the prison camps, open the prison camps, tear down the walls of the prison camps,\u201d said Rogers at a North Korea human rights conference in Seoul on Thursday.\nIt is unclear if human rights will be part of the agenda at the U.S.-North Korea nuclear summit, if it happens. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and high-ranking North Korean official Kim Yong Chol have been meeting this week in New York to overcome the main obstacle to the summit; the gap between the U.S. demand for rapid and complete denuclearization and North Korea\u2019s more phased in approach that would provide early sanctions relief.\nBrad Adams, the Asia director at the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in a statement on Thursday, \u201cWhatever the outcome of nuclear talks, human rights-related sanctions should remain in effect until North Korea changes the way it treats its people.\u201d\nThe United Nations has passed 13 resolutions addressing human rights abuses in North Korea, most recently in March of this year at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: Who is urging Trump to try to be like Reagan in regards to fighting for religious freedoms?\nOptions:\n- Rogers\n- not enough information\n- Kim\n- Davis",

        "A school board in the eastern state of Virginia has filed an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to halt a ruling that allows a transgender student to use the boys\u2019 restroom next school year.\nThe Gloucester County School Board is trying to prevent Gavin Grimm from using the bathroom that matches his gender identity when school resumes later this year, saying it will \"put parents' constitutional rights in jeopardy.''\nGrimm sued the school district last year for the right to use the boys\u2019 restroom after the school board enacted a policy limiting bathroom use to the one corresponding with a person\u2019s biological sex rather than the gender with which the student identifies.\nGrimm was born female but identifies as male.\n\"Depriving parents of any say over whether their children should be exposed to members of the opposite biological sex, possibly in a state of full or complete undress, in intimate settings deprives parents of their right to direct the education and upbringing of their children,'' attorneys for the school board wrote.\nThe ACLU, which is defending Grimm, has argued that forcing him to use the girls' bathroom is a violation of Title IX and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\nThe issue is one that has been hotly debated in schools, courts and state legislatures across the U.S.\nThe Obama administration in May directed the nation\u2019s public schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identity or risk losing their federal funding. Twenty-one states have sued to overturn the directive.\nThe 4th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Grimm in April. The court reinstated Grimm's Title IX claim and sent it back to the district court for further consideration.\nThe school board wants the Supreme Court to put Grimm's district court case on hold until the justices decide whether to review the appeals court decision. The board says it plans to file its petition for Supreme Court review by late August.\nWhat does Gavin Grimm probably think about his case\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB.

        "One of the more surprising objects in the Getty Villa\u2019s newly reinstalled gallery of later Roman sculpture is a marble bust of a youth leaning out of a circular frame, mounted high on the gallery wall. J. Paul Getty originally acquired this particular sculpture in 1973, but it has been off view for many years. The recent reinstallation of the Getty Museum\u2019s antiquities collection at the Villa provided the opportunity to resurrect many such objects from storage and put them on display.\nBringing this strange object back to the public eye enabled us to ask\u2014and answer\u2014several questions about it. Who\u2014if anyone\u2014does it represent? When was it carved? Where was it made, and how did it end up in Los Angeles? In preparation for its display, we researched and reinterpreted the object, exploring both its ancient function and modern history.\nIn its new display, this object is fittingly surrounded by other examples of late Roman sculpture from the third and fourth centuries. Its inclusion in this gallery was not always a given, however, as the figure was long misidentified as a portrait of young Caracalla, who at ten years old became joint emperor with his father in A.D. 198.(1) But recent scholarship questioned the Caracalla identification and the object\u2019s date, suggesting it was carved at least a hundred years later.(2) In light of this research, curator Jens Daehner pushed to reexamine the sculpture and consider including it in the reinstallation.\nIn early 2015, the Antiquities Department brought this tondo and many other potential objects for the new galleries out of storage for viewing, providing curators, conservators, mount makers, preps, and registrars a chance to approve and prepare artworks for possible display.\nAfter the storage viewing and subsequent research, we updated the object record to conform with what scholars had suggested: this is not a second-century portrait of Caracalla but a fourth-century bust of a youth or divinity.

However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact.\nMost recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third.\nThe main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits.

But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex \u2014 not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy.\nI often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.

Though none of the tariffs have taken effect, it's the latest posturing in a trade dispute that some fear could escalate into a trade war.\nFor decades, Trump has complained about China's trade practices. One of his main complaints is what he calls Beijing's theft of U.S. intellectual property.\nLast month, Trump cited IP theft as justification for his proposed tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods. China retaliated by threatening its own tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods. Trump then escalated the dispute, saying he would consider tripling the amount of goods to which tariffs would be applied.\nChina gains access to U.S. technology by employing several tactics, which many observers have said are unfair or illegal.\nBeijing has long required that U.S. businesses transfer technology to Chinese companies as a precondition of entering the Chinese market. For instance, if you are a U.S. carmaker who wants to sell automobiles to China, Beijing requires that you team up with a local Chinese company, or face steep tariffs on imported vehicles.\n\nIn other cases, China requires U.S. companies to comply with localization requirements by storing sensitive data in the Chinese mainland. That increases the risk of intellectual property theft through means such as cyberattacks.It's difficult to quantify the value of technological knowledge. But according to an estimate last month by the U.S. trade representative, Chinese theft of American intellectual property costs between $225 billion and $600 billion every year.\nThat rate is unsustainable, said top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow. \"We can't afford to give up our technology,\" Kudlow said Friday. \"When they steal our technology ... they're stealing the guts of our American future.\"\nThe Chinese government has always denied carrying out the cyberattacks that frequently...\nQuestion: What does Kudlow probably believe\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- the US should delay enacting tariffs\n- the US has enough tariffs in place already\n- the US is justified in enacting tariffs",

Very, very quickly, absolutely.\"\n\"We're going to denuke North Korea,\" Trump also told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren, adding that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announcing one concession long-sought by North Korea not included in the document signed earlier in the day.\n\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\" he said, referring to the U.S. participation in joint military exercises with South Korea. At his news conference, Trump said the war games were expensive, provocative and inappropriate.\n\u200bLater, a Pentagon spokesman said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was \"not surprised\" by Trump's concession ending the war games and had been consulted, including discussions with Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\"We welcome the outcomes,\" the defense spokesman said. \"We support them.\"\nTrump struck an optimistic tone about his talks with Kim. \"My meeting with Chairman Kim was honest, direct and productive. We got to know each other well in a very confined period of time.\"\nThe U.S. leader stressed that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \"are no longer a factor.\"\nHow long did the summit between the two leaders last?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. several hours\n\nC. a few days\n\nD. several weeks",

        "New sexual harassment and racial discrimination lawsuits are rocking the already scandal riddled Fox News Channel.\nThree new lawsuits were filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Two allege racial harassment at Fox News, while a third alleges sexual harassment at Fox News Radio.\nThe cases increase to 23 the number of past or present Fox employees represented by attorney Doug Wigdor, the majority having cases alleging racial hostility by a since-fired financial executive. Fox said Monday that the lawsuits have no legal basis.\nKathleen Lee, a Fox News Radio employee of more than 10 years, alleges that radio anchor Ron Flatter subjected her to \u201cunrelenting sexual harassment\u201d after the network hired him in 2013.\nA former Fox employee, Adasa Blanco, said she alerted Fox executives about racially hostile behavior on the part of former Fox controller Judith Slater more than eight years before the executive was let go. Slater has denied charges of racially hostile conduct. Blanco, who is Hispanic, said that Slater made fun of her accent.\nIn the lawsuit, Wigdor said Fox \u201cknowingly harbored and protected\u201d a racist employee for more than eight years and misrepresented to the public that it fired Slater quickly upon learning of her behavior.\nNaima Farrow, another former Fox employee who worked for Slater, said she was fired without warning or explanation in 2015, less than three days after telling superiors she was pregnant. Farrow, who is black, said Slater mockingly referred to her as \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d\nFox News said in a statement that it is committed to a diverse workplace free from discrimination, and takes any complaint seriously. In these cases, Fox \u201ctook prompt, effective and, when necessary, strong remedial action,\u201d the network said. \u201cWe believe these latest claims are without legal basis and look forward to proving that the company at all times has acted appropriately, and lawfully, in connection with these matters.\u201d\nThe new legal claims come as Fox News is battling a series of...\nWhy is Fox News battling numerous lawsuits?\n- racial discrimination\n- not enough information\n- sexual harassment claims\n- gender discrimination",

        "Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean.\nSo far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless.\nOne of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn\u2019t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I\u2019ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls.\nFor the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better.\nPrior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don\u2019t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I\u2019ve washed it. I have tried the \u2018reverse poo\u2019 method which helps a bit \u2013 this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second \u2013 but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What kind of scent does the Rescue shampoo and conditioner have?\nOptions:\n\nA. Almond\n\nB. No smell\n\nC. Lovely scent\n\nD. not enough information",

Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows:\nHow would you define creativity?\nWhat does it mean to you to be an artist?\nDo you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy?\nChange and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography.\nYou seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like \u201cDark Matter\u201d, \u201cTouching Infinity\u201d, \u201cWe are made of Stars\u201d, \u201cRising tides\u201d and \u201cA drop in the ocean\u201d or \u201cAlchemy\u201d. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences?\nWhat continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist?\nWe both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire\u2019s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire\u2019s practice. After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September. Hopefully if all goes well we will both have an artist portrait that lives up to our expectations.\nQuestion: What happened after the author sent Claire a list of potential questions?\nOptions:\n\nA. Claire said she would answer them later\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. they reduced the number of questions down to six\n\nD. Claire answered all of them",

It literally was like the movie Animal House\nNow these 2 friends (let's call them Bill and Ted) were a little dorky compared to the rest of the other guys. We all played sports in high school and college and they were more like bookworms. Borderline alcoholics but bookworms. They were really awkward around girls but funny as hell around guys.\nLong story short. Both of them got involved into serious relationships after college and ended up marrying these girls. One girl was this born again Christian who vowed to cleanse Bill from his evil ways. Bill was so far removed from his friends (the wolfpack!) that he didn't even invite us to his wedding. It's been maybe 14-15 yrs now and I have no clue what he's doing. I think one of my friends did attend the wedding but it was only because they desperately needed a groomsmen.\nTed married this girl who seemed cool at first but after marriage, he stopped coming to any and all get togethers. He always had an excuse. He ended up moving a few hrs away and eventually just stopped responding to us. He did show up to a mutual friend's wedding maybe 3 yrs ago. He has a baby now but he's alot different than how he used to be.\nOther than Bill and Ted, all my other friends got married and have pretty normal marriages.

Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand.\nIt was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been.\nPerhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right?\nThe living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them.\n\"I hear that you are unhappy,\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more.\nConflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings. People liked to be listened to. The illusion of having a voice was almost as good as actually having one. Isn't that why people still bothered to go to the polls on election day and vote?\nAnd it worked on most people.

        "There\u2019s a story in my Tuscan family of nobility and forbidden love. It\u2019s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy\u2019s southern heel and involves my daughter\u2019s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco\u2019s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family\u2019s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners.\nOne day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. \u201cHe was no adonis,\u201d noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed.\nWhen Anna\u2019s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter\u2019s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto \u2014 Mario, Marco\u2019s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War \u2014 but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work.\nNonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as \u201csugo di nonna Anna\u201d and, oddly, \u201camatriciana\u201d (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta).\nBut these polpette \u2013 plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia \u2013 were passed down to Anna\u2019s daughter in law, Angela\u2019s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,...\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What did Nicola do for work in Torino?\nOptions:\n\nA.

This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home!\nThere are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I\u2019ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it\u2019s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include \u2018drawing oils\u2019 that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.\nQuestion: The author is probably very busy\nOptions:\n\nA. creating products\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. traveling to Australia\n\nD. caring for her baby\n\n===\nThe correct answer is",

She hated my tattoos, the way I would get into a heated debate one day with a police officer patron, then have a fantastic conversation with him days later about legalizing marijuana. She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me.\nBully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day. I honestly never had a clue she didn't like me. She was intense and sarcastic with everyone. I liked her style.\nOn this day, I really got the feeling they were trash talking me pretty hard, the way they kept disappearing, talking over me, laughing like mean girls. I blew it off, because I was down an internet rabbit hole, trying to wrap my brain around some concepts.\nI was looking at a word, and while I like to think I know exact definitions, sometimes I ask people their take on it. Many psychological terms have some subjective meaning.\nI spun around in my chair, locked eyes with #2, and asked her:\n\u201cWhat do you know about Machiavellianism?\u201d\nI swear to God, all I wanted was her take on it (she's a smart cookie), and all hell broke loose. I now realize that she thought I was passive-aggressively accusing her of said word. They got really nasty (behind my back, of course). They retreated to the back for awhile, and left me by myself. Cue loud, mean girl laughter.\nWhen #1 resumed her post next to me at the front desk, I calmly told her, \u201cI'm cashing out, and leaving. I'm uncomfortable.\u201d\nAnd I did.\nIt was noon.

        "I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.\nQuestion: What did the engineer think about Fergus?\nOptions:\n- She liked him \n - not enough information \n - She hated him \n - He's a rule breaker\n===\nThe correct answer is",

        "Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own.\nI\u2019d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  \u2014 it\u2019s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination \u2014 and texture \u2014 wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results \u2014 absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness.\nBut when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I\u2019m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field\u2019s The Italian Baker.\nField recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I\u2019m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing \u2014 maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.\nHow long does it probably take to make columba?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. probably about 4 hours\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. probably about an hour or less\n\nD. probably about 2 days",

        "If you\u2019ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you\u2019re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the \u201ceighth wonder of the world.\u201d\nThe version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there\u2019s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice\u2019s major waterway.\nThe Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge.\nBeginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge\u2019s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge.\nAndrea Palladio\u2019s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte\u2019s.\nWhy was the wooden bridge replaced and not repaired?\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. because Venice decided on a more permanent and durable bridge\n\nC. because of Andrea Palladio\u2019s aesthetic design\n\nD. because of popularity of Venice",

        "The U.S. Supreme Court plunged into the politically messy issue of redrawing congressional and legislative districts Tuesday, in a case that could have profound implications for both major political parties for years to come.\nThe high court heard oral arguments in a case brought by Democratic voters in Wisconsin. They argued that a Republican redistricting plan for the state assembly was so overtly partisan that it violated constitutional protections of freedom of speech and equal protection under the law for Wisconsin voters.\nA lower federal court sided with the challengers last year and against Republican state officials in Wisconsin. Officials argued Tuesday that they had not violated any constitutional rights when they drew up new boundaries for state assembly districts. \"Our legislature followed traditional redistricting criteria, which is what they have been required to do and we think they followed that and that the justices will agree,\" Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel told reporters in front of the court following the oral arguments.\nThe process of state legislatures redrawing congressional and legislative district boundaries has been enmeshed in politics for two centuries. Early on, the process was referred to as \u201cgerrymandering,\u201d where one party or the other tries to gain an electoral advantage by redrawing district boundaries to maximize their voting clout.\nRepublicans have had success in several states in redrawing congressional and legislative voting districts and that has helped them maintain their majority in the House of Representatives.

A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words!\nQuestion: Patch will probably eat:\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. an acorn\n\nC. the ice\n\nD. bits of newspaper",

Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's.\nOf course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint.\nDr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron.\nAnd so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.\nThe result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts.

        "As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \"outdated and unduly harsh\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country\u2019s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world.\nLast Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations \u2014 more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases.\nIt's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014.\nHowever in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs.\nFailing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders.\nUnder the Constitution, the president has the power to grant \u201cpardons for offenses against the United States\u201d or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction.\nThe American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nHow long did the vote take for the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015?",

Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes.\nThe teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018.\nThe Getty\u2019s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning?\nTo address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2)\nThe Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems.\nWhat was the name of one of the students?\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB.

        "One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources.\nSomething I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing.\nAn effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap.\nWhile at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits:\n* Direction \u2013 one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle.\n* Documented commitments are more effective \u2013 a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project.\n* Feeling of success \u2013 regularly revisiting a roadmap and...\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nWhat is probably true about the narrator?",

This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \"short-fingered vulgarian.\"\nSo, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988\u2014what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for $1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks\u2014Donald included.\nThe magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for $0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen\u2014including Donald Trump\u2014deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks.\nThen they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for $0.13.

What was the situation and what did you do or say?\u201d\nAs senior members of a Boy Scout Troop, other adults and I had to instruct two younger member on how to recognize and control emotions in the context of conflict. These two guys had a history of conflicts and I knew people won\u2019t always be present to control them.

Immediately I rushed in and yelled, \u201cSTOP! DROP IT, NOW!\u201d He immediately dropped the knife, sat down, and began crying.\nWhat happens after that is irrelevant. Perhaps it\u2019s due to my quiet nature and sudden outburst that produced the shock effect.

The long talk comes when the immediate conflict is temporarily resolved.\n* IMPORTANT NOTE: This incident is not a reflection on the Boy Scout of America, its spirit, or the use of such tools.

The Crew's house by the cemetery was less than half a mile from where they'd last seen Winston. Walking, it might've taken ten minutes to get there, but on Chloe's Vespa it was a hair-raising three-minute ride away. When they got there, Paul saw no sign of either Winston or Lily, so he assumed they were still inside the rundown shack that passed for a gallery. They parked a block away and approached at a brisk walk, Paul almost jogging to keep up with Chloe's excited strides.\nWinston was Chloe's mentor in what they referred to as \"The Life,\" this being a euphemism for a whole range of different activities, groups and lifestyles that fell under the general category of living underground and off the information grid. Paul, after defrauding his former partners and then running afoul of the law in a very public way, had been living The Life for almost a year and a half now. Chloe, as near as he could tell, had been doing it for almost a decade. Winston had started in the late '60s as a 16-year-old member of the notorious Weather Underground. He not only led his own Crew, he was also in contact with dozens, maybe scores of other such groups all over the world, including Chloe and Paul's little Crew of four. On top of all that, he'd once taken a couple bullets while helping Paul out, so, like Chloe, Paul had a soft spot in his heart for the old man.\nThey hadn't seen him since that bloody night, but Chloe had been in communication with him off and on over the last sixteen months. Winston and his Crew were old school and didn't trust much in the way of electronic communications. Mostly it had been encoded, hand-delivered letters and arcane classified ads in various newspapers. Chloe found this particular breed of paranoia on Winston's part annoying, but Paul admired it.\nQuestion: Chloe has been living The Life since\nAnswer:",

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my \u201cbucket list\u201d places \u2013 one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it\u2019s just not my cup of tea.\nFor one thing, I\u2019m not a gambler, like at all. I don\u2019t have anything against it, I just don\u2019t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad \u2013 in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs.\nI wondered how many people do similar things \u2013 gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it\u2019s all OK, but I can\u2019t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that\u2019s for her to decide, not me.\n\nThe juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad.

Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in \u201cthe real world\u201d (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here \u2013 I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting \u2013 was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work?

Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda?\nBecause of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments).

Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness.

Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die.\nAs the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power.\nAt the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop.

It reminded me of Pellegrino Artusi\u2019s potato gnocchi recipe in his famous cookbook from 1891, where he interrupts the recipe instructions to mention a signora who, upon attempting to stir the gnocchi cooking in the pot, finds they have disappeared \u2013 O dove\u2019erano andati? \u201cWhere did they go?\u201d\nIn the case of the gnocchi, there was too little flour used, according to Artusi. But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors \u2014 was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use \u201cproper\u201d ricotta? Aha.\n\u201cProper\u201d ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives. All my recipe testers had used the second kind \u2014 to be fair, some were new to the idea of buying ricotta and in their neighbourhood only had access to this. In that case, it would have probably been better to make your own, or choose another recipe.\nQuestion: Why is the right type of ricotta necessary when making gnudi?\nOptions:\n- It needs to not have a solid consistency when being used for this recipe\n- It needs to have the right structure with the right additives\n- It needs to have the right structure with no additives\n- not enough information",

But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me.\nI sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room.

Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \"guests\"; their families were \"guests\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness.

But it can certainly be a heck of a lot of fun. During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set. My means of entry was secured. Now I needed material. For me, the only good fish is a live one. Even though I hale from NB, I really don't like free-swimming seafood.

Each nuclear test conducted at the site was progressively more powerful, with the first bomb detonated in 2006 producing an estimated 1-2 kiloton yield, much less powerful than the 16-kiloton bomb the United States used on Hiroshima during World War II, and the last test in 2017 producing close to a 250-kiloton yield.\nThere were reports that the last nuclear test in September of 2017 triggered a tunnel collapse rendering the site unusable, but analysts say there were still two other tunnels that could be used for future tests.\nEarlier this year North Korean leader Kim Jong Un...\nWhat is probably true about Trump?\n\nA.

I\u2019m gradually trying to replace all of my old skincare and bodycare products with natural alternatives so that my body comes into contact with less parabens and other nasty chemicals.\nOne of the types of products which seems to be very late to the natural table is deodorant, there isn\u2019t a wide variety of paraben-free products available yet but I was really pleased to see that Soft & Gentle, a well-known household brand, had brought out this new 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant.

The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020.

A question on citizenship is a reasonable, commonsense addition to the census,\" Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement Tuesday.\nBut Democrats said the question would have the opposite effect \u2014 discouraging undocumented immigrants and citizen family members from responding to the census, undermining the accuracy of the results.\n\"We cannot accept an incomplete or unfair count in 2020 \u2014 too much is at stake,\" Rep.

Free soft drinks and popcorn. Live band. Five bucks to get in. Only twenty-five cents for arcade games. Sounded pretty cool for kids.

        "Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own.\nI\u2019d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  \u2014 it\u2019s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination \u2014 and texture \u2014 wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results \u2014 absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness.\nBut when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I\u2019m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field\u2019s The Italian Baker.\nField recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I\u2019m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing \u2014 maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.\nWhy do young girls make colomba?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- not enough information\n- To get out of sticky situations\n- For tradition\n- For Easter",

That compares to a total of 296,409, as previously reported.\n\"SIGAR receives all of the (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) personnel strength numbers published in the quarterly report from USFOR-A and has no means of independently verifying them,\" the statement added.\nThe new figures still amount to a sharp decline.\nAfghan forces suffered unprecedented casualties in 2017, reportedly losing about 10,000 personnel, according to reports. SIGAR has been unable to publicly disclose the exact number of Afghan forces killed, because that information continues to be classified by Washington and Kabul. The violence has led to increased reports of Afghan military desertions, but that information too has been classified.\nSenior U.S. military officials repeatedly have acknowledged the nearly 17-year-old conflict remains a stalemate, even while touting some successes under the new strategy announced by President Donald Trump in August.\nThose success include the increasing capability of the Afghan military, which began conducting airstrikes two years ago. The Afghan air force carries out between four to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense.\nBut the Kabul government controls just over half of the country's districts, SIGAR says.\nTrump's strategy appeared to commit the U.S. to Afghanistan indefinitely. It involves pressuring Pakistan to end its support for Afghan militants, supporting Kabul's effort to engage the Taliban in peace talks, and dropping more bombs on the country.\nThe U.S.-led...\nQuestion: After the Pentagon released the corrected figures on the decline in forces, SIGAR officials probably felt that:\nAnswer:",

        "I picked up this Sporf in Amsterdam Schipol airport. A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \"three-in-one\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \"sporf\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design.\nThe sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork.\nIn strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year.\nIt is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.\nQuestion: Why was the author unhappy with the sporf design?\nOptions:\n- because certain parts couldn't be used at the same time \n - because he wanted a better designed tool \n - because he preferred ordinary utensils \n - not enough information\n===\nThe correct answer is",

Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry.\nApparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam.\nPete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block.

        "It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus. When we met him, he must have been in his forties but looked to us adolescents to be older than Father Time. He was immediately dubbed 'Grandpa Munster'. With the tender sensitivity of males of our age, we didn't bother to hide this from him and he took it in good humour. In point of fact, Locutus was a great Don; firm when he needed to be and understanding and helpful as appropriate. You crossed this guy at your peril, but he was generally pretty tolerant.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What is probably true about Locutus?\nOptions:\n- He treats the residences unfairly.\n- He starts lots of fights with the residences.\n- not enough information\n- He is a responsible and caring Don.",

The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation.\nMy days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week.\nAnd with that, The Friday Thing was born.\nTo promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media. Clearly we had tapped into a seam of strong feeling among the nation's overworked...\nQuestion: How does Clare know Rhys Jones?\nOptions:\n- They are friends\n- not enough information\n- They are acquaintances\n- They are coworkers",

All to no avail.\nFinally, I\u2019d had enough and decided I had better things to do. I pulled the plug and unfriended Scott.

        "It was a dream, then a place, then a memory. My father built it near the Suwannee River. I like to think it was in the heart of Florida, because it was, and is, in my heart. Its name was Dogland. Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes. And then Grandma Bette wouldn't say a word for half an hour or more, a very long time for Grandma Bette to be quiet.\nGrandma Bette made a face because?\n- Because the Nixed were Black Dutch\n- The Nixes were indentured servants\n- The  narrator's father could not possibly know their ancestral history\n- not enough information",

History is not on his side. Midterms are typically unkind to the president's party, which on average loses about 30 House seats and a handful of Senate seats.\nThe losses are worse if the president's approval rating is below 50 percent, which could be the case this year. Trump's approval rating has ticked up in recent weeks, but the average has him just above 40 percent, not a strong position with a midterm looming.\n\"You know, you have a very unpopular president. And if Democrats take a broad path, they should win lots and lots of seats,\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a center-left advocacy and research organization.\nGallup has noted historically that presidents with an approval rating above 50 percent lose an average of 14 House seats in midterms, while those below 40 percent can expect to lose about 36 seats. Democrats need to gain 24 seats in the House and two seats in the Senate to regain the majority in both chambers.\nQuestion: What happened before/after/while Trump's Paris trip?\nAnswer:",

No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands.\nIt was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary.\nPatch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day.\nEventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel.\n\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\" Patch shouted up.\n\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.\nQuestion: Why did Patch shout at the bluejay?\nAnswer:",

Before my relationship there were certain boys in my life that I would meet and I would be able to tell straight away whether or not they were going to be a decent partner. I find that I am not attracted to the pretty boy, who loves himself, I go for the more reserved and shy people that I know will treat me right.\nOne time there was this guy back at school who I knew was all over the girls and that didn't want a relationship. He was rude to the teachers and a bit of a bad boy and all the girls swooned over him. I on the other hand was not, at one point he managed to get my number and was texting me. We spoke for a bit but once he started asking me for pictures of myself I stopped the contact, I knew he wasn't to be trusted from the beginning and decided he wasn't right for me. Then it was quite funny how one day we had a class where the rooms were next to each other and in between was a printer that both classes shared. I went to the room to print my work, and he was there waiting also. He asked me for a hug and just raised an eyebrow, then I saw my work had printed so I lent over to grab it and he thought I was going in for the hug. So he shut his eyes and held out his arms only to open them to see me walking off with my paper.

It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s.\nMy family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses.\nMy dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between.\nIt was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed.\nAs I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway.\nSome people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools.\nI remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether.\nI don\u2019t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn\u2019t do a good job.\nLater in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing.\nI still remember hating shoveling snow.

A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset.\nPaul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there.

        "Thanksgiving will be here before we know it! If you\u2019re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I\u2019d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you\u2019ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You\u2019ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for!\nI thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin.\nIt\u2019s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you\u2019re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions.\nIf you made these decorative pumpkins, and don\u2019t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We\u2019re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house.\nThe following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you\u2019d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion.\nWhy did the author create the thankful pumpkin?\n\nA. The author's niece and nephew had a spare pumpkin\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. The author was bored\n\nD. The author wanted to have a quality family discussion",

        "I\u2019ll go one farther back than that. I almost never had a first date. A young lady I met in the hospital cafeteria where I worked as a pharmacy intern (she was an X-ray tech) I asked out on a date. Would you like to follow me home? she asked. I said SURE!\nShe got in her car, hit the freeway, went over the top of the hill..and was gone. I went 75 mph desperately trying to keep her tail lights in my line of sight while swerving in and out of traffic. I thought if you don\u2019t really want to go out with me, just tell me, don\u2019t try to ditch me! I finally caught up with her but found out she always drives that way. If Janet Guthrie wasn\u2019t the first woman to drive in the Indy 500, she would have been.\nOver the years as she got older, collecting speeding tickets got old so she became a more responsible driver. I\u2019m glad, because I had to help pay for those tickets over the last 30+ years we\u2019ve been married. Glad I caught up to her that one night on the freeway.\nEDIT, AND BACKSTORY:\nShe ate lunch with her X-ray tech coworkers. She left the table first and I approached the others and asked what was her name, the girl that just left. They told me, and about a half hour later called the radiology department from the pharmacy phone and asked for her.\nShe said all the girls in the department were huddled around the phone and giggling while we talked. It\u2019s the handsome blonde intern in the pharmacy, they told each other. Oh, you mean THAT one?! Ooooh!

He was 86.\nIn a statement, Carter called Brzezinski \u201ca superb public servant\u201d as well as \u201cbrilliant, dedicated and loyal.\u201d Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F.

        "It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands.\nIt was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary.\nPatch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day.\nEventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel.\n\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\" Patch shouted up.\n\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.\nQuestion: What kind of animal is Patch?\nOptions:\n\nA. a robin.\n\nB. a squirrel\n\nC. not enough information\n\nD. a bluejay\n\n===\nThe correct answer is",

Nobody talked about her; I wondered how this fellow had even heard about her. \"Ain't a fiddle, though.

        "The Trump administration's decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census divided Capitol Hill on Tuesday, with Democrats saying the addition could skew the results and alter millions in government funding, while some Republicans praised it as a \"commonsense\" move.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday.\nIn a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted.\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department.\n\"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy. A question on citizenship is a reasonable, commonsense addition to the census,\" Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement Tuesday.\nBut Democrats said the question would have the opposite effect \u2014 discouraging undocumented immigrants and citizen family members from responding to the census, undermining the accuracy of the results.\n\"We cannot accept an incomplete or unfair count in 2020 \u2014 too much is at stake,\" Rep.

They were part of a relatively new Key West tradition called the Booty Hunt - a glorified bar crawl where participants followed a \"treasure map\" that led them from bar to bar, with occasional stops in private homes, and where the chief treasure to be found was the pleasure of being surrounded by fellow drunks and saying \"Arrrr\" a lot.

It was still early - just an hour or so after sunset, and Crooked Pete's was only half full. Located on Simonton, a block off the tourist-choked sidewalks of Duval Street, the bar hadn't hit its stride for the evening yet.

        "Read the following context and answer the question.\nContext: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and \u201cAwful Awfuls\u201d at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes.\nOne day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order.\n\u201cHi, How are you today?\u201d, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. \u201cWhat may I get you?\u2026..\u201d Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head.\nNext thing I know, I\u2019m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room!\nThe ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of \u201csyncope, unknown origin\u201d. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill!\nHere\u2019s the Garden City location, where I worked.\nQuestion: What did the waitress drink in the kitchen?\nAnswer:",

I knew that my daughter\u2019s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn\u2019t tell my daughter because I didn\u2019t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred. I thanked her for the 14 years she had been one of my daughter\u2019s closest companions and I held her as she took her last breath. I was afraid my daughter was going to be angry with me when I told her that i made the decision with out giving her time to say goodbye. She was sad but understood that I did the kindest thing I could have done for her kitty.\nQuestion: What motivated the mother's actions?\nAnswer:",

        "The U.S. Supreme Court plunged into the politically messy issue of redrawing congressional and legislative districts Tuesday, in a case that could have profound implications for both major political parties for years to come.\nThe high court heard oral arguments in a case brought by Democratic voters in Wisconsin. They argued that a Republican redistricting plan for the state assembly was so overtly partisan that it violated constitutional protections of freedom of speech and equal protection under the law for Wisconsin voters.\nA lower federal court sided with the challengers last year and against Republican state officials in Wisconsin. Officials argued Tuesday that they had not violated any constitutional rights when they drew up new boundaries for state assembly districts. \"Our legislature followed traditional redistricting criteria, which is what they have been required to do and we think they followed that and that the justices will agree,\" Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel told reporters in front of the court following the oral arguments.\nThe process of state legislatures redrawing congressional and legislative district boundaries has been enmeshed in politics for two centuries. Early on, the process was referred to as \u201cgerrymandering,\u201d where one party or the other tries to gain an electoral advantage by redrawing district boundaries to maximize their voting clout.\nRepublicans have had success in several states in redrawing congressional and legislative voting districts and that has helped them maintain their majority in the House of Representatives. Democrats have come under fire as well for partisan maps in states where they control the legislature, like Maryland and Massachusetts.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments, the more liberal high court justices seemed open to the case brought by Democratic voters.

In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot.\nDemocrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country.\nIn New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president.\n\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally.\nIn Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration.

        "The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it\u2019s because they\u2019re just so easy to use. I\u2019ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let\u2019s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces\u2026.\nAlthough the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different \u2013 MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here.\nMAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil \u2013 this is the first lip pencil that I\u2019ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I\u2019m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it\u2019s not sticky.\nThe colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a \u2018soft plum with pearl\u2019. It\u2019s definitely a plummy shade, although I can\u2019t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it\u2019s very sheer it appears much more natural once it\u2019s on the lips. It\u2019s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you\u2019re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm!\nThe crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it\u2019s quick and easy, and as it\u2019s very light and sheer it\u2019s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply.\nQuestion: What happened when the narrator tried on the MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil?\nOptions:\n\nA.

        "I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.\nQuestion: Where did the president go on to greener fields?\nOptions:\n\nA.

When I was in middle school, if you didn\u2019t have homework completed or goofed off in some way, teachers could make you stay after school for \u2018after school help.\u2019 It was essentially a mandatory study hall and if a teacher called you out, you had no choice in the matter.\nNow, I was in Biology class towards end of my middle school career and was sitting at one of those lab tables next to another student. We both had newspaper routes (yes, people actually delivered actual newspapers to people\u2019s homes in the 1980s), so it would make us late for our deliveries if we were made to stay after school. This biology teacher would check our vocabulary assignment every week and I totally spaced it this week - Oh Crap! Now, my lab mate had most of his done, but just didn\u2019t quite finish.

He looks it over and says \u201cOK, good job\u201d or something like that. Scott is looking at me in utter disbelief. Even funnier was the fact that this week\u2019s assignment required 6\u20137 pages of paper to complete. The one I had blindly grabbed from folder had 2 pages, with barely anything in second page.

But the \u201cnice sweatshirt\u201d bit was what really got me.\nI wasn\u2019t even wearing my sweatshirt.\nSo.

        "Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair.\nTaken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to \u201cthe more the better\u201d.\nSo how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.\nBut the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The \u201crecreational athlete\u201d, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range.\nSo how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special \u201chigh protein\u201d training diet.\nSportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it\u2019s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone.\nThis has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that\u2019s before using any protein powders.\nBut protein supplements can\u2019t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule.\nWho has proven in their research the amount of protein men and women should have per day?\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB.

The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don\u2019t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the \u201cmonstrous peoples\u201d as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade.\nThis work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. \u201cScholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery.

The spokesman said the 39-year-old Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was \"inconsistent\" because she has at various times denied she had a sexual encounter with Trump, but now claims she is telling the truth that she met up with him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada.\nShah also dismissed Daniels' claim that in 2011, when she was on her way to a fitness class in Las Vegas with her infant daughter, she was approached by a stranger who threatened her.\n\"A guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,' \" Daniels told journalist Anderson Cooper. \"And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone.\"\nTrump has yet to comment directly on Daniels' story. However, he posted a Twitter comment Monday that seemed to allude to the controversy.\nDaniels says the Las Vegas incident occurred shortly after she first tried to sell her story about her encounter with Trump to a tabloid magazine. She said the incident made her fearful for years and that she thought she was doing the right thing when she accepted $130,000 from Trump...\nQuestion: What kind of car does Michael Cohen probably drive?\nOptions:\n- Ford\n- Chevy\n- not enough information\n- Honda",

        "It was a good feast. Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf. Instantly the thoughts of the crumbling villa, the torn furniture, and the diminishing coffers fled from her mind. Euphoria flowed in.

This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side.\nOne truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot.\nAt this point, I was parallel with the shooter\u2019s truck and only about 50\u201360 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, \u201cOh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!\u201d\nI floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could.\nWhile he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information.\nAs it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter.\nI was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction.\nI lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other \u201croad rage stories\u201d, but this is still the craziest one.\nQuestion: What is the driver's name?\nAnswer:",

When I was in middle school, if you didn\u2019t have homework completed or goofed off in some way, teachers could make you stay after school for \u2018after school help.\u2019 It was essentially a mandatory study hall and if a teacher called you out, you had no choice in the matter.\nNow, I was in Biology class towards end of my middle school career and was sitting at one of those lab tables next to another student. We both had newspaper routes (yes, people actually delivered actual newspapers to people\u2019s homes in the 1980s), so it would make us late for our deliveries if we were made to stay after school.

The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \"rapid response\" to highlight any \"misstatements\" or \"contradictions,\" Fox News reports.\nComey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \"bright white half-moons\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.\nComey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.\nTrump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians.\nThe firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation.

In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and \u201cAwful Awfuls\u201d at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes.\nOne day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order.\n\u201cHi, How are you today?\u201d, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. \u201cWhat may I get you?\u2026..\u201d Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head.\nNext thing I know, I\u2019m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall.

It is a waste of your time and money'...but I don't. I don't want to cause a scene, or start a barrage of backlash from people claiming that it worked for them. Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing.\nBefore I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary.\nWhy detoxes don't work\nFirstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies.\nI read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \"shining glory\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox.\nWhy did Reckitt Benckiser market that body hair is unsightly?\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. to educate Chinese women\n\nC. to help women be more healthy\n\nD. to sell more Veet",

While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed.\nEvery time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it.\nAnd even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases. And of course, let\u2019s not forget that heating food kills some of the nasty microbes that can cause food poisoning.\nThe principle behind a raw food diet is that cooking food destroys the natural enzymes and nutrients that would otherwise give us optimal health and control body weight. A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state.\nNow on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win. So that gets a big tick.\nUnquestionably, there are many benefits to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and fibre and low in kilojoules. But is raw superior to cooked? A review of 28 research studies found eaters of both cooked and raw vegetables had a lower risk of cancer compared to people who did not eat many vegetables in the first place.\nWhere the science gets murky is the claim that raw food is better because cooking destroys the enzymes found in plants. It is 100 percent correct that cooking will do this. But so too does digestion. Few enzymes survive their trip through the hydrochloric acid spa bath in the stomach. And those plant enzymes are essential only to the plants. The...\nQuestion: Why should a raw food diet be eaten?\nOptions:\n\nA. because it aids digestion\n\nB. because it provides many kilojoules\n\nC. because it lowers cancer risks\n\nD. not enough information",

        "President Donald Trump made a fresh appeal Friday for support to arm some teachers to help stem mass shootings targeting schools.\n\nTrump's pitch came during a speech before a friendly conservative crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) meeting near Washington.\n\nTrump spent much of the past week dealing with the aftermath of the tragic high school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Although a new experience for Trump, it is a situation many of his predecessors are all too familiar with.\nFormer Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all faced similar tragedies while in office. They also dealt with political pressures in the aftermath demanding action.\n\nTrump is also beginning to see why presidents are often frustrated when they try to bridge what pollsters and political pundits often refer to as the great divide over guns in the United States.\n\nIn the aftermath of the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999, President Clinton sought to calm the nation. \"We must do more to reach out to our children and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their conflicts with words, not weapons,\" he said.\n\nIn 2007, it was left to President Bush to lead the grieving at Virginia Tech after a gunman killed 32 people before committing suicide. \"May God bless and keep the souls of the lost, and may his love touch all of those who suffer in grief,\" he said at an on campus memorial service.\n\nAnd in 2012, an emotional President Obama wiped away a tear as he addressed the nation in the wake of the massacre of grade-school students in Newtown, Connecticut. \"We've endured too many of these tragedies in the last few years. The majority of those who died today were children, beautiful little kids between the ages of five and 10 years old,\" he said.\nTrump has expressed sympathy for the victims and families in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. But he has also been forceful in pushing for solutions, including the controversial idea of...\nQuestion: After the end of the story how did Obama feel after he addressed the nation about a grade-school tragedy?\nOptions:\n\nA. he left and didn't think about the situation again\n\nB. he fired more security officers to save money\n\nC. he became more empathetic to families who were victims of shootings\n\nD. not enough information\n\n===\nThe correct answer is",

That compares to a total of 296,409, as previously reported.\n\"SIGAR receives all of the (Afghan National Defense and Security Forces) personnel strength numbers published in the quarterly report from USFOR-A and has no means of independently verifying them,\" the statement added.\nThe new figures still amount to a sharp decline.\nAfghan forces suffered unprecedented casualties in 2017, reportedly losing about 10,000 personnel, according to reports. SIGAR has been unable to publicly disclose the exact number of Afghan forces killed, because that information continues to be classified by Washington and Kabul. The violence has led to increased reports of Afghan military desertions, but that information too has been classified.\nSenior U.S. military officials repeatedly have acknowledged the nearly 17-year-old conflict remains a stalemate, even while touting some successes under the new strategy announced by President Donald Trump in August.\nThose success include the increasing capability of the Afghan military, which began conducting airstrikes two years ago. The Afghan air force carries out between four to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense.\nBut the Kabul government controls just over half of the country's districts, SIGAR says.\nTrump's strategy appeared to commit the U.S. to Afghanistan indefinitely.

Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows:\nHow would you define creativity?\nWhat does it mean to you to be an artist?\nDo you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy?\nChange and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography.\nYou seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like \u201cDark Matter\u201d, \u201cTouching Infinity\u201d, \u201cWe are made of Stars\u201d, \u201cRising tides\u201d and \u201cA drop in the ocean\u201d or \u201cAlchemy\u201d.

After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September.

And her dream finally came true, thanks to the death of 74-year-old Porter Strickley.\nShe could not deny that she had learned the job well, working for that old pain-in-the-butt. He was 57 when she interviewed for the position of Assistant District Attorney. At the time, she thought he was 70.\nTwo months ago, she had become the District Attorney. She loved seeing her name on the door. And she felt a rush of adrenaline every time a judge referred to her as 'The District Attorney' in open court. The D.A.'s office would be better than ever--now that she was running the show.\nThere was a soft knock, and Andrea Newly opened the door just enough to peek in.\n\"Come in, Andrea.\" Angela sometimes wondered if she had made a mistake two weeks ago when she hired this timid young lady as her assistant. Angela had been impressed with her resume. But in person, Andrea was quiet, and seemed to be rather intimidated by Angela.\nBut Andrea was enthralled with every word Angela spoke. And the new D.A. couldn't resist the prospect of being god to her assistant. She had hired her on the spot, even though she knew Andrea would stress her patience.\nBut Angela was confident the 25-year-old could be molded into her mentor's image. And thereby, become a powerful force for justice in the D.A.'s office.\nAndrea took a chair across from the D.A. The furniture in the District Attorney's office was similar to that found in most old government offices-largely unchanged since the 1950s. Yet the hardwood chairs and desks were of such good quality that an exact replacement would be cost prohibitive in today's market. Angela planned to upsize her diminutive desk as soon as possible, even if the money came out of her own pocket.\nWhat did Angela want to change?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- Some 1950's furniture in her office\n- not enough information\n- Her timid assistant\n- Her lack of a love life",

        "The collaborative process between me and Claire Bridge has been good so far. Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows:\nHow would you define creativity?\nWhat does it mean to you to be an artist?\nDo you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy?\nChange and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography.\nYou seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like \u201cDark Matter\u201d, \u201cTouching Infinity\u201d, \u201cWe are made of Stars\u201d, \u201cRising tides\u201d and \u201cA drop in the ocean\u201d or \u201cAlchemy\u201d. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences?\nWhat continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist?\nWe both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire\u2019s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire\u2019s practice. After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September. Hopefully if all goes well we will both have an artist portrait that lives up to our expectations.\nWhy did the author and Claire need to whittle down the number of questions to six main ones?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- they began with too many questions\n- not enough information\n- the questions were repititive\n- Claire did not want to answer some questions",

They had been accused of espionage or trying to overthrow the government, charges widely seen as bogus.\nPyongyang has detained at least 16 Americans over the past two decades, often attempting to use them as bargaining chips. All were eventually released, although Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old college student, died shortly after returning to the United States last year.\nA White House statement Wednesday praised North Korea\u2019s latest prisoner release as a \u201cpositive gesture of goodwill\u201d ahead of the Trump-Kim summit, which is expected to take place as soon as next month.\nSouth Korea\u2019s presidential office said Pyongyang\u2019s decision was a \u201cvery positive\u201d sign for a successful North Korea-U.S. meeting.\n\nThe freeing of the prisoners coincided with a visit to Pyongyang by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who declined to say whether the release was a U.S. precondition for holding talks with the North.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that,\u201d Pompeo told reporters on the flight home. \u201cIt would have been more difficult [had the prisoners not been released]. ...

        "Shortly after five, the hospital called. More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \"one treatment episode every three months\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely).\nThe folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate.\nIn Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \"No Such Address\" or simply \"Return to Sender\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years.\nThus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit).\nNo one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable. It was fiscal suicide. The hospital was perfectly willing to let the local experts in deadbeats handle the workload.\nTonight, Ray could tell them no. He liked telling them no, especially when it was the truth.\nWhat is the hospital's \"one treatment episode every three months\" penalty is known as?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. insurance fraud\n\nB. the Black List\n\nC. not enough information\n\nD. chemical dependency",

        "Americans may become accustomed to the political turmoil swirling around President Donald Trump, but it remains an open question whether that turmoil will ultimately help or hurt Trump and his Republican allies, especially in an election year.\nLast week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania \u2014 a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections.\nThis week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe.\nTrump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe.\nEarlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \"assurances\" that firing Mueller was \"not even under consideration.\"\nThe latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\"\nThe tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy.\n\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\nThe renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes.\nHow does Trump feel about the Russian probe?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. He is disgusted\n\nB.

She hated my tattoos, the way I would get into a heated debate one day with a police officer patron, then have a fantastic conversation with him days later about legalizing marijuana. She hated that I was liked, but still could give fuck-all about what others thought of me.\nBully #2 was our financial director, who got stuck as the manager on duty that day. I honestly never had a clue she didn't like me. She was intense and sarcastic with everyone. I liked her style.\nOn this day, I really got the feeling they were trash talking me pretty hard, the way they kept disappearing, talking over me, laughing like mean girls. I blew it off, because I was down an internet rabbit hole, trying to wrap my brain around some concepts.\nI was looking at a word, and while I like to think I know exact definitions, sometimes I ask people their take on it. Many psychological terms have some subjective meaning.\nI spun around in my chair, locked eyes with #2, and asked her:\n\u201cWhat do you know about Machiavellianism?\u201d\nI swear to God, all I wanted was her take on it (she's a smart cookie), and all hell broke loose. I now realize that she thought I was passive-aggressively accusing her of said word. They got really nasty (behind my back, of course). They retreated to the back for awhile, and left me by myself. Cue loud, mean girl laughter.\nWhen #1 resumed her post next to me at the front desk, I calmly told her, \u201cI'm cashing out, and leaving. I'm uncomfortable.\u201d\nAnd I did.\nIt was noon.

Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop \u201cfalse and extortionist accusations\u201d about it.\nThe financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported.\nThat has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure.\nThe controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances \u2014 his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world.\nHere are six noteworthy takeaways from the report:\nGolf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to $210 million from nearly $300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than $20 million from $14 million.

The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits.\nThe majority of these studies agree on one thing \u2013 there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career.\nThe studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals \u2013 it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed.\nThe danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources.\nProfessional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level.\nPsychology Today tells us that \u201cBurnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly \u2013 often because of their \u201cI can do everything\u201d personalities, they rarely see it coming.\u201d\nStress is inevitable. How can everyone deal with stress?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- Trying to avoid it completely\n- Letting it become all-consuming\n- Focusing solely on career\n- not enough information",

They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh.

        "\"Hon? You still awake?\"\nQuiet.\nJan pulled herself out of the bed and stood up, looking around the dark room for anything. She needed something, something that she could grab onto, and hold, hold until it hurt, hold until blood made racing red lines down her arms, until her hands were raw. She left the room and walked quietly into the now guest room that had been Rob's. Opening the closet, she found the teddy bear that Rob had once confided in and held it in her arms tight as she slumped down on the bed. A quiet sobbing rang through the house accompanied only by the chime of the grandfather clock in the living room every fifteen minutes. As Jan lay on the guest room bed she soon resorted to deep gasps, knowing that meager tears would never be forceful enough to express her worry to those that listened. \"Just bring him home, bring him home, bring him home,\" she mumbled over and over, each time changing the tone slightly in a desperate attempt to make her pleading sound more real.\nShe could hear the occasional snore of her husband and she hated him for it. What kind of person could find sleep at a time like this? Why wasn't he awake worrying? Why wasn't he with her? Her thoughts became dark like blood, evil little monsters eating at her sanity. If her son was crazy and not just a drug addict she could see how easy it was to fall over the line. \"Please God, please God, please God, please Rob, Please Rob, Please Rob, Please Rob.\" Soon, a sleep came but it was peppered with demons. And as the sliver of sun peeked through the window, she held her false self-control tight and said little.\nHow long did Jan probably remain awake after going to bed?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- not enough information\n- not long after finding the teddy bear\n- several hours\n- not long after getting up out of bed",

        "Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget.  It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps.\nClean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet.\nSome of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating.\nA major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself.\nUse Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer\u2019s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer\u2019s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive.\nFor example:  you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall.  Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers.\nWhen you first start reading about clean eating, you may find \u201cexperts\u201d expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is \u2013 they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don\u2019t have to eat them just start a clean eating.\nIf you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don\u2019t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those \u2013 you will be doing just fine.\nQuestion: What does the author note is a key factor in selecting produce when practicing clean eating?\nOptions:\n- not enough information \n - try to choose produce in the \"super foods\" category \n - fresh produce is a better choice than canned or frozen produce \n - either is equally beneficial\n===\nThe correct answer is",

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there.\nI took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers.

They were about to kiss for the first time and then this: yellow gumballs.\nStan went to a group to try to accept that Sheila was gone. It was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind of surrealist moment. There is a group for everything in California.\nAfter several months of hard work on himself with the group, Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs.

It is the standard to live by and health professionals unanimously agree that by following this diet pyramid, your health will benefit tremendously.\nThe pyramid is a wonderful synopsis of what the Mediterranean Diet entails. It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed.\nThe pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region.\nOne of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways.\nThey are among the minority of the world\u2019s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic.\nThere are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) \u2013 plus a little red wine.\nYour fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily.\nFish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week. Red meat should only be consumed 3 to 4 times a month.

        "Once again, I've analysed my year of travel to see if I'm any closer to reducing it year on year. It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing.\nKey to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure.\nThe quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: Coaching probably lasts:\nOptions:\n- 1 hour\n- not enough information\n- 1 week\n- 1 month",

This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn\u2019t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers.\nI have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don\u2019t like this.\nI believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words.\nAs such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically \u201cit is my blog and I can run it how I like\u201c.\nThis is true: it is your blog, and you can run it how you like, but the true measure of a person is not just in what they say, but also in the conversation and discourse that follows.\nQuestion: What does the author think bloggers should do with negative comments?\nAnswer:",

        "Lanc\u00f4me Juicy Tubes changed my life.\nOk, well that\u2019s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I\u2019d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!).\nFast forward several (ahem\u2026) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there\u2019s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention \u2013 the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out \u2013 Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey.\nJuicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it\u2019s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses.\nShow Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it\u2019s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it\u2019s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.\nWhat types of oil did the author use on her lips?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. blueberry\n\nB. sweet almond and cranberry\n\nC. lemon and orange\n\nD. not enough information",

It is a journal of the chaos, delight, opportunities and travails that we encounter all rolled in with an obsession for photography (as far as my skillz extend) and a dash of humour (well, I try anyway).\nDRIVING IN AMERICA\nCovering 800 miles of American freeways in less than 10 days is something I never thought I\u2019d do to be honest \u2013 an inexperienced driver at best I\u2019ve driven short distances (and through a Florida tropical storm from Cape Canaveral back to our Orlando apartment) \u2013 but somehow we survived unscathed driving diagonally the length of Louisiana from New Orleans to Shreveport, through the crazy traffic of Dallas and along the long, undulating motorways of Texas.\nI\u2019ll be honest, and admit that did we encounter a couple of challenging and scary situations \u2013 a truck driver changing lanes not allowing me enough time to enter a motorway (I luckily just popped into a shoulder lane), getting lost in the middle of Dallas skyscrapers (we jammed every device we had onto navigation), accidentally assuming a road was much narrower than it really was (luckily the road was relatively quiet so I just guided her nimbly over to the correct lane) and dodging some of the twits who pulled out in front of us \u2013 one with a trailer full of wood \u2013 but overall it really was fine.\nCOMMUNICATING IN OTHER LANGUAGES\nYou\u2019ve decided where to go, booked the flight, found a hotel, decided what to do\u2026 and then you get to your destination.

In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot.\nDemocrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country.\nIn New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president.\n\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally.\nIn Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world.\n\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\" he said.\nPolitical analysts said Democratic enthusiasm and a focus on Trump were clearly on display in both states.\n\"We have heard for months and months about all this energy on the left. It had not materialized until tonight,\" said Steve Peoples of the Associated Press. \"A big night for Democrats and, really, it was a repudiation of sorts of the Trump nationalist message.\"\nEven some Republicans saw the results as a rejection of the Trump political brand.

The strange thing was to me, it wasn\u2019t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn\u2019t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn\u2019t lose weight.\nWhat I didn\u2019t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier.\nMy second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn\u2019t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason\u2026 Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down.\nI will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn.

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\"\"\nAt the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand?\nI thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career.\nBack in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage.\nThe premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers.\nOpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. \ud83d\ude42 )\nSo, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant.\nI took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...\nQuestion: Why were people in the Midlands seeking retraining?\nAnswer:",

Some even learned to thrive in her, building stone monuments to themselves and living their lives surrounded in the lavish luxuries of Gods. How puny their monuments were compared to the desert herself.\nWhere they had castles surrounded by dry moats, the desert had mountains surrounded by thousand year sandstorms. Where they had silks and the most beautiful slaves serving their every greatest desire, she had dunes that stretched for a thousand leagues and a sun that burned huge and deep crimson in the violet sky. Where desert kings, the Danken, dined on the finest food and drank the finest wine, the desert drank every drop of water from the air itself and feasted on men.\nKadin knew the desert. He knew her voice whispering in the dark of night like a dangerous lover. The sound he heard now was not her voice but a cry from one trapped within the desert's teeth. It was the cry of a woman.\nKadin rose from his makeshift bed in the dip of two dunes. He stood quickly, tying the leather straps of his knife belt around his waist. He pulled on his boots and silently mounted White Ash. THe mare felt his soft touch and made no sound.\nKadin listened and heard the cry again. He studied the dunes in the darkness of night. THe blood moon painted the desert a deep red. He felt the echos and turned White Ash towards their origin.

        "This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??).\nWhenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out.\nI have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now?\nQuestion: The narrator believes that\nOptions:\n\nA. Grey hair is bad\n\nB.

It comes at a time when he looks to turn around his often weak polls and bolster his political standing at home in advance of midterm congressional elections in November, where Democrats are poised to make gains.\nFrom the images of their historic first handshake to signing an agreement on denuclearization, Trump and Kim took the first steps toward writing a new chapter in relations between their two countries.\n\n\"People are going to be very impressed, people are going to be very happy, and we are going to take care of a very big and very dangerous problem for the world,\" Trump said sitting alongside Kim after both men signed the joint agreement.\nIt was Trump's biggest moment on the world stage, and an opportunity he was eager to seize.\n\n\"We got along really well.We had a great chemistry.You understand how I feel about chemistry.It is very important,\" Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren immediately after the summit. \"I mean, I know people where there is no chemistry. We had it right from the beginning. We talked about that and I think great things are going to happen for North Korea.\"\n\nIt was the first ever meeting between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader. The two men signed an agreement that committed both countries to work toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but the details remain vague.\n\nThe United States offered unspecified security guarantees and a halt to military exercises with South Korea.

        "I have always been a \u201chandyman\u201d involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle.\nWhen the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a \u201crage\u201d of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\" I said, \"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\"\nI learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it. But, if I hadn't been so angry I would never have attempted it at all. Life is full of little lessons. Pay attention to them and learn. If you have to lash out, lash at solving the situation you are in instead the person who caused it. It is significantly more productive that way.\nQuestion: What was the handyman attaching to the ceiling?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

        "I love going to the spa. Honestly, who doesn't. These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas.\nI had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage.  Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!).\nWhat will the in-laws think about getting the author in the future?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- a bag of hot stones\n- Something to help her carry the Crazy Kid and Kiki\n- another massage\n- not enough information",

We were living in an old house at the time and I was home alone with the youngest child (who was around six months old), balanced on my hip as I opened the door. The visitor looked genuine, dressed in the expected uniform. He was around 6.3 and probably not the most tidily presented utility man I'd met, but I believed him to be genuine and willingly invited him in out of the foul weather. It was pouring down outside, a freezing cold winter's day. As I closed the door I remembered that I should have asked to see his company I.D. , so as I opened the meter cupboard and switched on the light, I politely said, 'Oops, I should have asked to see your I.D. if you don't mind?. He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'.\nThere was an embarrassed silence. He continued to stare down at me without making a move for what seemed like minutes but was probably seconds. He didn't produce his I.D., instead he almost grudgingly read the meter as I looked on and then he swiftly left without saying goodbye. I closed the door and locked it, and then took a while to get my pulse rate back to normal and to realise I'd just learned a very big lesson.

I\u2019d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!).\nFast forward several (ahem\u2026) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there\u2019s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention \u2013 the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out \u2013 Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey.\nJuicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it\u2019s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses.\nShow Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it\u2019s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it\u2019s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.\nWhy does she like to wear lipgloss?\n- it's perfect\n- not enough information\n- natural color\n- to look really pared back",

As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it. My mouth was dry from breathing canned air and the carbonation burned like fire. Winslow, from the sheriff's office, sat down next to me. 'I appreciate this, Dan,' he said. 'No problem.' Sam Winslow and I had grown up together about twenty miles outside Austin in a little town called Coupland. We'd fought a lot as kids, and there were still plenty of differences in our politics and educations. But being on the police and fire rescue squad had brought me closer to him again, and I was glad of it. A private detective needs all the friends he can get. 'What do you make of it?' I asked him. 'Accidental drowning, looks like.' I raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. 'He's got a bump on the head that could have come off a rock. We'll see what the coroner says.' 'Any idea who he is?'

She looked just like she did most days back then--a glamour queen, a movie star (\"Just like Lena Horne,\" my friend Chloe had once said, \"only darker--oh, sorry, Leah!\"), but today her beauty somehow had a harder, more defiant edge to it. I could smell the expensive Dior perfume as soon as I opened the door, which surprised me, because my mom was usually fastidious about not getting perfume on her clothes. She was wearing her bug glasses--huge dark things with lenses that bulged out like fly eyes and reflected my face like a fun-house mirror. She had tied a yellow silk scarf around her hair and was taking deep pulls on a cigarette held between two immaculately manicured fingers.

The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn\u2019t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I\u2019ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls.\nFor the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better.\nPrior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don\u2019t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I\u2019ve washed it.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn\u2019t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers.\nIf you ever have a spare week, or ten, it\u2019s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/\u00a3millions.\nFor social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join \u201cnetworks\u201d and \u201ccommittees\u201d discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people \u2013 practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not.\nCentral to much of the impact is \u201caccess\u201d. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn\u2019t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out \u2013 and they knew him.

        "Every so often I see a scenario play out that I find rather disappointing.\nIt works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn\u2019t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers.\nI have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don\u2019t like this.\nI believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words.\nAs such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically \u201cit is my blog and I can run it how I like\u201c.\nThis is true: it is your blog, and you can run it how you like, but the true measure of a person is not just in what they say, but also in the conversation and discourse that follows.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: Why do some blog authors turn off comments on their post?\nOptions:\n\nA. because commenters spread false information\n\nB. because they don't like when readers disagree with them\n\nC. because they only want their views to be read\n\nD. not enough information",

        "In 1981, when I was nine years old, my father took me to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it \u2013 in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford\u2019s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I\u2019d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero.\nThat illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we \u201csee\u201d data.\nMy dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as \u201cpalaeobiologists\u201d \u2013 meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin\u2019s time, palaeontology \u2013 especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record \u2013 involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than \u201cstamp collecting\u201d.\nWhat did the author go with his father to see in the movies in 1981?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. Star Wars\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. Star Trek\n\nD. Raiders of the Lost Ark",

        "The sudden burst of spring produce in the market after a long, monotonous winter of cavolo nero and bright oranges is one of the things that constantly reminds me why I love living and eating in Italy. A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it\u2019s my first time walking through my local market.\nThere are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany\u2019s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren\u2019t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto.\nAnd then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid\u2019s hair than a monk\u2019s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn\u2019t such a common sight at the market in Florence. It still isn\u2019t, in that you won\u2019t get them by the crateful like you do fava beans and artichokes, though they\u2019re not particularly difficult to find now. They\u2019re just one of those special things that don\u2019t last long. Blink and you\u2019ll miss them, or come late to the market and they could easily be sold out. It\u2019s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course).\nIf you\u2019ve never tasted agretti before, it\u2019s worth seeking out if you\u2019re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu. Frances Mayes likens it to spinach, but notes that it is so much more, \u201cWhile agretti has the mineral sharpness of spinach, it tastes livelier, full of the energy...\nQuestion: How long was the narrator probably at the market?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

        "My mother's shopping lists were ordered by rules known only to her. As you slid your finger down the columns of groceries and toiletries, you would invariably be stopped by something along the lines of \"2dozjumHerbal Essences\" or \"1pepperoni TC,\" with the \"TC\" underlined twice and flanked by gnarled masses of pencil scratch-outs. When we were kids, we dreaded accompanying her to Wal-Mart, or worse, the Cosco at the edge of town, where the echoing rafters and limitless aisles seemed to mock the confusion into which we were inevitably thrown when handed torn-off fragments of the list. Of course, it was easy enough to see in hindsight that \"2dozjumHerbal Essences\" was merely the bastard child of two drunkenly weaving columns--we had been supposed to get two dozen jumbo eggs and a bottle of my mother's favourite brand of shampoo (ever inventive in creating proprietary abbreviations--\"TC\" standing for, what else, thin crust pizza--my mother scrupulously wrote out brand names in full).\nIt was a little like ordering chemicals for a laboratory, sans any knowledge of chemistry--or, for that matter, laboratories, although my ignorance of the distinction between baking soda and baking powder cannot be entirely the root of my confusion. Eventually I--and my siblings--learned the difference between tomato paste and tomato sauce, and could readily distinguish one brand of laundry detergent from a similarly-styled knock-off, but my shame-faced trips back to the mothercart never ceased. I would track her down, most often in the produce section--she was usually loath to trust us with the delicate task of selecting the very best fruits and vegetables--and hand her back my portion of the list, asking for an explanation. Usually it amounted to a failure of awareness on my part--get the kind of soap we always get, of course!\nWhy did the author feel shame during the grocery trip?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- She couldn't read her mother's writing.\n- She wasn't trusted to pick out produce.\n- Because she had a hard time figuring out what exactly the mother wanted.\n- not enough information",

        "Read the following context and answer the question.\nContext: The collaborative process between me and Claire Bridge has been good so far. Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows:\nHow would you define creativity?\nWhat does it mean to you to be an artist?\nDo you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy?\nChange and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography.\nYou seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like \u201cDark Matter\u201d, \u201cTouching Infinity\u201d, \u201cWe are made of Stars\u201d, \u201cRising tides\u201d and \u201cA drop in the ocean\u201d or \u201cAlchemy\u201d. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences?\nWhat continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist?\nWe both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire\u2019s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire\u2019s practice. After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September. Hopefully if all goes well we will both have an artist portrait that lives up to our expectations.\nQuestion: What does the author think most likely believe that the question and answer session will achieve?\nAnswer:",

        "Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the \u2018worried well\u2019 is certainly alive and kicking.\nVitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices.\nContrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don\u2019t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables.\nWhile it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn\u2019t been well studied in large population groups.\nUsing data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn\u2019t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men.\nThe eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium.\nProving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium.\nFor someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement \u2018just in case\u2019 offers little to no benefit.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: Why did research participants who took supplements realistically have higher nutrient levels than those who didn't?\nOptions:\n\nA. because health conscious individuals generally ate healthier food to begin with\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. because they ate more meat\n\nD. because the supplements gave them more nutrients",

He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada.\nSo one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that)\nWe were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed.\nAnd then,\nI saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes.\nCool,\nWhat I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voil\u00e0! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me.\nAfter a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal\u2019s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.\nAnd after that, never was I ever bothered by anyone in the school.(^^)\nHow long did the bullying go on?\n- not enough information\n- It's still going on\n- A few days at school\n- Longer than a few months",

We must not allow them to succeed.\u201d\nCongressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe.\nHicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats.\n\u201cThis is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,\u201d said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff.\n\nBut there was more pushback from the White House this week.

Mid-year one afternoon post-dismissal, a small white car drove past dangerously close to me and honked as I made my way to the bus stand home. If there had actually been any malice intended, I would have been caught out totally by surprise.\nThe next day, he wondered aloud why I did not respond or react to him flippantly wanting to ram me with his car as he drove by.

While driving at quite a clip near his home, he had barreled through a residential cross-junction and broadsided a delivery van that had charged through the open junction with no regulating traffic lights.\nThe van ended up upside down on the road shoulder and his parents-issued car was out of commission for like, three weeks.

        "WHITE HOUSE \u2014 President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \"absolute right\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \"totally unconstitutional.\"\nWhile Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries.\n\"I was shocked\" by Trump\u2019s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University.\n\"No president has ever tried it,\" she told VOA News. \"It\u2019s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \"most congresses would impeach him.\"\nBloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \"it\u2019s an admission of guilt,\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action.\nThe professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \"absolutely constitutional.\"\nAnother constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \"I think it is important to note that the president\u2019s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\"\nAccording to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

        "Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries \u2013 heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food \u2013 has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that\u2019s why it is commonly added in processed foods.\nCombining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods.\nTeasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken.\nSalt promotes over-eating\nEleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn\u2019t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten.\nQuestion: What is likely the job of the people who conducted the study at Deakin University?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products!\nOkoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven.\nWhen you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made.\nThe first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!). Yoko assured me that this soap was incredibly gentle and was not at all drying. Lucky for her I am...\nQuestion: Why are the products not made until an order is placed?\nOptions:\n- not enough information \n - so they are as fresh as they can be \n - so that the ingredients don't expire \n - so the company doesn't end up with too much product\n===\nThe correct answer is",

That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate \u2014 and votes \u2014 on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children.\nSince moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \"queen of the hill\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and \u2014 with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on \u2014 Republicans need just two more signatures.\nBut that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November.\nThe debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution.\nLawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess.\nDenham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive.\n\"We've had an agreement in principle,\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

The chairs in the waiting room are leather and the copy machine has a million attachments and there's pictures on the wall that I don't know what they're supposed to be.

Dennis shook my hand and put me in a chair that was slings and tube steel. The calendar next to his desk had a ski scene on it. Behind him was solid books, law books all in the same binding, also some biographies and political stuff. \"Too bad you couldn't make the reunion,\" Dennis said. \"It was a hoot.\" \"I just felt weird about it,\" I said. I still did. It looked like he wanted me to go on, so I said, \"I knew there'd be a bunch of y'all there that had really made good, and I guess I...I don't know.

There was a dark side to success.\nFairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits.\nThe majority of these studies agree on one thing \u2013 there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career.\nThe studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals \u2013 it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed.\nThe danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm.

        "Alona's persistent knocking at the door of room 412 went unanswered for three minutes as she nervously shuffled her feet. Her book bag was super-saturated with textbooks, notebooks, schedules, rough drafts, and various other forms of academic paraphernalia. It was getting heavier. She continued to knock, even though there had as yet been no answer, because the note card tacked to the right of the door indicated that these indeed were Prof. Turgy K. Sigger's office hours. She could see the light under the door and thought she had heard a groan. Just before she decided to give up, slow feet approached from the opposite side, then silence; with a dramatic turn of the knob, the door swung open.\n\"Was this trip really necessary?\" asked Prof. Sigger, blinking and brushing his oily, graying hair back into place.\n\"These are your office hours,\" Alona replied. She nervously smiled, feeling the corners of her mouth twitch. Somewhere in the darkened hall, a janitor coughed.\n\"All right,\" conceded Prof. Sigger. \"Come in.\"\nThe carpet was smothered by leaning towers of textbooks. Papers lined the left side of the desk, above which was a small note card which read \"To Be Graded.\" On the right side, the oak finish gleamed of the mid-morning light piercing the Venetian blinds.\n\"You've come about your final project,\" Prof. Sigger stated.\n\"It's only mid-term,\" Alona reminded him.\n\"Oh yes, yes,\" continued Prof. Sigger, without conscious embarrassment. \"Mid-term grade. I think I have it here. Somewhere.\" His hands disappeared into the left side of his desk.\n\"You told the class that we would get a C if we maintained that Coca-Cola isn't a crypto-fascist conspiracy.\"\n\"Oh yes,\" said Prof. Sigger. \"We were discussing social issues, as I remember. I was quoting Marx and some little idiot brought up Rush Limbaugh.\"\n\"That was me,\" Alona muttered.\nProf. Sigger believes that:\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- Alona is there to discuss her mid-term grade\n- not enough information\n- Alona is there to discuss her final project\n- Alona is there to discuss social issues",

        "Read the following context and answer the question.\nContext: I was lost.\nAs I sat parked at the old service station, I pulled out the maps and tried to do a little backtracking. It didn't take me long to figure out where I had made the wrong turn. I had tried following my memory instead of Luna's directions and wound up about eighty miles off course. My gas tank was pushing 'E' but fortunately the service station was open.\nWhen I stepped out of my Jeep, I could feel the soles of my boots melt on the asphalt. The heat coming off the cracked and pitted cement peeled off in waves that rolled out in every endless direction. The barren mountains in the distance looked unstable, like I was looking at them through a window pane slicked with olive oil.\nI slogged my way over to the gas pump and wrapped my shirt around the handle to keep my skin from burning against the desert-baked metal. The heat was so great I worried the fumes would ignite.\nA dirty round man stood in the shadowy doorway of the ramshackle service station and stared at me while he rubbed his hands inside an oily red rag. The oval name-patch stitched to his coveralls was loose at one end and curled like a leaf in the heat. His name was Jack.\nI topped off the tank and then walked over to him. \"You work here?\" I knew it was a stupid question the second it left my mouth. He and I were the only living things for fifty miles in any direction. Who the hell else would be working here?\n\"Who the hell else would be working here?\" he said.\nI shrugged my shoulders and pulled out my wallet. Jack wobbled inside behind a glass counter filled with everything from belt buckles to oil funnels. \"That your momma's car?\" he asked.\nIt's impossible to tell what kind of psychological impact this heat would have on a man who lived out here alone, but I was sure it wasn't positive.\nQuestion: When did the narrator walk over to the man?\nAnswer:",

        "The rate of incarceration in the U.S. is the world\u2019s highest, leading to what many lawmakers and policy analysts say is a nationwide imprisonment epidemic. But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA.\nA bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote \u201cstrikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,\u201d Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump said \u201cthe strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.\u201d Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, \u201cOur whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.\u201d\nIf the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide $50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates.\nBut the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill\u2019s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate.\nIn a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization.\nJeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act \u201cwere anchored in falsehoods.\u201d\nHe added the legislation passed today \u201cis a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration\u201d a move also welcomed by many House Republicans.\n\u201cRather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,\u201d House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican...\nWhy were some Democratic Senators opposed to passage of the First Step Act?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. they did not think it could be successfully implemented and might lead to the prevalence of private prisons\n\nB. they opposed the bipartisan support that the bill received\n\nC. not enough information\n\nD. they disagreed that mass incarceration was an issue",

        "\u201cWhat was your worst makeup disaster?\u201d\nDo fingernails count? I hope so, because this is a good one:\nI was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico.\nThe hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there.\nWe dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red.\nWhen the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine.\nThe waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought.\nUnfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire.\nThe waiter\u2019s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place.\nI was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic!\nQuickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under.\nEver the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I\u2019m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening.\nSo much for my attempt at appearing \u201cclassy\u201d and \u201csophisticated\u201d\u2026.\nAt the end of the story how did the author feel?\n- refined.\n- Classy.\n- Embarrassed.\n- not enough information",

        "The collaborative process between me and Claire Bridge has been good so far. Upon finding out her email address we had a brief email exchange culminating in me sending her a list of potential questions for the interview. Claire quite liked a lot of the questions, but overall there were too many, so we proceeded to reduce the number of questions to six main questions. These questions would then form the basis of the artist portrait, with an attempt to limit answers to no more than a minute, so little had to be cut for the final edit. The six questions we arrived at are as follows:\nHow would you define creativity?\nWhat does it mean to you to be an artist?\nDo you feel a painting or piece of art can house an energy/a feeling from the original artist? Do you feel that your own works house this energy?\nChange and transformation are recurrent themes in your work. What are you exploring and why do these fascinate you? And recently we saw a change in your medium too, incorporating video works and photography.\nYou seem to draw on many influences in your work, from quantum physics, astrophysics, to environmental ecology, psychology, philosophy and metaphysics. With titles like \u201cDark Matter\u201d, \u201cTouching Infinity\u201d, \u201cWe are made of Stars\u201d, \u201cRising tides\u201d and \u201cA drop in the ocean\u201d or \u201cAlchemy\u201d. Can you tell us something more about the convergence of these ideas and influences?\nWhat continues to motivate and inspire you as an artist?\nWe both felt these questions addressed the initial topic of exploring creativity, explored why Claire became an artist, gives insight into Claire\u2019s work and practise and looks toward the future of Claire\u2019s practice. After refining the questions, we proceeded to organise a day to film, which will be on the 16th September.

        "The Trump administration's decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census divided Capitol Hill on Tuesday, with Democrats saying the addition could skew the results and alter millions in government funding, while some Republicans praised it as a \"commonsense\" move.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday.\nIn a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted.\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department.\n\"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy. A question on citizenship is a reasonable, commonsense addition to the census,\" Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement Tuesday.\nBut Democrats said the question would have the opposite effect \u2014 discouraging undocumented immigrants and citizen family members from responding to the census, undermining the accuracy of the results.\n\"We cannot accept an incomplete or unfair count in 2020 \u2014 too much is at stake,\" Rep. Carolyn Maloney, co-chair of the Congressional Census Caucus, told VOA. \"The census mandated by the [U.S.] Constitution affects the way that Federal and state funds are distributed and how district lines are drawn for both the city, state and Federal level.\"\nQuestion: Senator Ted Cruz probably is a what based on his support?\nOptions:\n- Immigrant. \n - not enough information \n - Democrat. \n - Republican.\n===\nThe correct answer is",

I'm not even sure if I was officially asked, I just wound up heading back to New Jersey when school was out. I think my parents thought it was a good enough deal. They were already having some problems and without Nonna there anymore to take care of me I think my cousin's house on the coast seemed like as good a spot as any to stick me for the summer. It certainly wasn't because of any great love between me and my cousin. We weren't really very good friends at that point. I think she saw me as sort of foisted off on her and getting in the way of her summers. Which was a fair enough judgment. But she could have been nicer. It's pretty amazing that she wound up as my Maid of Honor. Time does strange things. Your lovable jack-ass of a father would mention something about magic in here. You know if you took a group of fifty strangers, had them chat with your father for half an hour then with me for half an hour, then told them that one of us was an English Professor and one of us was head of distribution in the northeast for a large soft drink manufacturing concern, I'm pretty sure all fifty would peg your father as the English Professor and me as the head of distribution. He's honestly so good at what he does that I can almost allow him to claim it's magic except that it'd be nice if he took credit for some of the things he's done with his life.

        "\u201cHave you ever been in a situation that was getting out of control and you were able to calm it down before it escalated further? What was the situation and what did you do or say?\u201d\nAs senior members of a Boy Scout Troop, other adults and I had to instruct two younger member on how to recognize and control emotions in the context of conflict. These two guys had a history of conflicts and I knew people won\u2019t always be present to control them. They had to grow up and be self-sufficient.\nOn one camping trip they yet again had another heated argument over something trivial that kept escalating. Rather than jump in, I wanted to see how they deescalate the situation on their own.\nSuddenly, one of them pulls out a pocket knife and says \u201c[insert demand here] or I\u2019m gonna [insert some action with a knife to a person].\u201d\nThe situation has clearly escalated too far. Immediately I rushed in and yelled, \u201cSTOP! DROP IT, NOW!\u201d He immediately dropped the knife, sat down, and began crying.\nWhat happens after that is irrelevant. Perhaps it\u2019s due to my quiet nature and sudden outburst that produced the shock effect. But more importantly the use of straight-forward, succinct commands can control the situation because all parties involved are automatically in natural fight-flight mode where elaborate, long explanations aren\u2019t going to be interpreted correctly by listeners for the purposes of deescalating the situation\u2019s climax. The long talk comes when the immediate conflict is temporarily resolved.\n* IMPORTANT NOTE: This incident is not a reflection on the Boy Scout of America, its spirit, or the use of such tools.

Cue towering mountains harbouring mushrooms and berries, lush valleys and turquoise lakes, vines grown on pergolas, enormous plates of sauerkraut and polenta in abundant portions, delicious wines and rustic cakes with German names.\nTrento is the capital of Trentino, an unusual region of Italy because its official languages are Italian and German and it is actually made up of two self-governing provinces and is known as Trentino-Alto Adige or Trentino-Sudtirol. Confused? Since the eighth century, it has been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and only a century ago did it become Italian. It is squeezed between Lombardy and the Veneto to the west and southeast and to the north lies Austria and Switzerland. So it is no surprise that many of the food influences come from its neighbours \u2014 particularly the northern ones.\nEating in the region means eating heartily, even in the summer sunshine, we enjoyed abundant portions of canederli (large rustic dumplings made of bread, herbs and meat, ham or cheese in broth), masses of soft, creamy polenta with thinly sliced roast pork or sausage ragu and slow-cooked beans or thick venison steaks, sauerkraut and gnocchi (sometimes made of out of polenta). I think one waiter was highly disappointed that we weren\u2019t able to finish our gargantuan plates one hot day on a mountain with a view of the Dolomites.

        "SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA \u2014 The U.S. election calendar could be a key factor in determining the scope and timing of a potential deal to end the North Korean nuclear program.\nPlanning is progressing for both the upcoming summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the end of April and the expected meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim in late May or early June.\nPresident Trump said Tuesday that there had been talks at \u201cextremely high levels\u201d between his administration and the North Korean government. Later it was reported that Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and a secretary of state nominee, met recently with Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang.\nTrump also noted the talks have been marked by \u201ca lot of goodwill\u201d and that \u201cthere has been a major change in terms of North Korea\u2019s behavior,\u201d since Kim\u2019s Olympic outreach this year, in which he sent a large delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter games in South Korea, suspended nuclear and missile tests, and expressed a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks.\nThe turn toward diplomacy has reduced, for now, the potential for conflict over the North\u2019s accelerated efforts last year to develop an operational nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland.\nThe North Korean leader\u2019s decision to engage in denuclearization talks was likely motivated by both Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign, which increased sanctions and the threat of military action against the North, and by South Korean President Moon\u2019s reassuring outreach efforts to improve inter-Korean relations.\nTrump\u2019s motivation in pursuing a nuclear deal with North Korea, in addition to resolving a growing national security threat, could also have a political component.\nAccording to North Korea analysts at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, the Trump administration is likely calculating how achieving such an agreement could help boost the president\u2019s chances for re-election in 2020.\n\u201cIf I were Trump, I...\nHow long will the meeting between Trump and Kim probably last?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- A week\n- A few hours\n- A couple minutes\n- not enough information",

She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat.

But how much does this internal list define us?\nI believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: \u201cHow we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives\u201d. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it\u2019s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday.\nWithin my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of \u2018a day in the life\u2019. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of \u2018the everyday\u2019.\nTo create a sense of \u2018the day\u2019 or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses.\nQuestion: Why did the author change his views about what was the best representation of himself?\nAnswer:",

I get irritated and shut my motor off basically saying, buddy I entered the street first you were parked never looked before you hurriedly pulled forward. So he shuts off his motor and smiled good as to say stalemate. I'm thinking I have no place I have to be, I'll wait rather than trying to back up half the block without hitting somebodies car. We wait, he gets out of his car goes into his house, no cell phone back then it was the pager (beepers) era. I wasnt sure why he was going in, but probably nit good outcome for me.

Fear of falling can also seriously affect an aging adult\u2019s quality of life and sadly, can keep a person from being active and thriving.\nSo, many seniors and family caregivers are interested in fall prevention because the risks are so great.

Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways.\nMy husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him.\nI was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable.\nMy husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex \u2014 not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy.\nI often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.  At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he\u2019d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would \u201ccure\u201d him.\nFeeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved.  There was nothing wrong with me \u2014 I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused.\nWhat now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy.

        "Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that.\nMany leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance.\nThis is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don\u2019t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP.\nAs such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization.\nSadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same \u2018ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in.\nSo much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn\u2019t be\u2026frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice.\nAt a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\" he said.\nOpinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \"You know what it is? You get complacent,\" he said. \"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\"\nThe president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November.\n\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\" Trump told the audience. \"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\"\nAccording to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms.\nHistorically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent.\nQuestion: Trump's current presidency will last:\nAnswer:",

DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe.\nTrump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe.\nEarlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \"assurances\" that firing Mueller was \"not even under consideration.\"\nThe latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\"\nThe tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy.\n\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\nThe renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson.

        "Defense Secretary Jim Mattis promised Thursday the Pentagon will \"notify\" Congress before any possible military action in Syria, where the U.S. is considering responding to a suspected chemical weapons attack.\n\n\"There will be notification to leadership, of course, prior to the attack,\" Mattis said in his testimony at the House Armed Services Committee. \"We will report to Congress. We will keep open lines of communication.\"\n\nBut notably, Mattis did not indicate the Trump administration would seek congressional approval before the strike, which presumably would target the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\nTrump says the U.S. will soon launch \"nice and new and smart\" missiles in response to last week's suspected poison gas attack, which left scores dead in a rebel-held area. Trump blames Assad for the attack.\n\nA U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war.\nU.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \"hostilities\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution.\n\nAdditionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world.\n\nThe Trump administration has used those authorizations as justification for its current war in Syria. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, and helps lead an international coalition against Islamic State in Syria and neighboring Iraq.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of U.S. lawmakers have not publicly objected to the administration's legal rationale for those missions.

The mother had placed a water bottle filled with VODKA in the refrigerator. The grandmother used that VODKA to fill the bottle with the powder added.\nAt some point after the baby wouldn\u2019t drink the bottle (because of the taste I imagine) but had drank some the Grandmother realized it was Vodka instead of WATER. She gave the baby Powdered Charcoal and the baby vomited the milk mix up. The baby was Ok and no harm done.\nShe was lucky to have the powdered charcoal around. It is hard to find now in the stores. When I was a child (50\u2019s-60) it was common for All medicine chests to be supplied with Charcoal. I still keep some of that in My medicine chest. I live in a rural area.

Rice is a good filler and does No harm. (like I would not use wheat cereal)\nI also would give a baby warm tea when they had a stomach ache. Tea of course has caffeine in it.

        "Cooking food is something we have done since the first caveman threw a mammoth steak on the fire. While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed.\nEvery time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it.\nAnd even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases. And of course, let\u2019s not forget that heating food kills some of the nasty microbes that can cause food poisoning.\nThe principle behind a raw food diet is that cooking food destroys the natural enzymes and nutrients that would otherwise give us optimal health and control body weight. A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state.\nNow on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win. So that gets a big tick.\nUnquestionably, there are many benefits to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and fibre and low in kilojoules. But is raw superior to cooked? A review of 28 research studies found eaters of both cooked and raw vegetables had a lower risk of cancer compared to people who did not eat many vegetables in the first place.\nWhere the science gets murky is the claim that raw food is better because cooking destroys the enzymes found in plants. It is 100 percent correct that cooking will do this. But so too does digestion. Few enzymes survive their trip through the hydrochloric acid spa bath in the stomach. And those plant enzymes are essential only to the plants. The...\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nWhy doesn't raw food give the body access to more enzymes?",

So this is about fulfilling our promises to the American people.\"\n\nHowever, since the president was last in the country, he and his Republican allies in Congress face a new political landscape in the wake of last week's gubernatorial election victories by Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey.\nIn Virginia, exit polls showed that many voters were motivated primarily by their opposition to the president.\n\"The fact that the president is so polarizing and so unpopular with approval ratings generally under about 40 percent, and Democrats are going to be extra-motivated to come out,\" said University of Virginia political analyst Kyle Kondik.\nKondik said the strong Democratic showing in statewide races in Virginia last week was the best non-presidential election showing for the party since 2006, the last time Democrats nationally won control of the House of Representatives. Many Democrats believe a focus on Trump could help them retake control of the House next year.\n\"You can sort of smell when a wave is beginning, no guarantee it continues, but it is likely to,\" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. \"And that smell that was in the air in 2005 is in the air now.\"\nTrump's approval ratings remain historically low for a first-year president \u2014 with several recent polls showing him below 40 percent \u2014 which could be a warning sign for Republicans ahead of next year's elections.\n\n\"If the president is where he is today, I think that is going to be very difficult for the party to even hold the House of...\nQuestion: What is an expected political strategy of Democratic leader Chuck Schumer after the time of this article?\nAnswer:",

No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands.\nIt was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary.\nPatch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day.\nEventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel.\n\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\" Patch shouted up.\n\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: Which character in the story is the oldest?\nOptions:\n\nA.

The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat.

        "When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. \u201cIt is the key to self improvement!\u201d, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don\u2019t quite practice what they preach.\nSeeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult.\nHere\u2019s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage.\nIn my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let\u2019s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don\u2019t share the same confidence.\nAn understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: \u201cI might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better\u201d. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.\nWhat is probably true about most people?\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. most people want to be timid\n\nC. most people want to be criticized\n\nD. most people probably want to be confident",

SIGAR has been unable to publicly disclose the exact number of Afghan forces killed, because that information continues to be classified by Washington and Kabul. The violence has led to increased reports of Afghan military desertions, but that information too has been classified.\nSenior U.S. military officials repeatedly have acknowledged the nearly 17-year-old conflict remains a stalemate, even while touting some successes under the new strategy announced by President Donald Trump in August.\nThose success include the increasing capability of the Afghan military, which began conducting airstrikes two years ago. The Afghan air force carries out between four to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense.\nBut the Kabul government controls just over half of the country's districts, SIGAR says.\nTrump's strategy appeared to commit the U.S. to Afghanistan indefinitely.

At the end, the leaders of the communist North and Democratic South embraced prior to announcing a joint declaration committing to denuclearization and peace.\n\"Today, Chairman Kim Jong Un and I confirmed that the realization of the nuclear-free Korean peninsula through complete denuclearization is our common goal,\" said President Moon Jae-in at a ceremony to announce what they are calling the Panmunjom declaration.\nThe North Korean leader also endorsed the joint declaration as well as past inter-Korean agreements without elaborating or specifically acknowledging the agreed upon outcome to dismantle his country's threatening nuclear program.\n\"We have decided to open this transitional phase of improvement in relations and development by thoroughly implementing the North-South Declarations and all the agreements that have already been adopted,\" said Kim.\nKim is now the first North Korean leader to cross into South Korea. He was greeted by Moon, who waited on the South Korean side of the borderline in the village of Panmunjom, the historic site, where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953.

It literally was like the movie Animal House\nNow these 2 friends (let's call them Bill and Ted) were a little dorky compared to the rest of the other guys. We all played sports in high school and college and they were more like bookworms. Borderline alcoholics but bookworms. They were really awkward around girls but funny as hell around guys.\nLong story short. Both of them got involved into serious relationships after college and ended up marrying these girls. One girl was this born again Christian who vowed to cleanse Bill from his evil ways. Bill was so far removed from his friends (the wolfpack!) that he didn't even invite us to his wedding. It's been maybe 14-15 yrs now and I have no clue what he's doing. I think one of my friends did attend the wedding but it was only because they desperately needed a groomsmen.\nTed married this girl who seemed cool at first but after marriage, he stopped coming to any and all get togethers. He always had an excuse. He ended up moving a few hrs away and eventually just stopped responding to us. He did show up to a mutual friend's wedding maybe 3 yrs ago. He has a baby now but he's alot different than how he used to be.\nOther than Bill and Ted, all my other friends got married and have pretty normal marriages. Meaning that family is priority but if you got some free time, go enjoy yourself.

        "I was introduced to the amazing range of handmade products from Okoii back in July and intended to post reviews in early September; however, was struck down with a particularly potent uterine parasite that left me comatosed on the couch each evening by about 8.00pm, so blogging had to take a massive back step. Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products!\nOkoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven.\nWhen you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made.\nThe first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!). Yoko assured me that this soap was incredibly gentle and was not at all drying. Lucky for her I am...\nQuestion: Where is the companies owner, Yoko, originally from?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

The verdict is about to be given on the accused killer from Series 1 when the inevitable happens... Cue title music.\nThis moment has even gained a moniker in British homes, based on the theme tune to the real masters of the four-times-a-week cliffhanger, London-based soap opera Eastenders. It's call a \"ba...ba...ba...ba, ba, ba-ba-ba-ba\" (YouTube will provide overseas readers with auditory explanation).\nEastenders is such a master of writing in the perfect pace that every 28 minute episode ends with a tantalising screen freeze on the latest shocked face / smirking baddy / confused victim. For really big stories the cliffhanger can last significantly longer. This week, to celebrate the show's 30 year birthday, we will finally find out the answer to a question unanswered for the past 14 months: \"Who killed Lucy Beale?\"\nNow, most classrooms do not involve murder, incest, dodgy deals and danger, but \"good teaching\" encourages a type of pacing that totally ignores the ingredients that have millions in the edges of their seats every day: the good old cliffhanger. In fact, we see teachers giving away the punchline at the beginning: \"Today we are learning this:...\"\nWhat is probably true about the episode of EastEnders that was celebrating the show's 30 year birthday?\n- not enough information\n- probably a medium amount of people watched the show\n- probably it was widely watched in Britain\n- probably not many watched the show",

        "My partner\u2019s parents decided to help with all the planning and set up for his sister\u2019s wedding. I am sure part of the reason was because they had offered to foot part of the expenses.\nThere came a point in the planning, when his mom seemed to sort of run-amok with her ideas. His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don\u2019t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways.\nOne of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.)\nSo imagine it\u2019s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people.\nMy partner\u2019s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn\u2019t even part of your ancestry. It\u2019s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don\u2019t really want.\nSoon after that, my partner\u2019s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister.\nI think the experience made us both content to elope.\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nWhy was the partner's sister cringing at the wedding?",

So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows.

        "Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance \u2013 to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit.\nSupplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation.\nBut what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking.\nTo see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers.\nThe clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality.\nFrom the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D.\nOne study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...\nAfter the study medical professionals probably recommended that\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. only the elderly take supplements\n\nC. only pregnant women take supplements\n\nD. only certain patients take supplements",

But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control.\nOn my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone\u2019s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again.\nOn another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes.\nHe was unpredictable and he didn\u2019t care.

        "Yes, sometimes you just meet people and you know straight away that they are not trustworthy. Before my relationship there were certain boys in my life that I would meet and I would be able to tell straight away whether or not they were going to be a decent partner. I find that I am not attracted to the pretty boy, who loves himself, I go for the more reserved and shy people that I know will treat me right.\nOne time there was this guy back at school who I knew was all over the girls and that didn't want a relationship. He was rude to the teachers and a bit of a bad boy and all the girls swooned over him. I on the other hand was not, at one point he managed to get my number and was texting me. We spoke for a bit but once he started asking me for pictures of myself I stopped the contact, I knew he wasn't to be trusted from the beginning and decided he wasn't right for me. Then it was quite funny how one day we had a class where the rooms were next to each other and in between was a printer that both classes shared. I went to the room to print my work, and he was there waiting also. He asked me for a hug and just raised an eyebrow, then I saw my work had printed so I lent over to grab it and he thought I was going in for the hug. So he shut his eyes and held out his arms only to open them to see me walking off with my paper. His friend also saw what happened and laughed, I think he was a bit embarrassed.\nBut we were young back then and he has found someone now and seems very happy, as am I.\nQuestion: Who did she meet at school?\nOptions:\n- The rude boy. \n - The pretty boy. \n - not enough information \n - The bad boy.\n===\nThe correct answer is",

We were living in an old house at the time and I was home alone with the youngest child (who was around six months old), balanced on my hip as I opened the door. The visitor looked genuine, dressed in the expected uniform. He was around 6.3 and probably not the most tidily presented utility man I'd met, but I believed him to be genuine and willingly invited him in out of the foul weather. It was pouring down outside, a freezing cold winter's day. As I closed the door I remembered that I should have asked to see his company I.D. , so as I opened the meter cupboard and switched on the light, I politely said, 'Oops, I should have asked to see your I.D. if you don't mind?. He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'.\nThere was an embarrassed silence. He continued to stare down at me without making a move for what seemed like minutes but was probably seconds. He didn't produce his I.D., instead he almost grudgingly read the meter as I looked on and then he swiftly left without saying goodbye. I closed the door and locked it, and then took a while to get my pulse rate back to normal and to realise I'd just learned a very big lesson. Such a creepy individual, I didn't make that mistake again.\nQuestion: When did the man refuse to show his ID?\nOptions:\n- While he was performing a meter check.\n- During a cold winter day.\n- After he was inside the home.\n- not enough information",

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly \u201cleaking\u201d blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty.\nApparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained.\nThe nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she\u2019d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn\u2019t keep myself from laughing loud and long.\nShe then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned.

        "\u201cTeachers like to agree with each other, when we talk about learning. It\u2019s hard to change that, when the model we have wanted to make work has nonetheless been failing for 40 years.\u201d Professor Brian Boyd\nNo area has remained up there in the contentiousness charts in Scotland as the notion of business and education working together to do something better for our young people.\nMost schools do not \u2018partner\u2019 with colleges or universities. Instead, they are production facilities for undergraduates and college entrants. Fewer are set up to systematically provide apprenticeship opportunities as well as learning. At NoTosh, we\u2019ve been working on a few, nascent projects to change the attitudes of schools from being these production facilities into something more of a life support - what metrics of success might we use if schools judged their success on the results of their alumni, five, ten or twenty years down the line, much like universities do?\nCity of Glasgow College have partnered with Newlands Junior College (NJC) to make the experience of a day in college more than what, in other circumstances, is too often perceived as a day off from school. The Junior College is called this, and not a school, for that very reason, to mark it out as a stepping stone between school and full-blown college. NoTosh helped last August to provoke the team around their thoughts of what 'unschool' might look like.\nThe College was backed and founded by Jim McColl, one of Scotland\u2019s top business people.\nIn the future, suggests, McColl, might be be possible to take funding of learning out of its pre-existing silos, particularly for this group of students, about 60 in every city at these ages, who just need a different approach to the traditional comprehensive approach? A crossover funding model that helps learning happen in both \u2018school\u2019 or Junior College and college or university might be interesting. In fact, some of the world\u2019s top universities are thinking of such models for their own students: Stanford\u2019s 2025 project talks about the...\nWhat does McColl probably think about non-traditional approaches to education?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- McColl is probably against that idea completely\n- not enough information\n- McColl probably favors them for many students\n- McColl is probably a little receptive to the idea",

        "I love going to the spa. Honestly, who doesn't. These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas.\nI had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage.  Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!).\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: John believes that\nOptions:\n- Fred was his friend\n- Fred was not a good guest\n- not enough information\n- Fred was married",

One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party\u2019s conservative and moderate wings.\nThe compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide $25 billion in funding for Trump\u2019s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.\nRepublicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation.\n\u201cWe can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,\u201d Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families.\nThe president\u2019s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,\u201d Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota.\nLater, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy:\n\u201cThe border is going to be just as tough as it\u2019s been\u201d despite...\nQuestion: What did Trump think of his meeting with party leaders\nOptions:\n\nA.

        "My first memory of cooking was with my grandmother, Rosemary, in Sydney. She taught me how to make scrambled eggs on her electric stovetop, the kind with the coiled heating elements, in her small, linoleum-lined kitchen with cupboards that stuck a little when they closed. She was not an exceptional cook \u2014 I can remember plenty of bland and overcooked vegetables and custard made with powder to pour into pre-bought pie cases with tinned pineapple, her specialty \u2014 but she worked hard to put a balanced, home-cooked meal on the table three times a day, every day.\nThe eldest of eight children, she dropped out of school during the Depression to help her single mother look after her siblings and work as a seamstress at David Jones. When the Second World War broke out and she was engaged to my grandfather, Aubrey, she started working on war-torn planes (\u201csometimes looking as if a steam roller has gone over them,\u201d she said) as a sheet metal worker, putting them back together, when many of the men who used to do this work were off fighting the war. She said it was just like dressmaking, only using different materials.\nShe had a twinkle in her eye and a distinct laugh that can really only be described as a cackle. She was a strong, incredibly smart woman with a fighter spirit who led her female co-workers out on the airport tarmac one day on a strike to earn equal wages to men. I am so proud that her story is taught as part of the Australian primary school curriculum.\nHer dream was to have a home with that electric stove. In 1943 when she was 28 she was interviewed for Australian Women\u2019s Weekly magazine for an article on women in men\u2019s jobs during the war, where there is a photo of her that is etched in my memory, dressed in white, wearing a white bandana tied in a knot at the top of her dark curls, a plane behind her.\nWhat happened to Rosemary when she was 28?\n\nA. she made overcooked vegetables\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. she had a twinkle in her eye\n\nD. she was interviewed by Australian Women's Weekly magazine",

        "If you\u2019ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you\u2019re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the \u201ceighth wonder of the world.\u201d\nThe version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there\u2019s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice\u2019s major waterway.\nThe Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge.\nBeginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge\u2019s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge.\nAndrea Palladio\u2019s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte\u2019s.\nWhat is the only bridge across Venice\u2019s major waterway until the 1800s?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- The wide Grand Canal Bridge\n- The pontoon bridge\n- not enough information\n- The Rialto Bridge",

The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \"rapid response\" to highlight any \"misstatements\" or \"contradictions,\" Fox News reports.\nComey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \"bright white half-moons\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.\n\nComey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.\n\nTrump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians.\nThe firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation.

        "At an early meeting of the British Sociological Association\u2019s \u201cActivism in Sociology Forum\u201d members met to discuss how we might play a more campaigning role in the world outside the academy. Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in \u201cthe real world\u201d (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here \u2013 I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting \u2013 was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda?\nI learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and \u201cembarrassing\u201d. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda?\nBecause of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments). In addition, there is substantial funding directed toward the \u201cimpact industry\u201d; the consultants, think tanks, PR firms, funding schemes, new software programmes, impact managers, specialist impact case study...\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What is probably true about the narrator\nOptions:\n- they like to contribute ideas\n- not enough information\n- they are reserved\n- they are shy",

Children endure emotional, sexual, physical abuse. And more.\nThe saddest story I ever heard was from the kid in my AP Lit class who had taken her senior year to accept invitations from education reform groups to speak around the country, which she did, without doing any of her homework.

She had pain relief as and when needed to make her comfortable and that often results in people ultimately overdosing.\nMum had Alzheimer's and was howling and writhing in agony so we were giving her pain relief but daughters knew it would probably result in her death - which they were right about possibly happening and in their grief and panic, started trying to prevent us from doing anything. Didn\u2019t want us getting near her at all and we had to go through an awful scenario of trying to explain what we had to do for Mum and why and when they still wouldn\u2019t have it or allow us near, we had to do what nobody wants and go against their wishes by administering the pain relief anyway.\nOne daughter screamed the place down, threatened to have me arrested and struck off / said she would go to the papers and tell them about how we killed her Mum and in the end she had to be removed from the bedroom.\nHer Mum was given the pain relief, immediately relaxed and fell asleep then died peacefully in her sleep about 15 mins later.\nThe saddest thing is her daughter wasn\u2019t able to be there and see her Mum dropping off so peacefully and her last memory will forever be of her screaming and thrashing about as she (daughter) was physically removed from the room.\nTragic.\nQuestion: How long was the mother sick?\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- since breakfast\n- several years\n- all weekend",

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart.\nThe two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it.\nHe knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it.\nFrom behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown.\nA shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered.

        "The U.S. Supreme Court plunged into the politically messy issue of redrawing congressional and legislative districts Tuesday, in a case that could have profound implications for both major political parties for years to come.\nThe high court heard oral arguments in a case brought by Democratic voters in Wisconsin. They argued that a Republican redistricting plan for the state assembly was so overtly partisan that it violated constitutional protections of freedom of speech and equal protection under the law for Wisconsin voters.\nA lower federal court sided with the challengers last year and against Republican state officials in Wisconsin. Officials argued Tuesday that they had not violated any constitutional rights when they drew up new boundaries for state assembly districts. \"Our legislature followed traditional redistricting criteria, which is what they have been required to do and we think they followed that and that the justices will agree,\" Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel told reporters in front of the court following the oral arguments.\nThe process of state legislatures redrawing congressional and legislative district boundaries has been enmeshed in politics for two centuries. Early on, the process was referred to as \u201cgerrymandering,\u201d where one party or the other tries to gain an electoral advantage by redrawing district boundaries to maximize their voting clout.\nRepublicans have had success in several states in redrawing congressional and legislative voting districts and that has helped them maintain their majority in the House of Representatives. Democrats have come under fire as well for partisan maps in states where they control the legislature, like Maryland and Massachusetts.\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments, the more liberal high court justices seemed open to the case brought by Democratic voters.

He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief.\nLast year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye.

They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible.

        "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a great film, and often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don\u2019t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i\u2019m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I\u2019m very intrigued to properly analyse it.\nThe first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious \ud83d\ude09 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they\u2019ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame. It looks like they may have used a cutter to achieve that effect as its a very specific area, essentially just the top half of the cowboy thats drenched ins shadow. Theres also this curious black circular shadow which exists at the very top of the door near the cowboys head which permanently stays extremely dark, much darker than the rest of the shadows in the frame.

Whenever I see this question I want to scream at the person 'no, don't do it. It is a waste of your time and money'...but I don't. I don't want to cause a scene, or start a barrage of backlash from people claiming that it worked for them. Instead, I will present the facts and let you decide for yourself if it is worth doing.\nBefore I start, I just want to clarify that when I am referring to detox I mean the ones that you buy where you have to take a million various tablets a day and stick to a very restricted diet. If you are going to 'detox' by simply eating healthily then all power to you. That will most definitely do wonders for your body. These detox kits won't. They will produce results; however, the results will be temporary.\nWhy detoxes don't work\nFirstly, the companies who are marketing the detoxes talk about removing toxins that have built up in the body. So, what are these toxins? They don't say. They remain vague and just leave you to let your imagination run wild. Do they mean chemicals, waste products from digestion, bacteria? I guess I imagined it as the waste products from digestion but it would be interesting to hear what other people perceive as the 'toxins' in their bodies.\nI read an interesting article on British Beauty Blogger about how Veet gave Chinese women a problem they never had. Chinese women naturally have very little body hair so hair removal products have always been poor sellers. Therefore, Reckitt Benckiser (who own Veet) devised  a marketing campaign to convince Chinese that any body hair is unsightly and released ads equating hair free skin with health, confidence and \"shining glory\" (the full marketing concept can be read here). I feel that this is the same as what is happening in regards to detoxes. The marketers of the products have convinced us that our bodies are full of these so called 'toxins', from our unhealthy lifestyles, that need to be removed with a detox.\nQuestion: What is a better alternative to detox kits?\nOptions:\n- getting plenty of sleep\n- healthy eating\n- exercise\n- not enough information",

        "I loved the little guy from the day she brought him home. She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath.\nMiss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \"Well honey? What do you think?\" And I told her: \"I love the little guy.\"\nHe was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man.\nSteve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame.\nHow did the narrator make Miss Tennessee grin?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- By teasing her\n- not enough information\n- Waiting with Steve in the car\n- Playing with Steve",

Ever since those first interactions we have become really close friends.\nToday Stuart turns 40 and I just wanted to share a few words about how remarkable a human being he is.\nMany of you who have listened to Stuart on Bad Voltage, seen him speak, worked with him, or socialized with him will know him for his larger than life personality. He is funny, warm, and passionate about his family, friends, and technology. He is opinionated, and many of you will know him for the amusing, insightful, and tremendously articulate way in which he expresses his views.\nHe is remarkably talented and has an incredible level of insight and perspective. He is not just a brilliant programmer and software architect, but he has a deft knowledge and understanding of people, how they work together, and the driving forces behind human interaction. What I have always admired is that while bombastic in his views, he is always open to fresh ideas and new perspectives. For him life is a journey and new ways of looking at the road are truly thrilling for him.\nAs I have grown as a person in my career, with my family, and particularly when moving to America, he has always supported yet challenged me. He is one of those rare friends that can enthusiastically validate great steps forward yet, with the same enthusiasm, illustrate mistakes too. I love the fact that we have a relationship that can be so open and honest, yet underlined with respect. It is his personality, understanding, humor, thoughtfulness, care, and mentorship that will always make him one of my favorite people in the world.\nQuestion: When did the author and Stuart become really close friends?\nAnswer:",

        "The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\nThe measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\"\nThe proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \"good cause,\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation.\nWhile marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea.\nThe legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller.\nMueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \"witch hunt.\"\nDespite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller. He told the cable show Fox and Friends on Thursday that he'll \"try and stay away\" from the Justice Department, but \"at some point, I...\nQuestion: Why was Trump critical of the FBI?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

        "When I was writing the manuscript for Florentine, I enlisted the help of an army of recipe testers \u2014 about 80 people from all over the world \u2014 to test every recipe thoroughly.\nOnly one came back to me consistently with problems.\nFrom Minnesota to Melbourne, three testers wrote to me that their very first attempt at making Tuscan gnudi (ricotta and spinach balls that, rather than be encased in pasta like for ravioli, are simply dusted in flour) resulted in a pot of simmering water with \u201cdissolved\u201d gnudi. It reminded me of Pellegrino Artusi\u2019s potato gnocchi recipe in his famous cookbook from 1891, where he interrupts the recipe instructions to mention a signora who, upon attempting to stir the gnocchi cooking in the pot, finds they have disappeared \u2013 O dove\u2019erano andati? \u201cWhere did they go?\u201d\nIn the case of the gnocchi, there was too little flour used, according to Artusi. But in the case of the gnudi, I already had a hunch. I grilled all three testers on a number of various factors \u2014 was the water just simmering, not on a rolling boil (which can destroy delicate gnudi), did they drain the spinach very well, and equally the ricotta (one said she even drained it overnight)? Did they use \u201cproper\u201d ricotta? Aha.\n\u201cProper\u201d ricotta. The kind that was only made a day or so earlier, the leftovers of the cheese-making process, the real deal. The kind that you can see in a deli counter, standing on its own, that gets cut into a big wedge and weighed when you order it. Not the kind you buy at the supermarket, in a tub, that so often is grainy, more like the consistency of yogurt, has no structure, and is full of unnecessary gums or additives. All my recipe testers had used the second kind \u2014 to be fair, some were new to the idea of buying ricotta and in their neighbourhood only had access to this. In that case, it would have probably been better to make your own, or choose another recipe.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: How experienced are the testers in making Italian food?\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- expert professional cooks\n- beginning cooks\n- previously cooked some Italian food based on other recipes",

        "It was a good feast. Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf.

        "Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter:\n\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\"\"\nAt the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand?\nI thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career.\nBack in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage.\nThe premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers.\nOpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. \ud83d\ude42 )\nSo, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant.\nI took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...\nWho heckled the writer when he was making a speech?\n- Paul Cooper\n- his editor\n- Scott Thompson\n- not enough information",

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source\u2019s ecosystem.\nI am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why.\nI find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said \u2018M$\u2019 instead of \u2018MS\u2019 (ugh.)\nThings have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there.

In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \"free and open\" Indo-Pacific region.\n\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\" Mattis said.\nSpecifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam.\n\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\" Mattis added.\nThough much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China.\nBeijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea.\nChina claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan.\nLast week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea.\nMattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \"initial response\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken.\n\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...\nQuestion: What event did the speech happen at?\nOptions:\n\nA.

This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side.\nOne truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot.\nAt this point, I was parallel with the shooter\u2019s truck and only about 50\u201360 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, \u201cOh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!\u201d\nI floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could.\nWhile he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information.\nAs it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter.\nI was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction.\nI lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other \u201croad rage stories\u201d, but this is still the craziest one.\nQuestion: After the end of this story, the driver is probably:\nOptions:\n\nA. glad\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. relieved\n\nD. tired\n\n===\nThe correct answer is",

It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough.\nAs the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn\u2019t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink.\nAt the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me.\nTo this day I\u2019m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn\u2019t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it.\nI woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend.\nShe eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart.

        "When Patch finally found his way out of the seed-pod, Toro was gone, and there were rats all around him. Some hid beneath the huge black seed-pods, some scuttled in the shadows of the nearby mountain. Patch knew from their smells there were at least a dozen of them.\nThere was another smell too, mixed with that of the rats. The very same unsavory squirrel-smell he had detected in Silver's abandoned drey.\n\"What do you want?\" Patch asked, from his perch atop the mound of seed-pods. He was concerned but not yet frightened. Rats and squirrels were neither friends nor enemies. Squirrels were bigger and stronger, but rats were far more numerous. There were legends of long-ago wars between the two species, but no squirrel Patch knew had ever been attacked by rats. Squirrels lived aboveground, in the sun; rats frequented the night and the dark underworld. Of course, squirrels found rats disgusting and disagreeable -- but so did all other animals.\nAn unusually large rat climbed up to the top of a seed-pod. It was almost as big as Patch himself. Rats usually avoided light, but this one stood unafraid beneath the sun, and demanded: \"Who are you?\"\n\"I am Patch son of Silver, of the Seeker clan, of the Treetops tribe, of the Center Kingdom,\" Patch said. \"Who are you that asks?\"\n\"I am Snout,\" the rat replied. \"Why are you here?\"\n\"I came to look for food.\"\n\"This is our food. These mountains are ours.\"\n\"Your food?\" Patch asked, bewildered. There was no ownership of food in the Center Kingdom, not until it had actually been eaten. \"That's ridiculous. It's food. It belongs to whoever finds it first.\"\n\"Then you belong to us,\" Snout hissed. \"Because we are the rats who will suck the marrow from your broken bones.\"\nQuestion: Who owns the food in the Center Kingdom?\nOptions:\n- Squirrels of The Treetops Tribe \n - Rats \n - Nobody \n - not enough information\n===\nThe correct answer is",

The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen.\nThere was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating.\nThe telephone rang before Ray was even half-finished with his cigarette.\n\"Admit it now, Ray.\" She sounded petulant.\n\"Fine, I admit it.

        "WASHINGTON \u2014 In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served.\nBut his freedom came with a price, something that didn\u2019t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office.\n\u201cAt the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn\u2019t understand the consequences,\u201d Meade says.\nFourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can\u2019t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration.\nHome to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state\u2019s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6.\nHe\u2019s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they\u2019ve completed the terms of their sentence.\nThe measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to change the system,\u201d Meade says confidently. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we\u2019re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.\u201d\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: Who got a law degree?\nOptions:\n- Meade\n- his wife\n- not enough information\n- the brother",

        "Out of boredom, two scientists from the New Contagious Diseases Research Centre devised themselves a new game. One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes.\nThey decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks.\nThe bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago.\nThe scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock.\nThe next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: The scientists believed that:\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB.

        "Read the following context and answer the question.\nContext: There is no hiding from the impact agenda. The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn\u2019t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers.\nIf you ever have a spare week, or ten, it\u2019s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/\u00a3millions.\nFor social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join \u201cnetworks\u201d and \u201ccommittees\u201d discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people \u2013 practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not.\nCentral to much of the impact is \u201caccess\u201d. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years. He didn\u2019t need much support. I advised and facilitated, but after 30 years in the game he knew Whitehall (and Holyrood) inside and out \u2013 and they knew him.

The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump\u2019s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda.

However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles.\nNielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other \u201csupport functions.\u201d She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include \u201cas many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.\u201d\nA senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective.\n\u201cSuffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,\u201d the official said.\nTrump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members.\nTrump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S.\nQuestion: Why did a senior Trump official claim that it would be an bad investment now for people looking to enter the US to pay a smuggler to gain entry?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

It was after midnight. So, she figured her new friend, Jason, was already dead. And so were her hopes of landing a secretarial job in time to keep her apartment. Rent was due on Tuesday, and she had just enough money to pay it. But then she'd have no money for food or gas or anything else.\nMaybe it was time to go home for a while. Surely she could put up with her mother for a few weeks while looking for work.\nShe opened her Favorites list and clicked on the link for The Orange Leader. Sondra had not been back to her home town in a long time, but she liked to keep up with what was going on there. Occasionally, she'd see one of her old classmates in a wedding announcement. Those people led real lives, and held real jobs. As a working musician, she lived in a completely different world. She had more in common with actresses than a secretaries.\nShe checked the Classifieds. Nurses wanted. Nope. Part-time receptionist.

She wished there had been such a place when she was growing up there.\nBut what really caught her eye was the note about auditions for a house band. It would play two hours a night, and earn $2,000 per week. Divided by four band members... Sondra could actually live on that! Not very well--but she could get by.

My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM\u2019s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me.

        "U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened tariffs on an additional $100 billion worth of Chinese goods, on top of the $50 billion in import taxes he already has proposed against Beijing. Though none of the tariffs have taken effect, it's the latest posturing in a trade dispute that some fear could escalate into a trade war.\nFor decades, Trump has complained about China's trade practices. One of his main complaints is what he calls Beijing's theft of U.S. intellectual property.\nLast month, Trump cited IP theft as justification for his proposed tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods. China retaliated by threatening its own tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods. Trump then escalated the dispute, saying he would consider tripling the amount of goods to which tariffs would be applied.\nChina gains access to U.S. technology by employing several tactics, which many observers have said are unfair or illegal.\nBeijing has long required that U.S. businesses transfer technology to Chinese companies as a precondition of entering the Chinese market. For instance, if you are a U.S. carmaker who wants to sell automobiles to China, Beijing requires that you team up with a local Chinese company, or face steep tariffs on imported vehicles.\n\nIn other cases, China requires U.S. companies to comply with localization requirements by storing sensitive data in the Chinese mainland. That increases the risk of intellectual property theft through means such as cyberattacks.It's difficult to quantify the value of technological knowledge. But according to an estimate last month by the U.S. trade representative, Chinese theft of American intellectual property costs between $225 billion and $600 billion every year.\nThat rate is unsustainable, said top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow. \"We can't afford to give up our technology,\" Kudlow said Friday. \"When they steal our technology ... they're stealing the guts of our American future.\"\nThe Chinese government has always denied carrying out the cyberattacks that frequently...\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What does China think of our technology?\nOptions:\n- They can probably copy it\n- It is very modern\n- not enough information\n- it will be obsolete soon",

One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled \u2018Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination\u2019. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: \u201cI would like filmmakers interested in thinking \u201coutside the box\u201d to recognize that they can benefit from being placed \u201cinside a box.\u201d I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio.\nThroughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to \u2018think more creatively\u2019. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological  and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states \u201ca genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work\u201d.\nConstraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their  projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...\nQuestion: who researched about constraints\nOptions:\n- the writers friend\n- the writer\n- a filmmaker\n- not enough information",

        "Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter:\n\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\"\"\nAt the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand?\nI thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career.\nBack in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage.\nThe premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers.\nOpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. \ud83d\ude42 )\nSo, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant.\nI took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...\nWhere was the author living when he heard about OpenAdvantage?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA.

I had two, one for staff accountant and the other was as accounting manager for a holistic health clinic. The clinic job paid about 40% more and came with a \u201cmanager\u201d title. I believed in myself and all that, but who offers someone just out of school with only 2 years of internship and no specialty in field manager level? That kept bugging me. Something just wasn\u2019t right.\nActing on instinct, I took the other job. Good thing! A few months later, I read that the owner of the clinic (an MD) and his two partners (his wife and the CFO) had all been indicted for numerous counts of fraud. They were cheating the state, they were cheating the church they were affiliated with, they were cheating Medicare and private insurance companies.\nThe IRS was after them \u2014 it was supposed to be not-for-profit but it turns out they were living large. Not only that, but they hadn\u2019t been sending in w/h tax for non-church member paid employees. Then there was the allegation that they were abusing mentally handicapped workers who were related to church members. The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic\u2019s Board of Directors.\nIt was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence. My job would have included filing false budget and financial statements with the Board, IRS and other agencies. I would have also probably known that they were withholding but not remitting tax from employee checks. Fact is, the poor kid who took the job got 2 years, so I found out.

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks.

This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia.\nThe trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren\u2019t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more \u201cserious\u201d health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary.\nPersonally, I don\u2019t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I\u2019ve found that the average person doesn\u2019t know enough to correctly choose among them.\nAlso, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it\u2019s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing \u2014 or worsening \u2014 an older person\u2019s constipation.\nFor instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those.\nIn short, if you\u2019re an older adult, or if you\u2019re helping an older...\nQuestion: Why do physicians often overlook constipation in the elderly?\nOptions:\n- because there are many OTC's for constipation \n - not enough information \n - because they are uneducated on constipation \n - because it is not a serious problem\n===\nThe correct answer is",

        "The dumbest thing that actually worked?\nI joined Tinder.\nReason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it\u2019s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn\u2019t have enough time to do something dumb.\nNow my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4\u20135 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird.\nWhen he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship.\nWhat he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to. If I hadn\u2019t have found his joke funny, he probably wouldn\u2019t have asked me out on a date.\nI hope that answers your question.

        "This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??).\nWhenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out.\nI have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now?\nQuestion: What does the writer probably think about others plucking grey hairs?\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. that doesn't make one grow back more hairs\n\nC. that will make you grow back darker hairs\n\nD. that will make them have lots of grey\n\n===\nThe correct answer is",

        "What are the worst examples of false advertising you've seen? Did you fall prey to their claims?\nRather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R.\nR was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories:\nShe wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \"miracle cure\" company who was along those lines! \"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts.\nShe received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham.\nAt which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\" Which is awesome.\nI still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally. But that's the most personally resonant version of false advertising affecting someone that I've seen.\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nAfter the end of this story, the patient is probably:",

It was a combination of a bad medication regimen and lots of little stressors\u2014school, work, a car accident, you name it. I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn\u2019t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead).\nOne night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account.\nI don\u2019t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn\u2019t specific, but rather something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to handle this.\u201d\nWhatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he\u2019d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me.\nI was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms. Whoever called saved me, but in a way I saved my own life that day. What I thought was just another routine post about stress got me the help I so desperately needed.

        "Bryan C. Keene and Alexandra Kaczenski of the Getty Museum\u2019s Manuscripts Department have spent the last few years preparing for an exhibition and publication titled Sacred Landscapes: Nature in Renaissance Manuscripts that aims to examine representations of \u201cgreen spaces\u201d such as gardens, vistas, and their relation to the divine.\nIn particular, Bryan and Alexandra focus on the ways in which artists during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance embedded the pages of illuminated manuscripts with depictions of the natural world so that nature could guide prayer, chant, and meditation.\nFor Bryan, this project represents a continuation of his interest in sacred gardens that began with his graduate work on the garden imagery that influenced Botticelli\u2019s Agony in the Garden painting. In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance.\nFor Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication.\nThough floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated\u2014the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented\u2014this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly \u201cscattered\u201d floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, \u201cThe tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific. Alex and I will continue to explore the potential meaning within this botanical and arboreal chaos.\u201d\nSacred...\nWho is Bryan Keene?\n- not enough information\n- worked on the exhibition Giovanni Bellini: Landscapes of Faith\n- works at the Getty Museum's Manuscripts Department\n- a scholar on Flemish manuscripts",

        "I will never own a Chanel suit. It is unlikely that I will ever own a (genuine) Chanel handbag. However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes ($AU39), they are still much more affordable than the $AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one).\nAfter seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted.\nI argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly $80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a $10 voucher for my birthday and I got a $30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For $38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite.\nGraphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect.

They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too.

We would have liked to have done it for less money, but building a F1 superphone doesn\u2019t come cheap (and remember that the $32million didn\u2019t include any costs for software engineering and project management\u2026Canonical were providing that for free). It was an ambitious target, but disrupting an industry is ambitious in itself, and we gave the crowd-funding campaign our best shot. The story does not end here though.\nI am not surprised that we didn\u2019t hit this ambitious $32million target, but I am surprised at what we did achieve. We broke all the crowd-funding records, garnered media attention across CNBC, Engadget, The Independent, TechCrunch, the BBC, T3, Stuff, The Verge, The Guardian, Wired, pandodaily, Fast Company, Forbes, The Telegraph and more. Every single person who put their support into the Ubuntu Edge campaign should be proud of their achievements and we are all thankful for your tremendous and inspiring support.\nOne thing to be critically clear about is that the Ubuntu convergence story does not end here. We are as voraciously excited and committed to bringing this Free Software convergence story to the world as ever before; our work with OEMs, Carriers, and ISVs continues apace. We have fantastic work going on across all fronts, and we are on track to have a 1.0 release of the Ubuntu Phone platform in October.\nWhat is probably true about the F1 superphone?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- it is a failure once produced\n- not enough information\n- it is an incredible invention\n- it is rejected by most people once produced",

Scores of demonstrators have been arrested, with one flash point being the southern city of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where DeRay McKesson, one of the most prominent activists linked to the police reform protest movement Black Lives Matter, live streamed his own arrest.\nPolice defended his arrest as a matter of public safety, but demonstrators told U.S. news outlets they believe McKesson was targeted.\nMcKesson was freed on bond Sunday afternoon after being charged with obstructing a highway. \"I remain disappointed in the Baton Rouge police, who continue to provoke protesters for peacefully protesting. There's a lot of work to be done, with this police department specifically,'' he said.\nBut Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards disagreed with McKesson's assessment. The governor told a news conference Sunday that he is proud of the state's law enforcement officers, calling their response to the protests \"moderate.\"\nIn the northern city of St. Paul, Minnesota, where a second man, Philando Castile, was shot to death last week by a policeman after a traffic stop for a broken tail light, hundreds of protesters hurled firecrackers, rocks and bottles at police on Saturday.\nThe heavily armed officers used smoke grenades and...\nWho disagreed with DeRay McKesson regarding the fairness of his arrest?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA.

But now I thought I might get some idea if I went down to where it was all happening, the being born and the dying. Mostly the dying. It was the dying that interested me.\nI sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \"guests\"; their families were \"guests\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad.\nI think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact. It reeked of spent emotions, and the emotions were made all the stronger, here in the green room, by the efforts at suppression--the muted walls and gourmet coffees and scones, the overstuffed loveseats and couches, as if those in grief should not be permitted to sit on benches or folding chairs. It absolutely reeked of hush and hidden feeling. It was worse than a church. It was worse than a highschool hallway. It was more universal, more basic, something even the children could comprehend.\nQuestion: When did the author see the coffee bar?\nOptions:\n- Before walking into the green room \n - not enough information \n - After walking into the green room \n - Before deciding to go to the hospital\n===\nThe correct answer is",

His mother\u2019s report card, one that prevented her from becoming a secondary school pupil in Glasgow, is filled with G and FG, until the last point: Character and conduct - excellent.\nWhat kind of pupils do we want to develop in Scotland?

The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \"rapid response\" to highlight any \"misstatements\" or \"contradictions,\" Fox News reports.\nComey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \"bright white half-moons\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.\n\nComey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.\n\nTrump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians.\nThe firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies.

        "Lanc\u00f4me Juicy Tubes changed my life.\nOk, well that\u2019s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I\u2019d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!).\nFast forward several (ahem\u2026) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there\u2019s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention \u2013 the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out \u2013 Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey.\nJuicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it\u2019s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses.\nShow Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it\u2019s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it\u2019s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.\nHow long did it probably take her to try more shades of Juicy Tubes?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. years\n\nB. forward\n\nC. not enough information\n\nD. several years",

        "The Trump administration's decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census divided Capitol Hill on Tuesday, with Democrats saying the addition could skew the results and alter millions in government funding, while some Republicans praised it as a \"commonsense\" move.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced late Monday the next effort to count every resident in the country will include a question about citizenship status. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the survey every 10 years, with the next set for 2020. The deadline for finalizing the questions is Saturday.\nIn a memo late Monday, Ross said he chose to include the query at the urging of the Department of Justice, which said it needed the citizenship data to better enforce a law protecting minority voting rights.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders defended the addition of the question, rejecting the notion that it might result in less federal aid to immigrant communities in the U.S. if immigrants are undercounted.\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill welcomed the decision, which revives a practice that was abandoned in 1950, after being in place for more than 100 years, according to the Commerce Department.\n\"It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy. A question on citizenship is a reasonable, commonsense addition to the census,\" Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement Tuesday.\nBut Democrats said the question would have the opposite effect \u2014 discouraging undocumented immigrants and citizen family members from responding to the census, undermining the accuracy of the results.\n\"We cannot accept an incomplete or unfair count in 2020 \u2014 too much is at stake,\" Rep. Carolyn Maloney, co-chair of the Congressional Census Caucus, told VOA. \"The census mandated by the [U.S.] Constitution affects the way that Federal and state funds are distributed and how district lines are drawn for both the city, state and Federal level.\"\nQuestion: When did the Trump admin add a question about citizenship to the census?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

But how much does this internal list define us?\nI believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: \u201cHow we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives\u201d. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it\u2019s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday.\nWithin my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of \u2018a day in the life\u2019. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of \u2018the everyday\u2019.\nTo create a sense of \u2018the day\u2019 or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses.\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nWho stated that how we spend our days is how we spend our lives?",

And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month.\n(Source)\nAs she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot. From giving 2 times food to giving clothes and giving bonuses on special occasion as much as Rs. 1000, they almost help her in each and every aspect. And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity.\nBut the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not.\nSo this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her.\nBut my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict.\nIf the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them.

A wall of bookcases dominated the living room, each shelf crammed with two, sometimes three layers of books, videotapes, CD's and DVD's. More stacks of books and magazines stood in every corner. Paul was certain they would have taken over all the other flat spaces as well, were it not for the half-assembled computers and three dusty old monitors occupying the coffee table, end tables, and everything in between. The only semi-open spaces were the two couches that faced each other from across the room. A large red and black checkered blanket covered one of them, while the other was cracked but still serviceable brown leather.

Come on into the kitchen and we'll rustle up a sandwich.\"\nPaul followed her back into the open kitchen area, which (given that he was ostensibly here to have lunch) he was relieved to see was clean. There was clutter in there certainly, but no dirty dishes or leftover foodstuffs appeared in evidence. Along the left wall was a cheap, plastic patio table with long wooden benches on each side and miss-matched chairs at either end.

The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that.\nPaul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees.

        "SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA \u2014 The conservative leader of South Korea\u2019s main opposition party on Thursday spoke out against the upcoming U.S.\u2013North Korea summit. He also voiced concern that political considerations are driving U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in to compromise joint security for more false denuclearization promises from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\u201cI am rather pessimistic about whether this negotiation will work out well or not. The only means for North Korea to maintain its regime is its nuclear program. The moment that North Korea gives up its nuclear program, and the moment it opens up to reform, the Kim Jong Un regime will collapse,\u201d said Hong Joon-pyo, the chairman of the Liberty Korea Party.\nOn June 12, Trump and Kim will meet in Singapore to try to reach an agreement to end the North\u2019s threatening nuclear weapons program in exchange for economic incentives and security guarantees that could include a formal peace treaty to replace the armistice that has been enforced since the end of the Korean War in 1953.\nMany South Korean conservatives had voiced strong support for Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d polices to force Pyongyang to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons through tough international sanctions in place that ban 90 percent of the country\u2019s trade, and the threat of military action.\nBut they have been troubled by recent statements coming from the Trump administration indicating the United States may be willing to soften its demands for the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement (CVID) of the North\u2019s nuclear program before offering any sanctions relief.\nHong is worried that Trump may seek a deal that would quickly end the North\u2019s intercontinental ballistic missile program that directly threatens the U.S., and leave the regional nuclear threat to be resolved later.\nTrump seems overly intent to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough, Hong said, to shift the media focus away from the ongoing special prosecutor investigation he is facing over Russia\u2019s...\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nAfter the end of the story, Trump probably:",

You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\"\nIn other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours.\nThe creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \"a local Amiga gaming championship\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest).\nThe school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member.\nDuring the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence.

        "The Getty Villa is a museum unlike any in the world. It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context.\nSince 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects\u2019 subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context.\nReenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture.\nStarting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor\u2019s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor\u2019s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: How long does a tour take?\nOptions:\n- 2 hours\n- about a week\n- fiteen minutes\n- not enough information",

Maybe it was my marriage, maybe it was my husband.\nI never wanted to be \u201cthat woman\u201c. The one that screwed around on her husband. But, I had an affair about six or seven years ago. It didn\u2019t last long. But, that\u2019s when I knew my marriage was over. It wasn\u2019t a lack of sexual desire, it was a lack of desire for my husband. I didn\u2019t want him or the marriage. There was nothing wrong with my sex drive.\nI told my husband that I\u2019d had an affair. He changed for about a month or so. He was very loving and attentive. But it didn\u2019t last. He loves differently than I need to be loved and it\u2019s just not in him to love me that way.\nA few months after I ended the affair, I got involved with someone else. I know.

Not flowers or candy or jewellery, but he talks and listens. He hears me. He tries to understand me and give me what I need. Deep, intimate conversations. Looking into one another\u2019s eyes. Soft caresses. Words of adoration. These things he gives me almost daily.\nI never knew I needed romance because I\u2019d never had it. This is how I need to be loved.\nAfter having felt this way, I can\u2019t stay in my marriage.

Go for a minimum of an overnight stay, or a few days if you can.

It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success.\nAdd a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine\nA simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities \u2013 the things you are going to do anyway.\nFor example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster.\nAs you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories.\nWhen it\u2019s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can \u2013 stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal.\nWhen you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song \u2013 make those tiles shine.\nPlay fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum.\nWork for longer periods of time \u2013 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there. It gives you more time to get your heart rate going and a better boost to your metabolism.\nThese are things you can do to keep your house sparkling and build the new you. So, start throwing in an abundant amount of gusto for extra calorie burning and body shaping.\nQuestion: What is bothering the reader?\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB.

In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being \u2018creative\u2019, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative?\nThis is where creativity get\u2019s tricky.\nIt\u2019s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it\u2019s easy to investigate it, but what if you don\u2019t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us.\nMaybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work.\nMaybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work.\nMaybe for you creativity doesn\u2019t have to involve any hard work at all.\nFor me when it comes to creativity I\u2019m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from?\nIs it simply random?\nIs it a gift from the gods?\nIs our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a \u2018random\u2019 idea?\nHave we been influenced by something, processed it...\nWhat is probably true about the narrator\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- He is a follower\n- not enough information\n- He is a writer\n- He is a simple person",

        "Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.\nContext: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair.\nTaken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to \u201cthe more the better\u201d.\nSo how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.\nBut the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The \u201crecreational athlete\u201d, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range.\nSo how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special \u201chigh protein\u201d training diet.\nSportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it\u2019s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone.\nThis has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that\u2019s before using any protein powders.\nBut protein supplements can\u2019t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule.\nQuestion: The author of this article probably does what as a hobby?\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB.

Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women\u2019s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said \u201cWhatever doesn\u2019t kill me, makes me stronger\u201d.\nHow did I cope with it? Mostly alone.

I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I\u2019d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped.

She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour. In any case, as he rounded the corner at the top of the hill, the road was apparently free of snow and ice and there was no reason to slowdown. Until the moose stepped out onto the road just ahead of them.\nQuestion: what I responded to mrs D\nOptions:\n\nA. I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill\n\nB.

Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of.\nThe key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality.\nDigging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn\u2019t cardiovascular disease they were dying from.

It shows four different food groups and the optimal number of servings of each group that should be consumed.\nThe pyramid was created based on research of the diet that the people in the Mediterranean countries consume. The area was selected as the model because of the low incidence of heart disease and high life expectancy found in the region.\nOne of the primary reasons for the healthy results of the diet is that the people not only use fresh, unadulterated ingredients, they also cook their meals in very healthy ways.\nThey are among the minority of the world\u2019s population that have not embraced the fast food culture that dominates the US and Australia. It should be noted that both countries are battling an obesity epidemic.\nThere are no processed foods, colas, white flour products, pizzas or any unhealthy food in the food pyramid. There are only categories of fresh, healthy foods: fruits and vegetables, nuts and grains, beans, fish and seafood, and healthy oils (primarily olive oil) \u2013 plus a little red wine.\nYour fat consumption should be moderate along with consumption of dairy products such as yogurt and cheese. Eggs can be consumed daily.\nFish (seafood) is preferred over meat and should be consumed twice a week. Poultry is also preferred over red meat and should be consumed once a week.

        "WASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government\u2019s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than $100,000 for unspecified expenses.\nIn his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had \u201cfully reimbursed\u201d his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of $100,000 to $250,000 in 2016.\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for $130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier.\nTrump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop \u201cfalse and extortionist accusations\u201d made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment.\nThe disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a \u201creportable\u201d liability, Trump chose to list it \u201cin the interest of transparency.\u201d It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president\u2019s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn\u2019t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year.\nThe Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met \u201cthe disclosure requirements for a reportable liability\u201d under the Ethics in Government Act.\nUnder the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of $10,000 during the previous reporting period. \u201cKnowingly or willfully\u201d falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report.\nCritics seized on...\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: Trump probably feels how about being accused of sexual misconduct?\nOptions:\n\nA. indifferent\n\nB. mad\n\nC. proud\n\nD. not enough information",

        "Once, while grating potatoes to make potato pancakes, I had a Proustian moment. I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine r\u00e2p\u00e9e', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement. Because we were cheap labour, the kids would be sent down to retrieve a few for the family meal. It was creepy to descend into the dank cellar, feel our way through the dim obstacle course formed by my grandfather's thousands of tools and bits of wood and locate the bin. After a time in storage, the eyes on potatoes began to sprout pale tendrils and it didn't take much imagination to visualize all kinds...\nQuestion: poutines are considered?\nOptions:\n\nA. fancy food\n\nB. a religious food\n\nC. peasant food\n\nD. not enough information\n\n===\nThe correct answer is",

        "Have you ever wondered whether it\u2019s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising?\nIn 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of \u201csuccessful aging\u201d health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.)\nDuring the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)?\nThat\u2019s right. When it came to avoiding \u201cmajor mobility disability\u201d \u2014 which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more \u2014 a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education.\nSpecifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program.\nThis is a very encouraging finding! That said, it\u2019s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more.\nIn this post, I\u2019ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.\nWant to know how often the exercisers experienced \u201cadverse events\u201d?

At the end of this post, I\u2019ll share my list of key take-home points for older adults and family caregivers.\nWho were the study volunteers?

She blu-tacked page threes above her bed-head and had me snap topless Polaroids till they littered the floor. She told me to imagine she had 36DDs and peroxide blonde hair. I used to wish like hell that she wasn't my cousin. When she was fifteen Trisha started putting out for the boys in the Kwik-Save car park for a tenner a time. She said she was an entrepreneur, not a prostitute. She started going steady with a kid called Keith. He was a fryer in the fish and chip shop. He had a future and a Ford Cortina. She got a job waitressing and she worked all the hours she could. Keith couldn't handle me and Trisha being as close as we were. Especially the time he caught Trisha bending over me in nothing but a frilly market stall thong while I worked the angles best I could to get a dangle-shot. Next night he took her in the car park woods and doped her up to the eyeballs. He took out a bottle of India ink and told her he would etch the love-heart she'd always wanted. Instead, he safety-pinned the word 'inbred' into her arse. Trisha's step-dad tracked the spits of blood and found her sobbing in the bathroom of their long-stay static. It didn't take him long to slap out the truth. He went straight round to Keith's place with a crow-bar and did enough damage to make sure he'd need more than laser treatment to put things right. Keith wasn't rolling in spare change so Trisha's step-dad took the Cortina as payment in lieu of her getting herself fixed up. Trisha got me to stash the Cortina up the lane at the back of Boyes' farm. Weekend nights, I drove her out to the dual carriageway truck-stop where she found a faster way to make her fortune in the fogged-up cabs.\nQuestion: How long did it take Trisha's step-dad to slap out the truth?\nOptions:\n\nA. a few minutes\n\nB. a day\n\nC. a few hours\n\nD. not enough information",

I do not want to go on, stumbling through this world alone.\nFor years these people had been her only family. When she was a child, her faith was preached and practiced openly all over the south of France. The crusade was already twenty years old then, but the perfecti still taught crowds of people in the streets of great cities like Toulouse and Beziers, still won converts away from the Church of Rome. From the lords and ladies in their castles to the peasants on the mountainsides, over half the people were Cathars. Now this year, one thousand two hundred forty-four, might come to be remembered as the year Catharism in France disappeared. From now on there would be nothing but a remnant in hiding, having to sneak about. No, she didn't want to live that way.

The president had his share of victories and setbacks amid a backdrop of Twitter storms and, at times, raging rhetoric.\nTrump's political base seems pleased with his first year in office, touting his efforts to cut Obama-era regulations, install Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and roll back Islamic State forces in the Middle East.\n\"We were kind of thinking we were going to relax and put Trump behind us and just watch all the great promises that he gave us, and watch him make America great again,\" said Michigan Trump supporter Meshawn Maddock. \"But what happened immediately is that we felt he was under attack from day one.\"\nThe president's biggest legislative victory came just last month, a sweeping tax cut bill that had been a Republican priority for years. \"We are very proud of it,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed it. \"It is going to be a tremendous thing for the American people. It is going to be fantastic for the economy.\"\nIn fact, there are plenty of signs of a surging economy, and public opinion polls show growing support for Trump's handling of it and even a bump up in support for the tax bill, which many voters saw initially as too favorable to the wealthy.\nThe tax victory also seems to be helping Trump galvanize the Republican Party behind him, even those who in the past have been cool to his leadership.\n\"This president hasn't even been in office for a year, and look at all the things he has been able to get done, by sheer will in many ways,\" said Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, who also announced recently he would not run for re-election this year.\nQuestion: after the end of the story what do the Republicans think about the tax changes Trump makes?\nOptions:\n\nA.

        "In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time.\nThe payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort.\nDavid Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following:\nDoing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency \u2013 and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality.\nMany studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress \u2013 which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix.\nImagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles.\nThe mind is the same.\nThe more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task.\nThe more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become.\nBut . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand.\nLet your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the \u201ctop-of-mind\u201d because everything that happens...\nQuestion: What in the article is mentioned as becoming slower while multitasking?\nOptions:\n- The mind \n - Time \n - not enough information \n - Coordination\n===\nThe correct answer is",

Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled.\nA mother\u2019s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn\u2019t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning.\nMy usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day.\nSo I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden.\nInside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son.\nBetter mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children.

If Moore wins, Republicans will retain their 52-48 majority in the Senate, but a Jones victory would pare the margin to 51-49, possibly further complicating Trump's efforts to pass his legislative agenda.\nPre-election polls at various times have shown both Moore, 70, and Jones, 63, in the lead, but the history of elections in deeply conservative Alabama runs against Jones.\nNo Democrat has won a Senate election in the state since Richard Shelby did in 1992, and two years later he switched parties to become a Republican. Still a senator, Shelby said Sunday that he voted absentee for \"a distinguished Republican\" as a write-in choice, but could not bring himself to vote for Moore after one woman, now in her 50s, said Moore abused her when she was 14.\nMoore, twice deposed as a state Supreme Court justice for failing to follow federal court rulings, has accused journalists, Democrats and establishment Republicans in Washington of trying to undermine his campaign. Some Republican lawmakers, a number of whom said Moore should drop out of the contest after the women's allegations surfaced, said they would try to expel him from the Senate if he won.\nQuestion: What is probably true of Sessions?\nOptions:\n\nA.

Or maybe it did?\nThe first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie\u2019s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie\u2019s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell\u2019s script and getting any other shots we needed to get.\nPerhaps we didn\u2019t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn\u2019t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn\u2019t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I\u2019m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects.

As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film \u2013 but with them as stands in \u2013 just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of...\nWhat is probably true about the narrator?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. he loves making films\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. he hates making films\n\nD. he wants to be an actor",

        "Once, while grating potatoes to make potato pancakes, I had a Proustian moment. I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine r\u00e2p\u00e9e', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement. Because we were cheap labour, the kids would be sent down to retrieve a few for the family meal. It was creepy to descend into the dank cellar, feel our way through the dim obstacle course formed by my grandfather's thousands of tools and bits of wood and locate the bin.

Its name was Dogland. Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled.

I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes.

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\"\"\nAt the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand?\nI thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career.\nBack in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage.\nThe premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers.\nOpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. \ud83d\ude42 )\nSo, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant.\nI took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: Why did the writer probably take the job with OpenAdvantage?\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB.

Trump said he felt U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \"Mexican heritage,\" would not rule fairly in the case that charged Trump with fraud.

        "President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January.\nBut even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction.\nThe recent plea deal between Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed.\nTrump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises.\nHouse and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support.\nTrump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs.\n\u201cI will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,\u201d Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. \u201cThere has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.\u201d\nDemocrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it.\n\u201cIt rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,\u201d warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.\nDespite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump\u2019s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president.\nQuestion: The Michael Flynn plea deal:\nOptions:\n- not enough information \n - occurred after the tax cuts \n - has not happened yet \n - occurred before the tax cuts\n===\nThe correct answer is",

        "And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension.\nSince this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I\u2019m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family.\nBy the way, if you\u2019ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines.\nThe core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same:\n* Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here),\n* Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014,\n* And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control.\nPerhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers \u201cdiminishing returns\u201d as we treat BP to get lower and lower.\nScientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150).\nFrom there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120.\nHowever, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.)\nQuestion: What event led the author to write an article about blood pressure?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand.\nIt was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been.\nPerhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right?\nThe living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him. Not that it ever stopped them.\n\"I hear that you are unhappy,\" he said into the phone, then had to pull the receiver away from his ear so the woman on the other end could scream at him some more.\nConflict de-escalation technique number one was invariably affirmation. Make it clear that you are aware of the individual's feelings and frustrations, that you are at least listening to their side, whether or not you personally may eventually have the authority to validate or alleviate those feelings.

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones.\nI had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20\u2019s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium.\nThe counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints.\nThere was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others.

        "Thanks for the A2A Josh:\nTough one to reduce to just a single incident but I\u2019ll try.\nI grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s.\nMy family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses.\nMy dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between.\nIt was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed.\nAs I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway.\nSome people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools.\nI remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether.\nI don\u2019t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn\u2019t do a good job.\nLater in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing.\nI still remember hating shoveling snow. But I\u2019m forever grateful that I did it.\nQuestion: What did his dad do for a living?\nOptions:\n- worked in a factory \n - not enough information \n - worked in a restaurant \n - worked in a school\n===\nThe correct answer is",

        "This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??).\nWhenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out.\nI have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it?

His country would be very rich.\u201d Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House.\nPresident Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants.\nBut the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North\u2019s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors.\nWhere will Trump meet with Kim Jung Un?\n- not enough information\n- North Korea\n- South Korea\n- Singapore",

His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases.\nIt's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014.\nHowever in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs.\nFailing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders.\nUnder the Constitution, the president has the power to grant \u201cpardons for offenses against the United States\u201d or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction.\nThe American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...\nQuestion: What was obamas position during this ordeal\nAnswer:",

The gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen and the son of Afghan parents.\nIn her first speech since the shooting, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told supporters in Cleveland, \"The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive.\"\nClinton laid out a multi-faceted approach to combating terrorism. The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe.\nIn an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \"radical\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\"\nDoing so, she said, \"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh.\nClinton called for citizens to reach out to Muslims in the United States \"to help us defeat this threat.\" She cited the need for \"common sense reform\" of gun ownership laws, including a ban on assault weapons.\nAfter Obama did not use the term \"radical\" in his remarks Sunday from the White House, Trump criticized Obama's approach to extremism and said the president \"should step down.\"\nTrump, meanwhile, renewed a call for a ban on the entry of Muslim immigrants into the United States.\n\"The only reason the killer was in America in the first place was we allowed his family to come here,\" Trump said in a speech to supporters in Manchester, New...\nQuestion: who cited the need for common sense reform of gun ownership laws\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- Clinton\n- Trump\n- Obama",

Imagine. If you will. A large rather expensive hotel. Then add to that image a rather drunk and buxom young lady who is lying on the floor in a drunken slumber after taking off a lot of her clothes. She was just in her underwear. We were called to look after her. On our arrival she was absolutely fine. Stood up, walked to the stretcher and lay down. Whining about how we were the ' oppressors of society', and other such drivel Because I had the cheek to try and give her a tiny bit of dignity by covering her up with a blanket. She didn't want that. We made it to the ambulance without any hassle and started to do the necessary checks we do on every patient. Blood pressure etc etc when out of the blue she decided that she wanted to release her rather large breasts.

However, there will still be opportunities for interactions between Trump and his Latin and North American counterparts at the two-day summit that begins April 13 in Lima, Peru.\nThe gathering takes place as Trump finalizes plans to send the military to the U.S. border with Mexico and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. In addition, Trump's recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have sparked criticism from many of the attendees at the summit, though some countries have received temporary exemptions.\nDespite all the turbulence, White House officials outlined a fairly traditional agenda for the summit.\n\"A win for this president at this summit will be a strong speech focused on regional governance, leadership on Venezuela and promoting reciprocal trade,\" a senior administration official said.\nThe official would not say whether Trump will continue to \"speak his mind\" during the summit on sensitive issues such as immigration.\nTrump has repeatedly portrayed immigration from South and Central America as both a national security and economic threat. During his presidential campaign, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists, drug dealers and criminals across the border.\nTrump has also clashed with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over the funding of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The president has long insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall.\nThe disagreement become so heated earlier this year that Pena Nieto canceled plans to visit the White House. It is not clear whether Trump will hold a one-on-one meeting with Pena Nieto during the summit, U.S. officials said.\n\nBut Trump will not meet with Cuban leader Raul Castro or anyone from the Venezuelan delegation, White House officials said.\n\"Obviously the Cubans will be participating in the summit, so there will be a mixing of regional...\nWhat does Nieto believe?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- The US is mostly a good partner\n- not enough information\n- The US is a good partner\n- The US is unreasonable",

        "SEOUL \u2014 Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost $20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12.\n\u201cThe hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It\u2019s going to be a multiyear long process,\u201d said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington.\nPresident Trump has said he expects a \"very positive result\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North\u2019s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\"\nThis position aligns closer to the Kim government\u2019s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president\u2019s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered.\nNorth Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years.\nWith such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost $20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy.\nKwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals...\nWho believes the June 12 summit will be the beginning of a process to resolve differences?\n\nA.

She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath.\nMiss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \"Well honey?

They\u2019re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that. Our research finds that whilst nobody is immune to these pressures, some academics cope better than others \u2013 and that\u2019s because over the years, they\u2019ve developed personal \u201csystems\u201d to help them write.\nWe recently carried out in-depth interviews with 23 scholars across the UK, Europe and the US. We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts.\nWe did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko \u2013 a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common \u201chabits\u201d that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use.\n1. They \u201ctime-block\u201d their writing in advance\nScheduling \u2013 booking in time to write in advance \u2013 was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn\u2019t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week.\nWhat seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing \u2013 and so made the process easier and less stressful.\n\u201cWhen I need to write I block out time. I\u2019m lucky in that I can work from home \u2013 I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand. I couldn\u2019t really write in any other way than blocking out that time.\u201d\nQuestion: What issue did the author address first with their time block research?\nOptions:\n- Personal systems\n- not enough information\n- Publishing\n- Scheduling",

The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day.\nWear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange \u2014 the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others.\nWhile the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \"pointless,\" and said \"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\"\nHere is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns.\nAny law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun.\nThat right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"\nThe Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state.\nTo purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record.\nHowever, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows.\nCertain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.\nQuestion: After the events of the story, the NRA still:\nOptions:\n\nA. harshly criticizes and attacks members of the Wear Orange political movement.\n\nB. is critical and wary of any political movements that call for political change on the topic of gun rights.\n\nC. not enough information\n\nD. is unwilling to compromise and agree to any law or reform that compromises the right to own guns.",

Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back.

        "This week could turn out to be pivotal for the Trump White House as both major parties get ready for midterm congressional elections in November.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November.\nTrump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign.\n\u201cIf you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,\u201d Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, \u201cBuild the wall!\u201d\nJust hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House.\n\u201cWe are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,\u201d he said.\nTrump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.\nAlso driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica.\nThe separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats.\n\u201cWe should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,\u201d said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. \u201cWhat country is that? This is the United States of America!\u201d\nAdvocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings.\nAccording to the above context, answer the following question.\nAt the end of the story, Elijah Cummings probably is",

I met his personal valet from the white house mess, Oscar, and he casually said, if you are ever in DC\u2026.\nTo which I replied, I sure can be! My husband and I made the trip a month or so later, we met up with Oscar for dinner on our first night there. We had just started planning all we wanted to see as it was our first visit there. We had no idea that Oscar would invite us for not one but two private tours of the White House. We saw the oval office, the situation room, the rose garden, the mess, the press room and the OEOB. We even heard Buddy bark! It was a trip I knew I\u2019d never be able to repeat and was very grateful to have had the chance to take.\nFor the fun one\u2026My friend was turning 50 and she wanted a theme destination celebration. 18 of us went to Belize. She went all out. Two private villas that you could only access by boat, all the swag you can imagine. And plenty of booze.

I too am a Disney fan!\nQuestion: Why did the narrator choose to recount two separate events?\nOptions:\n\nA. Because the two events are explicitly related\n\nB. Because both trips had special twists and they wanted to talk about both\n\nC. Because the narrator was not certain on the contextual meaning of \"best\"\n\nD. not enough information",

        "Read the following context and answer the question.\nContext: Lanc\u00f4me Juicy Tubes changed my life.\nOk, well that\u2019s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I\u2019d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!).\nFast forward several (ahem\u2026) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there\u2019s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention \u2013 the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out \u2013 Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey.\nJuicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it\u2019s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses.\nShow Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it\u2019s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it\u2019s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.\nQuestion: What product is probably the author's favorite of all the Juicy Tubes?\nAnswer:",

        "So this thing happened today.\nI am living in a society where there are almost 90 houses and almost all of them are occupied. We have one sweeper hired for whole society to collect waste and sweep out dust from our society roads.\nBTW her name is Hira masi (my brother calls her diamond masi :p). And she is extremely poor and she lives in those slums where almost nothing is available. She earns 50/100 per house each month.\n(Source)\nAs she is extremely poor, all the society people help her a lot.

And this is by far the most incredible thing our society has which is humanity.\nBut the twist comes here. On the other side, she is extremely cunning. She rarely cleans the road, takes rarely wastes from homes, gives excuses that she is sick and does not come for work, etc. She does not do her work properly. She also request money from us saying that her family members are ill as much as Rs 10000, even if they are not.\nSo this thing was discussed in our meeting and there some decided to continue her as she was very poor and some decided to leave her.\nBut my mom today told me a great thing- If a person is doing her work seriously, then we will surely help him in every way, even if it is a matter of money, but the person who is not sincere and not doing work properly, then sometimes we have to step back from humanity and be strict.\nIf the person is honest and he is REALLY in need of help, we should definitely help them.

        "My daughter was away at college preparing for her final exams and nursing boards. I knew that my daughter\u2019s cat, who has been part of our family since my daughter was in second grade, was dying of a fast growing cancer. I couldn\u2019t tell my daughter because I didn\u2019t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred. I thanked her for the 14 years she had been one of my daughter\u2019s closest companions and I held her as she took her last breath.

        "In the 1970s I was a student nurse in psychiatry. I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet.\nOne of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, \u201cYou think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!\u201d as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse.\nI worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved.\nI was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been.\nIt is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her.\nHow long ago or what estimated year did this episode occur?\n- not enough information\n- In the 1970s\n- After the 1970s\n- Before the 1970s",

It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough.\nAs the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn\u2019t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself.

Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated.\nTuesday\u2019s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea.\nTrump called the agreement \u201cvery comprehensive,\u201d but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington\u2019s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang\u2019s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress.\nSome in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program.\n\u201cNorth Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement.

        "Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean.\nSo far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless.\nOne of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn\u2019t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I\u2019ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls.\nFor the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better.\nPrior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don\u2019t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I\u2019ve washed it. I have tried the \u2018reverse poo\u2019 method which helps a bit \u2013 this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second \u2013 but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.\nQuestion: When did the writer want to try out another variant?\nOptions:\n\nA. before using Rescue Duo\n\nB. after using Rescue Duo\n\nC. not enough information\n\nD. in 2013\n\n===\nThe correct answer is",

As you slid your finger down the columns of groceries and toiletries, you would invariably be stopped by something along the lines of \"2dozjumHerbal Essences\" or \"1pepperoni TC,\" with the \"TC\" underlined twice and flanked by gnarled masses of pencil scratch-outs. When we were kids, we dreaded accompanying her to Wal-Mart, or worse, the Cosco at the edge of town, where the echoing rafters and limitless aisles seemed to mock the confusion into which we were inevitably thrown when handed torn-off fragments of the list. Of course, it was easy enough to see in hindsight that \"2dozjumHerbal Essences\" was merely the bastard child of two drunkenly weaving columns--we had been supposed to get two dozen jumbo eggs and a bottle of my mother's favourite brand of shampoo (ever inventive in creating proprietary abbreviations--\"TC\" standing for, what else, thin crust pizza--my mother scrupulously wrote out brand names in full).\nIt was a little like ordering chemicals for a laboratory, sans any knowledge of chemistry--or, for that matter, laboratories, although my ignorance of the distinction between baking soda and baking powder cannot be entirely the root of my confusion. Eventually I--and my siblings--learned the difference between tomato paste and tomato sauce, and could readily distinguish one brand of laundry detergent from a similarly-styled knock-off, but my shame-faced trips back to the mothercart never ceased.

        "Trisha dreamed of being a Playboy Bunny since the days she still had buck-teeth and fried egg boobs. She blu-tacked page threes above her bed-head and had me snap topless Polaroids till they littered the floor. She told me to imagine she had 36DDs and peroxide blonde hair. I used to wish like hell that she wasn't my cousin. When she was fifteen Trisha started putting out for the boys in the Kwik-Save car park for a tenner a time. She said she was an entrepreneur, not a prostitute. She started going steady with a kid called Keith. He was a fryer in the fish and chip shop. He had a future and a Ford Cortina. She got a job waitressing and she worked all the hours she could. Keith couldn't handle me and Trisha being as close as we were. Especially the time he caught Trisha bending over me in nothing but a frilly market stall thong while I worked the angles best I could to get a dangle-shot. Next night he took her in the car park woods and doped her up to the eyeballs. He took out a bottle of India ink and told her he would etch the love-heart she'd always wanted. Instead, he safety-pinned the word 'inbred' into her arse. Trisha's step-dad tracked the spits of blood and found her sobbing in the bathroom of their long-stay static. It didn't take him long to slap out the truth. He went straight round to Keith's place with a crow-bar and did enough damage to make sure he'd need more than laser treatment to put things right. Keith wasn't rolling in spare change so Trisha's step-dad took the Cortina as payment in lieu of her getting herself fixed up. Trisha got me to stash the Cortina up the lane at the back of Boyes' farm. Weekend nights, I drove her out to the dual carriageway truck-stop where she found a faster way to make her fortune in the fogged-up cabs.\nQuestion: what does the author think of keith?\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs?\nIt also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin\u2026with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper?\nA Lesson on Creating Self Portraits\nWhether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old\u2019s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.)\nThe teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait.\nGather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it.\nNarrate the process as you walk through the steps.\n\u201cI am going to draw a picture of myself.

        "I was lucky enough to get three acne skincare packs from Aphelia Cosmetology for guest reviewers with acne to trial for me. I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people.\nIn the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck.\nHere is Nalini's review:\nI've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless.\nIn my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit.\nAs a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'.

Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it\u2019s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don\u2019t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C\u2019est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here).\nFor some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there.\nOnline tickets cost quite a bit more (27\u20ac compared to 12\u20ac for adults and 10\u20ac for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5\u20ac.\nIt\u2019s a nice cool 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above.

The university has been described as an \u201canxiety machine\u201d: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now \u201cconsumers\u201d), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit \u2013 such as the REF and TEF \u2013 to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour.\nIn 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts \u2013 a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities \u2013 such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance \u2013 \u201ccasualised\u201d contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...\nHow do education workers probably feel about their work environment?\n- They feel comfortable with the pressures they have at work\n- They are frustrated with their situation\n- not enough information\n- They are happy with the amount of oversight they have",

For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: Why did Barend's shadow caught the narrator's eye?\nOptions:\n- Because he was a boring kid\n- Because he wore faded jeans\n- He had the most incredible shadow\n- not enough information",

Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to \u201cTake down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!\u201d\nTrump\u2019s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix.\nIn his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump \u201cmay not mind being isolated\u201d the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves.\n\u201cAmerican jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,\u201d Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. \u201cWhen we can underscore this, and we see that there\u2019s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.\u201d\n\u201cA trade war doesn\u2019t spare anyone,\u201d Macron said. \u201cIt will start to hurt American workers.

You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney\u2019s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes.\nThe teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018.\nThe Getty\u2019s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning?\nTo address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2)\nThe Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems.\nQuestion: When did the Getty Teen Lab start?\nAnswer:",

The clash of metal rang through the forest. An arrow pierced through the darkness, its barbed head tearing through flesh and muscle. A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard.

Char turned towards Ranur. \"Are you hurt?\" \"Mm...My hand.\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound.

        "A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words!\nQuestion: After emerging from his drey, Patch:\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

Shaking the object is definitely not encouraged.\nBut that\u2019s exactly what we\u2014a group of museum curators and conservators\u2014did when this exquisite Greek black-glazed kantharos (wine cup) was temporarily removed from display during the reinstallation of the Getty Museum\u2019s antiquities collection at the Getty Villa. One of just a handful of \u201crattling cups\u201d that survive from the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., we wanted to learn more about how it was made.(1) Although we were eager to find out what was below the surface of the cup, we started by examining its exterior.\nThe kantharos\u2019s distinctive shape, with profiled lip, tall foot, and elegant, upward-sweeping handles, is characteristic of black-glazed pottery made in the second half of the fourth century B.C., and replicates the form of luxury vessels in metal. Although the cup is currently catalogued as South Italian, the shape\u2014and its striking decoration\u2014are also typical of Athenian manufacture, and it may in fact have been produced there.(2) During the fourth century B.C., Athenian pottery was both imported into southern Italy and imitated by local craftsmen. The best South Italian versions were meant to be difficult to distinguish from Athenian examples, and we are continuing to investigate where ours may have been made.\nA Greek inscription applied in gilt around the rim reads: \u039a\u0391\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u03a1\u03a0\u039f\u039b\u03a5\u0394\u0395\u03a5\u0399\u039a\u0395\u03a3 (\u201cKASTORPOLYDEUIKES\u201d). Kastor and Polydeukes were twin sons of Zeus\u2014known together as the Dioskouroi\u2014and were worshipped as protectors of sailors, horsemen, and chariot racing.(3) The inscription indicates that the kantharos was dedicated to them, perhaps as thanks for\u2014or in hope of\u2014safe passage at sea or a successful race. The gold decoration supports this idea: because each brother split his time between Mt. Olympus and Hades, they were often represented by stars, depicted here beneath the cup\u2019s rim.

We won't miss anything.\nThe sound of clacking gradually fills the room as my brother reluctantly turns up the volume. I can tell he's pressing hard on the button, jamming his thumb down in defiance or muted anger. He doesn't like for anyone to tell him what to do with the remote. But my grandmother wants the volume up, so we turn it up.\nWe're all sitting along the edges of the tiny living room, staring at the fuzzy black-and-white images as they hazily walk across the television screen.

Uncle Arehl (I don't know precisely whose uncle he is, or for what the two initials of his name once stood) saunters slowly across a dry, patchy lawn, and the camera follows him. For some reason I'm more interested in the lawn--if it can be called that--than in the people on it. The sun in the movie is blazing, and everyone filmed looks only briefly at the camera before averting their faces once again to look at the stubbly grass. The camera pans once again and I can see an incredibly rutted path leading from the porch to the fence at the edge of the yard, broken pieces of concrete amid deep tire tracks fossilized in sun-baked mud. The fence is low, wire like a chain-link, but lower, with metal stakes holding it up instead of tubes.\nQuestion: Who is the oldest person in the room>?\nOptions:\n- not enough information\n- The grandmother\n- The brother\n- The narrator",

        "A prospective client sent me a link to this in-depth article on IBM's design thinking revolution, where Phil Gilbert, IBM's General Manager of Design, has hired over 1000 designers into the firm, and pushed for over 8000 of its managers and staff to get 'trained' in design thinking. They have even created specific design centres across the firm, with design offices in most of its key locations, such as the one above. The goal is nothing short of beginning IBM's next phase of transformation, one of many in its 100+ year history.\nHowever, all is not rosy. Despite achieving a monumental success relative to the status quo, 8000 'recognised' design thinkers in a corporation of over 370,000 souls is barely a dent in terms of changing practice. If NoTosh were to effect change in only 2% of the teachers with whom we work, we'd have packed up our bags long ago.\nI'm not sure hiring 1000 designers in and of itself is the answer to any organisation trying to instil a different way of viewing the world. Here's why.\nSince design thinking really began to be a thing, back in the early 60s, the designer him or herself has consistently been at the centre of the design process. Even though we talk of 'user-centred design', the actual ideation and production of a solution, and in many cases the synthesis and definition of the problem to be solve, too, are all tasks undertaken by skilled 'designers', rather than the people in the organisation who have the scope, brand, or 'permission' to play in that space. Once the designers leave the project, so does the design thinking.\nThere is a reason d.school sees its executive courses filled with repeat customers and firms like IDEO continue to thrive - they are resolving challenges in specific examples of services or products, but not necessarily transforming the firms and organisations who had the budget and desire to solve a problem in that specific area. Solving a problem costs money. Solving a problem and teaching the client how to do it again and again costs more than just money....\nWhat did Gilbert aim to achieve by hiring designers?\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. A transformational design change that would rejuvenate IBM\n\nC. To gain more employees\n\nD. To showcase HP as a corporation",

        "I was driving on Highway 35 on my way home from work. Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on.\nThe city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's.\nI had an idea.\nI made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up.\nNow on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer.\nNo doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.\nQuestion: The driver desires\n===\nThe answer to the above question is",

It\u2019s hard to change that, when the model we have wanted to make work has nonetheless been failing for 40 years.\u201d Professor Brian Boyd\nNo area has remained up there in the contentiousness charts in Scotland as the notion of business and education working together to do something better for our young people.\nMost schools do not \u2018partner\u2019 with colleges or universities. Instead, they are production facilities for undergraduates and college entrants. Fewer are set up to systematically provide apprenticeship opportunities as well as learning. At NoTosh, we\u2019ve been working on a few, nascent projects to change the attitudes of schools from being these production facilities into something more of a life support - what metrics of success might we use if schools judged their success on the results of their alumni, five, ten or twenty years down the line, much like universities do?\nCity of Glasgow College have partnered with Newlands Junior College (NJC) to make the experience of a day in college more than what, in other circumstances, is too often perceived as a day off from school. The Junior College is called this, and not a school, for that very reason, to mark it out as a stepping stone between school and full-blown college.

Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she\u2019s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet.\nNeedless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes.\nUnfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn\u2019t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week.\nNothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc.\nWhen I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different.\nThere was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway.\nMy pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded.\nMy alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through.\nThere were several\u2026uhmmm\u2026 \u201cpresents\u201d in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet.\nI figure that trip cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of $1k to repair the damage.\nSo I did what any 24 year old would do when faced with that situation.\nI cleaned up, went to bed, and went back to London a few weeks later. But I cat proofed the house first. (Yes, they still lived with me for another 12 years before passing away.)\nLike I said, she was wearing very interesting pajamas when I got to London.

The Crew's house by the cemetery was less than half a mile from where they'd last seen Winston. Walking, it might've taken ten minutes to get there, but on Chloe's Vespa it was a hair-raising three-minute ride away. When they got there, Paul saw no sign of either Winston or Lily, so he assumed they were still inside the rundown shack that passed for a gallery. They parked a block away and approached at a brisk walk, Paul almost jogging to keep up with Chloe's excited strides.\nWinston was Chloe's mentor in what they referred to as \"The Life,\" this being a euphemism for a whole range of different activities, groups and lifestyles that fell under the general category of living underground and off the information grid. Paul, after defrauding his former partners and then running afoul of the law in a very public way, had been living The Life for almost a year and a half now. Chloe, as near as he could tell, had been doing it for almost a decade. Winston had started in the late '60s as a 16-year-old member of the notorious Weather Underground. He not only led his own Crew, he was also in contact with dozens, maybe scores of other such groups all over the world, including Chloe and Paul's little Crew of four. On top of all that, he'd once taken a couple bullets while helping Paul out, so, like Chloe, Paul had a soft spot in his heart for the old man.\nThey hadn't seen him since that bloody night, but Chloe had been in communication with him off and on over the last sixteen months. Winston and his Crew were old school and didn't trust much in the way of electronic communications. Mostly it had been encoded, hand-delivered letters and arcane classified ads in various newspapers. Chloe found this particular breed of paranoia on Winston's part annoying, but Paul admired it.\nQuestion: How long has Winston probably been a part of underground groups?\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB.

        "I\u2019ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream. Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I\u2019ve reviewed since has disappointed me!\nToday I\u2019m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra  Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It\u2019s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque\u2019s slightly expensive price tag.\nThe first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too.\nThe mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it\u2019s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.  The mask doesn\u2019t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.\nQuestion: How long did it probably take the reviewer to use the Trufflesque product?\nOptions:\n- 4 hours \n - overnight \n - About a half hour \n - not enough information\n===\nThe correct answer is",

        "WHITE HOUSE \u2014 President Donald Trump, after a tactical retreat this week on immigration policy, demonstrated Friday that there is no strategic shift to his overall tough approach to those attempting to illegally enter the country, and vowing to \"end the immigration crisis, once and for all.\"\nU.S. immigration laws, Trump declared, are \"the weakest in the history of the world.\"\nTrump made the remarks in an auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House, where he presided over an event with so-called \"Angel Families,\" those who have had relatives killed by people who entered the country illegally.\n\"Your loss will not have been in vain,\" the president told the families, who held large photos of their slain relatives. \"We will secure our borders \u2026 the word will get out. Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\"\nTrump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security.\nCrime assertion\nTrump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens.\nHowever, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year.\nFollowing intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \"zero tolerence\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children.\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: What did President Trump think of the compliments from the Angel Families?\nOptions:\n- They made him feel proud of the work he had done on border security.\n- not enough information\n- They were for Mike Pence only and not him.\n- They made him feel afraid of Angel Families.",

The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the \u201ceighth wonder of the world.\u201d\nThe version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there\u2019s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice\u2019s major waterway.\nThe Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge.\nBeginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge\u2019s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge.\nAndrea Palladio\u2019s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte\u2019s.\nQuestion: when was wooden bridge rebuild?\nOptions:\n- 1310\n- 1524\n- 1444\n- not enough information",

I like getting great service, and see so many things about systems-thinking that work well in airlines, that I'm happy to forgive small indiscrepancies when they occur.

        "The political landscape in the United States looks a bit different in the wake of Tuesday's Senate election victory by Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama.\nIn an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound.\nLate Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\" he told supporters.\nMoore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s.\nMoore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\"\nMoore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore.\nThe president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result.\n\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\" he said. \"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\"\nJones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans.

The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice.\nAt a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\" he said.\nOpinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \"You know what it is? You get complacent,\" he said. \"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\"\nThe president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November.\n\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\" Trump told the audience. \"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\"\nAccording to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms.\nHistorically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent.\nQuestion: Who has Trump turned up the heat on?\nOptions:\n\nA. Republicans\n\nB. Democrats\n\nC. not enough information\n\nD. Independents",

A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it\u2019s my first time walking through my local market.\nThere are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany\u2019s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily.

It\u2019s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course).\nIf you\u2019ve never tasted agretti before, it\u2019s worth seeking out if you\u2019re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu.

On my seventh birthday, my parents bought me a second-hand ZX Spectrum and, in a foretaste of my life to come, I immediately set about learning how to use it to get attention. It's a sign of how rapidly technology develops that my crappy Spectrum, with its 48k of memory, already had 12k more storage power than the computer that had guided the Apollo 11 moon landing eighteen years earlier* With power like that, there seemed to be no limit to what I could do.\nWhile my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house.\nFrom that day on, the possibilities offered by technology to both subvert the norm and get attention had me hooked.\nYears later, at secondary school, I convinced my English teacher, Mr Coen, to teach me desktop publishing, ostensibly to work on the official school magazine, but in reality to produce an alternative underground version - complete with less than flattering articles about teachers and fellow pupils and distributed via the publicly accessible shared hard drive that was supposed to be used for collaborative coursework. That particular stunt got me banned from the school computer room for half a term.\nAnd then, in 1997, I discovered the Internet.\nThroughout history, every fame-hungry media dickhead has found his preferred medium for pursuing fame and wealth (in that order).

        "For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives.\nThe goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs.\nOctober 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture.\nIf you\u2019re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...\nAimee probably thinks that\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- The conferences will foster dialogue and collaboration\n- The conferences will get her a new job\n- not enough information\n- The conferences will allow her to sell her software",

He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled.

        "In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time.\nThe payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort.\nDavid Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following:\nDoing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency \u2013 and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality.\nMany studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress \u2013 which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix.\nImagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles.\nThe mind is the same.\nThe more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task.\nThe more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become.\nBut . . .  that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand.\nLet your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the \u201ctop-of-mind\u201d because everything that happens...\nAccording to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.\nQuestion: How long can someone multitask for before becoming stressed out?\nOptions:\n\nA. 30 minutes\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC. 3 days\n\nD. 5 hours",

        "When I was a patrolman working the 11PM to 7AM shift we received a phone call from a police department about 200 miles away in a neighboring state. It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nEarlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife\u2019s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas.\nA request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him.\nI returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man\u2019s transport. The sergeant said he hadn\u2019t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife. I just got back into town about an hour ago, so I changed into my uniform, and I\u2019m here for my shift!\nI learned later that this patrolman had taken it upon himself to contact the man\u2019s wife and the only vehicle they owned was out of gas 200 miles away. So this officer stayed up all day after a working the midnight shift and used his own car for the 400 mile trip. The officer said when he picked the man up at the station; he looked at the officer and smiled. He recognized his neighbor. This frail elderly man surely did not remember this selfless act of kindness. But it made a lasting impression on me, and on what it means to be a good cop.\nWho was the sergeant at the time?\n\nA.

        "The Getty Villa is a museum unlike any in the world. It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context.\nSince 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects\u2019 subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context.\nReenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture.\nStarting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor\u2019s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor\u2019s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean.\nWhat was probably true about the artwork?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n- the pieces were of minor value to humanity\n- not enough information\n- it was shown in chronological order\n- the subject matter was narrow",

He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments \u2014 a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nIndia has grown close with the U.S., especially as China projects its growing military power beyond its shores.\n\nThe U.S.-India relationship, Modi said, \"has resumed new significance in the changing world.\" An important aspect of that partnership is \"a shared vision of an open, stable, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,\" he added.\n\nFor decades, India has embraced a non-aligned status, which means it does not choose sides between world powers. In keeping with that position, Modi warned against a \"return to great power rivalries.\"\n\nThe Indian prime minister also insisted that \"Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other's interests.\"\nIndia is the world's largest democracy. It has the world's seventh-largest economy. Within a decade, it is expected to pass China to become the world's most populous country.\nQuestion: After the end of the story, US and India relations:\nOptions:\n- probably will improve in importance\n- probably will have a great downfall\n- probably will remain the same\n- not enough information",

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment \u2013 even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life.\nWhen you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more.  A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite.\nThere is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence.\nWhen you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life.  A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living.\nIt is not just physical well-being that is neglected \u2013 mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care.\nWhen your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals\nConvenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet.\nQuestion: After leading a frenetic lifestyle, people are properly\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. happy and relaxed\n\nC. energized and fit\n\nD. stressed and malnourished",

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance.\nThe first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head.\nI had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident.\n\"No, absolutely not,\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest.\n\"I was invited!\" I said, exasperated. \"I have documentation.\" I waved the rave card in front of his face.\n\"No dice.\"\nI stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera.\n\"Motherfucker,\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera.\nI didn't know it at the time, but at that moment Dylan Maxwell was sitting in front of a wall of monitors, laughing his ass off.\nWho was sitting infront of surveillance monitors?\nPick the correct answer from the following options:\n\nA. the doorman\n\nB. not enough information\n\nC.

The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen.\nThere was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked).

Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on.

So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare.

He was greeted by Moon, who waited on the South Korean side of the borderline in the village of Panmunjom, the historic site, where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953.

        "Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.\nContext: In the 1970s I was a student nurse in psychiatry. I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet.\nOne of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, \u201cYou think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!\u201d as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse.\nI worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved.\nI was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been.\nIt is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her.\nQuestion: Who was the impatient nurse?\nOptions:\n\nA. not enough information\n\nB. Connie's personal nurse\n\nC. The narrating nurse's ward colleague\n\nD. The narrating nurse's school classmate",
