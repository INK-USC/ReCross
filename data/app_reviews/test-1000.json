As it is  you have to press the escape Android icon twice... once to clear the keyboard and once again to return to the main task entry form. Easy enough but not at all intuitive.

Brilliant swiss knife of a search engine. The inbuilt browser is capable and seamless. Respects privacy. The bangs are epic. Forget all other search engines  including Google. Just one quirk.
