It would make a big difference to repo browsing.

It's way faster than the official Facebook app  it functions more like the Facebook Web  but is better than using your browser on Android for Facebook.

(That should be fixed ASAP) I also would like to see a way to do more advanced configurations like you can with most desk top client. Both those things are big deals with me. For that it is only a 3 star. Removed one star for each problem I had. Do not let that make you think this is not a good thing to use though. I still do. I need to know one thing not tested as of now but when certifying keys can you pick the certification of the key? and add notes to the cert? (Both of those things I would like to see too if it is not there) I do use a key policy URL so I would like to use it on the phone app too if possible.

I've been using this the day I got my new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and it has tremendously helped with my language learning instead of reading it all the time! :3 Though I do like it paired with Read Aloud  another awesome tool I have for selecting text and listening to my selection in my target learning language  I do have a few minor issues. For some odd reason  the Notify and Read Aloud apps do not automatically detect the languages I select in Read Aloud and only goes with a default language I set. This means I have to manually set the language I want read  which is very annoying. In addition  the language detection percentage found in Read Aloud does not work at all in my heavy testing. One other problem I have is the headset I plug in my phone used to read the audio stream I set to read aloud doesn't seem to work anymore. When I first downloaded the app a few days ago  it worked even with the head-set on. Now  it tells me \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Screen On\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" highlighted in red as a reason why it did not speak my chosen stream.

It's nice to have fast access to it. The only thing that could make this better is being able to set the wallpaper to something other then our home screen wallpaper. My lock screen was a modeling photo of my wife. My home screen is Cortana from Halo. My wife's photo is to busy to be a home screen but it would be great if I could use it as a lockscreen"

In ES file explorer I am told that I don't have root when trying to use the built in root explorer  but when I go into the system folder  I can see everything  so I know I have root  but it isn't set up properly. when I use terminal emulator it won't give root at all\"",

I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 4  and like a lot of other people  the app crashes on trying to load a game and returns to the home screen. I did a fresh setup  and it says you're supposed to boot the bios first before loading a game  but even that makes it crash. All the files are correct and stored in the correct folders on the phone's internal memory  not an external SD card  which for some reason isn't accepted. I followed directions to the tee  and the app is just broken. Someone please fix this so I can finally play my games again."

Also the DashClock extension doesn't update automatically as far as I can tell  so it's kind of useless in that sense.

        "Given this review: \"Rainfall map is not upgrading I checked it for the first time 2 days ago. But the map is not updated after that. So  it will be nice to have 3 options. 1) add that there is no updates after this time 2)let store the old maps and let play it to see the movements 3) let us save the maps based on timings choosed by us. Other than that  i love it.\"\nWould you recommend this app to a friend? Not at all, No, Maybe, Yes, or Definitely?",

I grew up in the 1980s playing these Infocom titles  and while I go back to them every so often as an adult  I've yet to get that same feel from mobile Z-machines (such as Son of Hunky Punk  which otherwise is also good). The chat-text interface here is the perfect transition to modern mobile platforms for these games  and I'm frankly amazed that no one had thought of it before. As others have mentioned here  the only real point of frustration I have is the lack of .z4 support  which eliminates later classic Infocom titles such as A Mind Forever Voyaging. But for about 70-80% of Infocoms and virtually anything produced in the Inform era (post-1997 or so)  this Z interpreter is just spot on. I'm giving this five stars  because it deserves it  even without .z4 support. With .z4 support  I'd be petitioning Google to make a six-star rating possible."
