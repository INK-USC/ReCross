Did not know what I got till I played with it. All in one monitor app. Obviously an app can't do everything  but this will point you in the right direction. Found the Samsung browser on my s5 was what was wrong with my data. A preinstalled app. So I switched to chrome. After watching it  chrome stays in region. Samng browser was connecting all over. Dublin  Georgia Maine Washington. This app showed me the light if it. Thank you for this app showing me what was really going on with MY damn data. Android sucks. But this makes it better running stock roms. Back to say I am still impressed. I know exactly what my data is doing by IP address. Like I said still finding messed up apps. Disabled stock ones. I don't want to root again.. so with this I can find the apps running and connecting and disable them threw my app manager. This is strictly a window into what your phone is doing. Also quick look ups on IP addresses used by your connections. Update 4/23/17 I can't say enough about this app. Was about to root my phone to get rid of all the junk apps. Well didn't need to because of this app right here showing me what was connecting in the background and what was running my phone dead everyday. It doesn't tell you this. You have to use the app. Look at your connection and running apps. I had apps running I never used. Restricted the background data and Bam. Phone flies again. Between this and old ass s5  makes these new phones look slow. Thank you again guys & gals.\"",
