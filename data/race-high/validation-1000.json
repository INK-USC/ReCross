        "Question: I have a one-year-old female bulldog, who has recently taken to biting my shoes when we are in the park and I'm on the mobile. She can be slightly aggressive and I'm starting to get worried and a bit annoyed. How do I stop her? ----Susan, London.\nAnswer: You need to get this problem under control before it could escalate  . I always advise owners not to talk on the mobile phone when they go for a walk with their dogs, because they should be focusing on this time with their pets, but I know people have busy lives and need to make phone calls.\nThe behavior she is showing is either controlling or playfulness, but they both result from the same issue ---- you are not paying attention to her. If you must make phone calls while on a walk, try to still engage with your dog by speaking towards her, playing some sorts of game and so on. If that doesn't work, you'll have to try more of a training approach.\nYou will need a training line and some treats. Start your walk in the usual way, make a phone call, and when your dog starts displaying the undesired behavior, simply stop walking --- otherwise she will see it as a game. When she is calm and looking at you, or if she sits, give her a treat; then continue walking. If she starts up again, pick up the lead, gently pull it, and tell her \"no\".  Then ask her to sit and give her a treat if she does.\nThe aim of this is to try to get her to forget how much fun it is biting your shoes. Do little sessions every day --- and try not to answer the phone if you know it's going to be a long conversation. Be patient and good luck!\nRemember that if an animal shows signs of distress or discomfort, an early visit to the vet is always recommended.\nHow can Susan get her pet dog to forget the fun from biting her shoes?\nA) By playing some sort of game with the pet dog.\nB) By punishing the pet dog strictly.\nC) By training her not to do so.\nD) By leaving her at home.",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article:\nArticle: If you haven't already, you too should switch to the latest eco-friendly, energy-efficient, energy-saving LED (Light Emitting Diode) lighting. As the world becomes more focused on green issues, everyone should do their part in practicing energy efficiency, recycling, cutting down their CO2emissions and much, much more. One of the most successful campaigns that started in Australia is the now world-famous\"Earth Hour\". 2.2 million of Sydney's residents turned off their lights for an hour in a mass attempt to save energy. The following year, the same idea was adopted by a whole host of different cities.\nThis is a great example of a campaign to promote eco-friendly options and energy efficiency. But while it clearly raises awareness, it is not a long-term solution to energy saving across the developed world. A long-term solution can be found in the form of switching to LED lighting rather than the traditional halogen lights  found in a typical home.\nPut simply, LED lighting is the future of lighting. LED lamps use up only a fraction of the energy compared to that of regular lamps. They also produce a quality flicker-free light, and will last longer than a regular light with 50,000 hours being realistic. Not only are they longer lasting and more energy-efficient with no sacrifice in light quality, but they may quickly become a possible substitute   for regular lamps that have been previously installed by homes and businesses.\nAn ordinary 50 watt low-voltage halogen light on for 4 hours a day would cost $ 25 per year to run. With a life span of around 3,000 hours it will typically stop working at the two-year mark. Compared with the regular one, an LED light of 50 watts operating for the same period will cost roughly $ 6 per year to run and last 50,000 hours. That means it won't have to be replaced for 24 years! It really is a _ to switch to energy-saving LED lighting. Plus, you will be doing your bit for the environment by becoming more eco-friendly.",

Researchers found that walking around with a forced smile and faking happiness simply led to people feeling gloomier. So, putting a brave face on your woes could actually be counterproductive.\n   The research found that women suffered more than men when pretending to be happy. Psychologist, Dr. Brent Scott, who led the study, said employers should take note because forcing workers to smile when workers were dealing with clients could backfire  . He said:\"Smiling for the sake of smiling can lead to emotional exhaustion, and that's bad for the organization.\"\n   Dr. Scott said the research showed customer service workers who\"faked smiles\"throughout a day worsened their moods and then withdrew from work, so their productivity dropped. He added:\"Bosses may think that getting their staff to smile is good for the organization, but that's not necessarily the case.\"Dr. Scott, assistant professor of management at Michigan State University, analyzed a group of bus drivers during a two -week period.\n   The study is one of the first of its kind to examine emotional displays over a period of time and compare the different effects that they have on men and women. His team examined the effects of\"surface acting\"--or fake smiling--compared to what was termed\"deep acting\", or cultivating positive emotions by recalling pleasant memories.\nDr. Scott said: \"Women were harmed more by'surface acting', meaning their moods worsened even more than men and they withdrew more from work. However , they were helped more by'deep acting',which meant their moods improved more.\"\nDr. Scott suggested women tended to suffer more when pretending to be happy because they were expected to be more emotionally expressive than men. Therefore, faking a smile while they are feeling down is more likely to go against their normal behavior and cause more harmful feelings.\nAlthough,\"deep acting\"seemed to improve moods in the short term, Dr....\nOptions:\nA they forget their trouble\nB they will behave normally\nC they become more talkative\nD their moods are getting better\nAnswer:\nD their moods are getting better\nQuestion:",

We have so easily been attracted by the promise of diet products that we have stopped thinking about what diet products are doing to us. We are paying for products that harm us psychologically and physically.\nIt's obvious that diet products weaken us psychologically. They allow us to jump over the thinking stage that our weight problems lie not in actually losing the weight, but in controlling the consumption of fat. All we have to do is to swallow or recognize the word \"diet\" in food labels.\nWhat's more, diet products have greater psychological effects. Every time we have a zero-calorie drink, we are telling ourselves that we don't have to work to get results.Diet products make people believe that gain comes without pain, and that life can be without resistance and struggle.\nAs a matter of fact, the danger that diet products bring not only lies in the psychological effects they have on us, but also in the physical harm they cause. Diet foods and diet pills contain zero calorie. oaly because the diet industry has created chemicals to produce these wonder products, And they can indirectly harm our bodies because consuming them instead of healthy foods means we are stopping our bodies having basic nutrients. Diet products may not be nutritional, and the chemicals that go into diet products are potentially dangerous.\nLosing weight lies in the power of minds, not in the power of chemicals.

The whip gets all of the attention, but it's mostly for show. In reality, it's the chair that does the important work. When a lion tamer holds a chair in front of the lion's face, the lion tries to focus on all four legs of the chair at the same time. With its focus divided, the lion becomes confused and is unsure about what to do next. When faced with so many options, the lion chooses to freeze and wait instead of attacking the man holding the chair.\nHow often do you find yourself in the same position as the lion? How often do you have something you want to achieve (e.g. lose weight, start a business, travel more)--only to end up confused by all of the options in front of you and never make progress?\nThis upsets me to no end because while all the experts are busy debating about which option is best, the people who want to improve their lives are left confused by all of the conflicting information. The end result is that we feel like we can't focus or that we're focused on the wrong things, and so we take less action, make less progress, and stay the same when we could be improving.\nIt doesn't have to be that way. Anytime you find the world waving a chair in your face, remember this: All you need to do is focus on one thing. You just need to get started. Starting before you feel ready is one of the habits of successful people. If you have somewhere you want to go, something you want to accomplish, someone you want to become...take immediate action.

To play the violin well takes 10,000 hours of practice. How can we expect people to learn to be happy without large amounts of practice and repetition?\"\nIt is believed that at least two percent of British children under 12 now struggle with significant depression.

A UNICEF study involving 21 developed countries showed that British children were the least satisfied with their lives, while the World Health Organization predicts that childhood psychiatric   disorders will rise by 50 percent by 2020.\nIn a speech at Cambridge University, Lord Layard said the Government's lessons in manners did not go far enough. \"We need a commitment to producing a major specialism in this area, with a serious teacher training program,\" he said.\nHowever, happiness lessons have been criticized by academics. Frank Furedi, a sociology professor at Kent University and author of Therapy Culture, said: \"In pushing emotional literacy, what some teachers are really doing is abandoning teaching.

Past studies have shown that early humans were able to cross the open ocean as far back as 50,000 years ago, but evidence that they could fish while in the open sea dated back only to 12,000 years ago.\n              \"In most areas of the world, evidence for our early ancestors' coastal exploitation   was drowned by rising sea level,\" said researcher Sue O'Connor.\n              Now O'Connor and her colleagues have found evidence of prehistoric fishing tools and the remains of large fish such as tuna    at a cave shelter known as Jerimalai, located in the Southeast Asian island nation of East Timor. Their discovery uncovered fishing hooks made from bone that dated back to about 42,000 years ago.\n              \"It's possible that people caught the tuna in the deep channel that lies off the coast of the Jerimalai shelter,\" O'Connor said.\n              The site, first uncovered in 2005, also included bone points, shell beads, the remains of fish, turtles, bats and birds, and nearly 10,000 stone tools. The island of Timor has very few land animals overall and only small birds call the island home, perhaps explaining why the ancient people here went fishing. About half the fish remains at the site came from fish such as tuna. Catching such fast-moving fish requires much planning and complex technology, suggesting that early humans developed these skills earlier than previously thought.\n              Some other scientists might say that most of the fish bones seen are from young fish, and thus might have been caught more easily off the coast as opposed to in open waters.

        "Article: It's not so surprising that US First Lady Michelle Obama has called Modern Family her favorite TV series. September saw the fun, heartwarming sitcom take home the Best Comedy Series award at the 2013 Emmys. This is the fourth year in a row that the series has won that title. The show features three families who move in and out of each other's lives. The first one is a typical American family: the working dad Phil, stay-at-home mom Claire and their three children.\nThe second family is made up of Jay, his young Hispanic wife and her son Manny. Jay, 65, is the father of Claire. He is 30 years older than his wife and everyone mistakes the two for being father and daughter.\nThe third family is made up of a gay couple, Mitchell and Cameron, and their adopted daughter Lily. Mitchell is Jay's son.\nOn Sept 25, the show started its fifth season, in which Claire makes a big change - she returns to work. The other big storylines include Jay's stepson Manny starting high school and Mitchell and Cameron looking for a primary school for Lily. Will things go right for the three families?\nModern Family has no spies, aliens or vampires  ; it's just about ordinary people. So what has made it such a hit?\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, its \"presentation of contemporary US society\" contributes to its success. The show presents what a typical \"nuclear family\" is like in the US: two parents, a big house and two or three children. When there's a fight between their kids, Phil wants to be the \"cool dad\" while traditional mom Claire lives by the saying \"an eye for an eye\". She always forces Phil to punish the troublemaker.\nThe show also touches upon developments in interracial relations in the US by focusing on Hispanic communities. This makes sense, as \"by 2040, America will no longer be a majority-white country, with the fastest growth rate among Hispanics...\" BBC pointed out.\nIn addition, according to BBC, 40 percent of Americans say they have a gay friend or relative. By including Mitchell and Cameron, Modern Family reflects...\nQuestion: What's new in Modern Family's fifth season?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Claire goes back to work.\"?",

That means longer days instead of the traditional Monday through Friday schedule.\nHaving been approved for three years and beginning in the fall, students in the Maccray school district in Minnesota will be in school from Tuesday to Friday. Each school day will be 65 minutes longer. Officials say the district expects to save about sixty-five thousand dollars a year in transportation costs.\nIn new Mexico, the first school district changed to a four-day week in 1974 because of the Arab oil boycott . Now, 17 out of 89 districts use it.\nIn Custer, South Dakota, students have been going to school four days a week since 1995. Superintendent Tim Creal says the change has saved about one million dollars over just the past eight years. He sees other benefits, too. Students get more instructional time, and activities that used to take up class time are now held on non-school days. He says that in the future, the growth of online classes could make it possible to require even fewer days in school. High fuel prices are driving college students to take more online classes.\nA four-day school week sounds like a great idea for students and teachers, but working parents may have to pay for child care for that fifth day.\nQuestion: The passage is mainly about  _\n- some school's four-day week plan\n- districts using a four-day week.\n- how to save on transportation fees.\n- expense of school transportation.",

His talent in singing did not come up as a surprise, as he had a good voice right from his childhood. When Elvis was ten years old, he participated in a Talent Contest at Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show and won a prize for the song he sang. \nWhen Elvis was 13 years old, his family moved to Tennessee. To support himself and his father, Elvis took on a job as a truck driver. A disc containing two ballads   that Elvis had recorded for his mother as a birthday gift was first heard by Sun Studio's president Sam Phillips. After listening to Elvis, Sam made Elvis an offer and that was the birth of a new singing sensation ; a new superstar was born. In 1954 his first record was released from Sun Studio.\nIn 1955, Elvis singed a $35,000 recording contract with RCA Victor (through Thomas Parker), who promised to help in projecting Elvis Presley (a Local Star) as a National Level Star. As promised, Elvis was shown in newspapers, television appearances, photographs where he was claimed to be the next superstar of the music world.\nIn 1956, his first performance with \"Heartbreak Hotel\" on The Milton Berle Show successfully put Elvis on the top list of the superstars and the nationwide \"Elvis Craze\" was started. Elvis became the prince who ruled hearts of his millions of fans.\nIn 1960, he quit performing in concerts and concentrated in making movies. As his first movie Love Me Tender was a big hit, he had no problem in marking his comeback in movies.\nAfter making several very successful and hit movies, Elvis returned to the world of music. In 1968, Elvis once again started working with his old band and gave some more smashing   hits to the world. In 1972, he released his last top-ten single Burning Love. \nIt's nearly impossible to measure the level of popularity he had reached in his career. Elvis Presley had more than 100 records on the billboard charts and out of which, about 18 records were on number one position on the charts....\nQuestion: Which of the following is TRUE?\nAnswer:",

An international team found a gene that made some of the trees produce more oil than others.\nDr Rajinder Singh, from government agency the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, said, \"The oil palm has three fruit forms: a thick-shelled type --the Dura; those that don't have any shell--the Pisifera; a third form produced as a cross between the thick shell and the one without the shell--the Tenera, which are more of the fleshy fruit to produce the oil,\" and the researchers identified the gene producing this trait.\nWhile oil palm growers attempt to grow only the thin-shelled Tenera variety, up to 10% of the seeds can be contaminated  , and turn out to be the other less oily plants. Prof. Martienssen, from the Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory, said, \"We can now use that gene in genetic testing, which will allow growers as well as producers to know exactly what sort of tree they are planting before it produces fruit. It takes a long time for these trees to produce fruit, but by being able to predict exactly what sort of fruit that trees will produce, it will greatly assist growers.\"\nThe researchers say this could offer a more sustainable form of agriculture. Prof. Martienssen said, \"This finding gives us huge hope. We hope to maximize land usage and produce a lot more on the same amount of land, because we do not want to destroy the rainforest any more.\"\nHowever, the environmental group WWF-UK said that the global demand for oil palm was growing rapidly, making the expansion of plantations inevitable.\nAdam Harrison, the organization's food and agriculture policy officer, said, \"In a sense it does not matter if a 'good' variety replaces forest or a 'bad' one, the wildlife and communities that need access to that land will suffer. So for palm oil to be sustainable, the process of allocating   land needs to be controlled. There is an abundance of low-carbon, low-wildlife and conflict-free land available and there is no more need for forest...\nQuestion: What difficulty are the oil palm growers faced with?\nOptions: A: The more oily palms easily died of bad weather.\nB: The more oily palms can change to the less oily ones.\nC: They don't have enough land to grow oil palms.\nD: They are unable to predict exactly what sort of fruit the trees they are planting will produce.",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\nArticle: Why are so many people so afraid of failure? Quite simply because no one tells us how to fail so that failure becomes an experience that will lead to growth. We forget that failure is part of the human condition and that every person has the right to fail.\n        Most parents work hard at either preventing failure or protecting  their children  from the knowledge that they have failed. One way is to lower standards. A mother describes her child's hurriedly-made table as \"perfect\"! Even though it couldn't stand on uneven (not same in height) legs. Another way is to shift   blame. If John fails in science, his teacher is unfair or stupid.\n       The trouble with failure-prevention methods is that they leave a child unequipped for life in the real world. The young need to learn that no one can be best at everything, that no one can win all the time and that it's possible to enjoy a game even when you don't win. A child who's not invited to a birthday party, who doesn't make the honor roll or the baseball team feel terrible, of course. But parents should not offer a quick comfort prize or say \"It doesn't matter\" because it does. The young should be allowed to experience disappointment and be helped to master it.\n       Failure is never pleasurable. It hurts grown-ups and children exactly alike. But it can make a positive contribution to your life once you learn to use it. Step one is to ask  \"Why did I fail?\" Control the natural impulse   to blame someone else. Ask yourself what you did wrong, and how you can improve. If someone else can help, don't be shy about asking them.\nOptions:\nA blame someone else.\nB face it yourself and not ask others to help.\nC forget it as soon as possible.\nD think it over and find way to improve it.\nAnswer:\nD think it over and find way to improve it.\nQuestion:",

        "Article: Good Genes Mean Long Life\nScientists have discovered that living to the age of 100 may have nothing to do with the lifestyle you lead and everything to do with the type of genes you have.\nFor the lucky carriers of \"Methuselah\" genes, worries over smoking, eating unhealthily and not getting enough exercise may not be as necessary as to those of us without the special gene pattern  .\nThe \"Methuselah\" genes could give extra protection against the diseases of old age such as cancer and heart disease. They could also protect people against the effects of the unhealthy lifestyles that we believe will lead us to an early death, scientists say. However, the genes are very rare.\nThe genes include ADIPOQ, which is found in about 10 percent of young people but in nearly 30 percent of people living past 100. They also include the CETP and the ApoC3 genes, which are found in 10 percent of young people, but in about 20 percent of people over 100 years old.\nSome of those genes were discovered by a research group at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, led by Professor Nir Barzilai. The team studied the genes of over 500 people over 100 years old, and their children.\nThe studies show that tiny mutations   in the make-up of some genes can greatly increase a person's lifespan  . Barzilai told a Royal Society conference that the discovery of such genes gave scientists clear targets for developing drugs that could prevent age-related diseases, allow people to live longer and stay healthy.\nDavid Gems, a researcher at University College London, believes that drugs to slow ageing will become widespread.\n\"If we know which genes control longevity   then we can ... target them with drugs. That makes it possible to slow down ageing,\" he told The Times.\n\"Much of the pain and suffering in the world are caused by ageing. If we can find a way to reduce that, then we are obliged   to take it.\"\nQuestion: According to the article, which of the following is the most important if a person is to live to the age of 100?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Having the right types of genes.\"?",

        "Article: You may have seen a talking parrot on a TV show, in a movie, or even in someone's home. The parrot has learned to copy sounds that people make. Birds are not the only animals that can copy the noises they hear. Dolphins, bats, and some apes also copy sounds. Now we can add elephants to this list of copycats.\nDr. Joyce Poole is a zoologist. She studies the sounds of elephants. While she was in Kenya, she would hear strange noises made by Mlaika after sunset. Mlaika was a 10-year-old African elephant.\nMlaika lived near a highway. Dr. Poole says, \"I could not tell the difference between Mlaika's call and the distant truck noise.\" She and other scientists studied Mlaika's sounds. It turned out that Mlaika was copying the sounds of the trucks driving by. Why would Mlaika copy trucks that she heard going by on the highway? Animals that are able to copy sounds may enjoy practicing new sounds. When they are kept outside of their natural environment, they may copy unusual sounds. That may be why an elephant would copy the sound of a truck.\n\"Mlaika was not the only copycat elephant,\" Dr. Poole says. Calimero is a 23-year-old male African elephant. He spent 18 years with two female Asian elephants. Asian elephants make chirping sounds (sounds made by birds) to talk with one another. African elephants usually do not make chirping sounds. But Calimero now does. He is copying his Asian elephant friends. Dr. Poole says that elephants need to form bonds with their family and friends. She says, \"They make sounds to communicate with each other. When they are separated, they use sounds to keep in contact.\"\nParrots, dolphins, humans, and elephants show that being a copycat is one way that animals and people make new friends and keep old ones.\nQuestion: Why is Calimero mentioned in the passage?\nYes or no, is the answer \"To add another example of copycat elephants.\"?",

Most of their feathers are thrown away.\nBut instead of being buried in land, some feathers could find a future in plastics .\nOne of the products they have developed is a flowerpot . It may look like other flowerpots. But the container breaks down in the earth within one to five years. And as it _ , it naturally becomes nutrient  in the soil.\nThe environmentally friendly flowerpot is the work of two researchers. Walter Schmidt is with the Agricultural Research Service, part of the United States Agriculture Department. Masud Huda is with the Horticultural Research Institute, a private  organization .\nWalter Schmidt has been working to find uses for chicken feathers since the 1990s. Progress in 2002 showed that plastic made from feathers could be formed like other plastics.\nHe says feathers are much stronger and last  longer than another plant material. \"Feathers are stronger. By design, feathers are also more durable .

If you tell your dim friend that he has the potential of an Einstein, _ In one 1990s experiment, a team including psychologist Joel Cooper of Princeton asked participants to write essays opposing funding for the disabled. When the essayists were later praised for their sympathy, they felt even worse about what they had written.\nIn this experiment, Wood, Lee and Perunovic measured 68 students' self-esteem. The participants were then asked to write down their thoughts and feelings for four minutes. Every 15 seconds, one group of students heard a bell. When it rang, they were supposed to tell themselves, \"I am lovable.\"\nThose with low self-esteem didn't feel better after the forced self-affirmation. In fact, their moods turned significantly darker than those of members of the control group, who weren't urged to think positive thoughts.\nThe paper provides support for newer forms of psychotherapy   that urge people to accept their negative thoughts and feelings rather than fight them. In the fighting, we not only often fail but can make things worse. Meditation   techniques, in contrast, can teach people to put their shortcomings into a larger, more realistic perspective. Call it the power of negative thinking.\nQuestion: It can be inferred from the experiment of Wood, Lee and Perunovic that  _  .\nOptions: A: it is important for people to continually keep their self - esteem\nB: self - affirmation can bring a positive change to one's mood\nC: forcing a person to think positive thoughts may lower their self - esteem\nD: people with low self - esteem seldom write down their true feelings",

Unfortunately, that message has not gotten through to the average American, who would rather try switching to \"light\" beer and low-calorie bread than increase physical efforts. The Centers for Disease Control, for example, found that fewer than one-fourth of overweight adults who were trying to lose weight said they were combining exercise with their diet.\nIn rejecting exercise, some people may be discouraged too much by caloric-expenditure charts; for example, one would have to quickly walk hard three miles just to work off the 275 calories in one delicious Danish pastry . Even exercise professionals accept half a point here. \"Exercise by itself is a very tough way to lose weight,\" says York Onnen, program director of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.\nStill, exercise's supporting role in weight reduction is vital. A study at the Boston University Medical Center of overweight police officers and other public employees confirmed that those who dieted without exercise regained almost all their old weight, while those who worked exercise into their daily routine maintained their new weight.\nIf you have been sedentary   and decide to start walking one mile a day, the added exercise could burn an extra 100 calories daily. In a year's time, assuming no increase in food intake, you could lose ten pounds. By increasing the distance of your walks gradually and making other dietary adjustments, you may lose even more weight.",

It's also in the heart of sunny California, a great place to start a family and raise kids. What could be better?\nBut something is happening to their children. Up until the age of two they develop normally. But then everything seems to go backwards. The children become locked into their own small world, unable to communicate at all.\nThey call it the \"curse of Silicon Valley,\" but the medical name for the condition is autism . It used to be thought that autism was a kind of mental illness. Now doctors are sure that it is a neurological disease transmitted genetically. It seems that the people leading the communications revolution are having children who cannot communicate at all.\nBut even the parents have trouble communicating. Asperger's Syndrome is a mild version of autism. People who have it are highly intelligent and often brilliant with numbers or system but have no social skill. This very combination of symptoms makes Asperger's sufferers into ideal computer professionals.\nThe Asperger's sufferer has always been a well--known figure in popular culture. He or she was the eccentric but dedicated scholar or the strange uncle or auntie who never married. But the high numbers of such people in Silicon Valley mean that they can meet others who understand them and share their interests. And while they might not be personally attractive, they can earn truly attractive amounts of money. They can get married and have kids. Unfortunately, many of the children of two Asperger's parents seem to be developing serious autism.\nThere is little anyone can do. It takes hours of work just to make autistic child realize that anyone else exists. And there is no cure in sight. Some argue that no cure should be found. \"It may be that autistics are essentially different from normal people, but that these differences make them invaluable for the evolution of the human race,\" says Dr. Kirk Whilhelmsen of the University of California. \"To eliminate the genes...\nQuestion: Why do people call autism \"curse of Silicon Valley\"?\nOptions: A: Because autistic people live in Silicon Valley.\nB: Because many people working in Silicon Valley have autism children.\nC: Because people with autism will be driven out of Silicon Valley.\nD: Because people with autism are not personally attractive and not liked by others.",

The site's founder, Mark Zuckergerg, states that Face book will continue to work as hard as it has worked in the last six years in order to stay the web's number one communication site.\nThe company started in a dorm room in 2004. Today it has 150 million active users, more than the 130 million of its competitor MySpace.\nFace book set itself apart from other social networking sites because you can communicate with people you really know and trust. Before, most people didn't want to share their real identities online. Face book has given people a safe and trusted environment for people to interact online. It has changed the way people view the world. A friend from any country is only a few clicks away.\nIt was back in February 2004 when Zuckerberg started \"the Face book\" from a Harvard student's room. The aim was to help students get in touch with each other over the Internet. Within 24 hours over a thousand students had signed up and soon after that the network spread out to other universities.\nBy 2005 a research study showed that about 85% of the students in the network had a Face book account. Another survey showed that Face book was almost as important as an iPod. At the end of 2005 Face book came to the UK. And up to today the site has been translated into 35 languages.\nSix years after its start, Face book has escaped the universities and colleges. More than half of its users are not at college any more and the fastest growing group are the 30 to 40-year-olds. Every day 15 million users update their profiles to tell their friends and the world what's happening to them. They also share photos, upload videos, chat, make friends, join groups and simply have fun.\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT true about Face book?\nOptions: A: It's the world's biggest social networking site.\nB: The site of Face book has been translated into 35 languages.\nC: The number of its active users is 20 million more than My Space today.\nD: Face book is considered more important than iPod to the students of the UK.",

Whether you're concerned about cleaning up the environment or you simply want to reduce your electricity bill,residential wind power generators could be a solution.\nProducing wind power at home will not work for everyone. If you live in a over-populated residential area,there may be certain laws and zoning requirements that prohibit the use of windmills .If you live on 1 acre of land or more,you probably won't have any issues but you should investigate carefully to make sure that wind power generators are both legal and practical where you live. Even if there are no laws or regulations prohibiting wind power generators you still need to be in a location that gets enough wind on a regular basis.\nSome producers of wind generators recommend that you live in an area with wind speeds that average at least 10 mph. Newer models have been developed recently that can operate with wind speeds as low as 4 mph but maximum efficiency is achieved at higher wind speeds. Before you fix a wind powered system,you will have to determine your power requirements. Will you be using it to charge a small battery for a boat or vehicle or will you need enough power to run your entire household and be completely off the grid ?Once you know what your power requirements are,you can start shopping around for a system that can meet those needs.\nWind power generators are a great solution for a lot of people.They're an ideal solution for remote locations where it would be impractical or simply too expensive to tap into the grid.They are quiet and totally clean,producing no pollution. They require no fuel and very little maintenance. Residential wind power offers a lot of benefits but it's not for everyone. You'll have to have some money up front to pay for the system and equipment;however,you could save quite a bit of money if...\nWhat attitude might the writer hold towards residential wind power generators?\nA) Negative\nB) Supportive\nC) Skeptical\nD) Cautious",

It's different for every couple. \"Having a conversation about time can be difficult,but it's important for both partners to process those feelings out loud,\" Dr. Treat says. \"You should not be accusing and act as a judge--ask the difficult questions, but do it in a loving way.

        "April sales figures show a disappointing month for Wal-Mart. The world's largest retailer reported a big drop in sales last month--its worst decline in nearly 30 years. As VOA's Mil Arcega reports, Wal-Mart is not alone.\nA three and a half percent drop in sales does not seem like much. But for a company that sells more than $300 billion worth of goods every year, analysts say it is significant. \nAlan Murray, the managing editor of the Wall Street Journal, says the drop represents Wal-Mart's biggest decline since 1979. \"There are a number of things going on. Part of it is early Easter, so some of those sales got moved into March. Part of it is bad weather.\"\nBut it may also signal a trend.  Across the board, retailers from Target to JC Penny and the Gap, reported weaker sales in April.  Analysts say the decline suggests high gasoline prices and the slowing prefix = st1 /U.S.housing market are finally catching up with consumers.Murraysays there may be other factors at play.\n\"Wal-Mart is not doing what it used to do very well. It made an attempt last year to sell clothes to high scale retailers. That didn't work. It had to back off.  It's remodeling  its stores.  That's not working very well,\" says Murray.\nTo bring customers back, some say Wal-Mart needs to go back to its marketing basics.

        "Article: I got interested in the idea of standing desks about a year ago. The health advantages of standing instead of sitting for eight hours a day are clear, so when the company Ergotron invited me to review their WorkFit C-Mod Dual Desk, I jumped out of my chair---really.\nAfter several hours putting the desk together, I finally got to try it out. The standing desk had a desktop that I could use for writing.\nAt first I absolutely loved it. Standing during the day instead of sitting was fantastic. Although I felt more tired after all that standing during the day, I knew the health benefits were worth the slight discomfort. However, after the initial novelty  of the desk wore off, I realized that I could not use it in the long term.\nIt was just not practical. While using the desk for a month , I could definitely foresee problems arising from using it full time.\nI enjoy having a lot of things on my desk. The standing desk just did not have enough room for all of my things.\nI can easily foresee awkward situations when I put that desk in an office space. When someone comes into your office, does your guest have to stand as well? If you office is big enough, maybe you have room for two chairs for you and a visitor, which is great. Yet for the ordinary worker in a small office, the standing desk creates a very awkward situation.\nAdditionally, the amount of money I would have to spend to replace my current workspace with a standing desk was another issue. The desks I have looked at were highly expensive.\nYes, spending the day standing can offset  many of the negative effects of too much sitting, but we humans are designed for movement. Through activity changes like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, you can easily increase the time you spend on your feet. Best of all, those options are completely free.\nQuestion: When the author was asked to try the standing desk out, he was   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"excited\"?",

        "Tom Becker has won the 2007 Waterstone's children's book prize with his first novel, Darkside, receiving a cheque for PS1,000 and the promise of display in branches of the book store across the country.\nThe 25-year-old author described winning as an \"unbelievable feeling\". \"I didn't think my book would be on the shortlist and stood a chance of winning, and it's amazing to receive such an important award at the beginning of my writing career. Needless to say I am absolutely made up.\" he said.\nThe novel, inspired by film noir , fantasy and a fascination with the dark side of the 19th century, is for children between the ages of nine and 12. It tells the story of a boy, Jonathan Stirling, who discovers a similar world filled with vampires and werewolves . This alternative reality has a clearly Victorian air, and is ruled by a descendant of Jack the Ripper. Soon hunters from the other side begin searching for Jonathan, who finds himself driven into their world.\nWaterstone's head children's buyer, Wayne Winstone, thought highly of Becker's \"huge\" achievement. He said: \"Tom Becker's writing style attracts you in the same way that Darren Shan's does with his mix of adventure and the supernatural.\n\"I have a feeling that Tom has real potential and could be one of the big names in children's writing in the future.\"\nThis year's shortlist also included Michael Broad's Jake Cake, Philip Caveney's Sebastian Darke and Siobhan Dowd's A Swift Pure Cry. Last year's prize was won by Julia Golding with The Diamond of Drury Lane.\nThe best title for the passage is probably  _  .\nA) Tom Becker-- a great writer for children\nB) First-time author wins children's fiction prize\nC) An imaginary big prize\nD) Tom Becker's writing style",

I had little money and had only been able to afford to stay with my Aunt Rosa in Spain. So, I wasn't really excited as I knew exactly what it was going to be like: lots of noisy cousins , and Aunt Rosa begging me to take her for a ride.\nAfter I had checked in, I made my way slowly to the departure gate. As I was waiting to board the plane, I kept thinking about my ideal holiday destination: Jamaica, with its long, sandy beaches and crystal clear water.\nAs soon as the plane took off, I fell fast asleep and only woke to the sound of the announcement: \"Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten you seat belts, as we will shortly be landing in Kingston.\" I froze in my seat. Was I dreaming? Kingston? Jamaica? I had boarded the wrong plane!\nImmediately after the plane landed, I explained the situation to the authorities. It seems there were also three other passengers heading for Spain. Apparently it had been the airline's fault, since the flight numbers for Spain and Jamaica were exactly the same! Therefore, with no flight back to London for a week, the airline had no choice but to pay for our stay.\nSo there I was, lying on the beach, enjoying the music and the marvelous food of Jamaica! As for Aunt Rosa, I suppose she just had to live without me!\nQuestion: Which of the following might be the best title of the passage?\nAnswer:",

A week later, the same room costPS 118.15\nIf you can be flexible and want to know dates to avoid--or you're looking for a big event to pass your time--check out sites such as Whatsonwhen.com, which allow you to search for events in the UK by city, date and category.\nSTAYAWAY FROM THE STATIONIf traveling to your destination by train, you may want to find a good base close to the station, but you could end up paying more for the sake of convenience at the start of your holiday.\nDon't be too choosy about the part of town you stay in.

From the beginning she made sure to let me know that I was safe and welcome. \nI remember when I first saw her at the airport. It was different but not uncomfortable. After I was picked up from the airport we went home and she unpacked my luggage. Then she took me shopping for new clothes since the ones I had brought with me from Africa were a bit worn.\nThat night before I went to bed she came to my room, which was the first room I had ever had for my own, with the first bed I didn't have to share. She told me she was glad to have me and that she would take good care of me.\nBefore she walked out of my new room, she asked me for a hug. I had no idea what she was talking about. I did not know what the word hug meant, not because I didn't speak English, but I had just never heard the word before, let alone knew what it meant. So, I just looked at her with a questioning expression on my face.\nBut she didn't give up. She called my father into the room and asked him to explain to me what she meant. When my father was explaining I looked at her and wondered why she wanted to hug me. She then told me it was because she loved me and opened her arms wide. Shyly I opened mine and we hugged.\nThat was my very first hug and I was 11 at that time. I'm 23 now and, thankfully, I have received many hugs since then.\nI consider her my birth mother because life began when I came to stay with her. For the first time there were no kids for me to take care of and I became a child for the first time. There was no work waiting for me every day other than the occasional chores that she gave me to teach me responsibility. \nToday I say thank-you to my mother; thank you for giving me my childhood back after it had been taken away from me.

        "A\nMost of us feel upset if we miss just one meal, and if we try to go without food for 12 hours we would really be uncomfortable. But there are some people who seem able to \"fast\" for very long periods.\nVarious records are claimed for long fast, but in most cases there is no medical proof and so the records are doubtful. One South African woman claimed that she lived for 102 days on nothinig but water and soda water.\nThere are great differences among living things in the ability to survive without food. For example , a tick , which lives on animals, may survive a whole year. Warm-blooded animals use up their stores of food in the body more quickly.\nIn fact, the smaller and more active the animal, the more quickly it uses up its reserves. A small bird starves to death in about five days, a dog in about twenty. In general, we can say that a warm-blooded creature will die when it has lost about half its normal weight.\nThis matter of weight is important. Man and other creatures live in a state of metabolic equiplibrium which means maintaining the body weight once a certain point has been reached. This regulation of body weight is done by thirst, hunger, and appetite.\nWhen your blood lacks nutritional materials, this registers in the hunger center of the brain and you feel \"hungry\". The body is crying out for any kind of fuel(food). And it is our appetite that sees to it hat we chooose a mixed diet, which is the kind the body needs.\nAccording to this passage, a man will die    _   .\nA) when a certain point in losing weight has been reached.\nB) when his blood lacks nutritional material\nC) when his normal weight is lost\nD) when he goes without food for more than 12 hours",

This is the first worldwide agreement on a public health issue. It will see strong warnings added to cigarette packets and a ban on all tobacco advertising.\nYoung smokers may think little of the health effects of smoking. But smoking can stop them from making friends, as most non-smokers don't like being around smokers.\n\"I feel sick when I see people of my age smoke. Smokers make themselves look less educated ,\" said Shi Qingyu, a Senior 3 student at Luanxian No 1 High School in Hebei Province.

Indeed, he still performs fairly regularly -- a week ago he flew to Chicago to play two nights at a local club.\n  And though he has a homeless appearance, Mr. Corey lives in a comfortable 1840 carriage house on East 36th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues that he estimates   could sell for $3.5 million.\n   Mr. Corey said he gathers his daily take-- usually about $100, though there have been $250 days-- every few months and donates the money to a charity that buys medical supplies for children in Cuba. As for the drivers he solicits, Mr. Corey said, \"I don't tell them where the money's going, and I'm sure they don't care.\"\nMr. Corey has traveled to Cuba to donate personally. There are photographs of him with President Fidel Castro on his wall. One is with an inscription  by Castro: With admiration, gratitude and affection.\nQuestion: Corey raises money in order to   _\nOptions: A: help kids in Cuba build their acting career\nB: improve some poor children's health\nC: offer medical supplies to the homeless\nD: provide the elderly with financial support",

Participants preferred time-saving products like three-in-one skincare treatments rather than separate versions after seeing the logos.\nWhen asked whether they would accept a small sum of money immediately or a larger amount in a week's time, they again chose an instant reward after being exposed to the brands. \"Fast food represents a culture of time efficiency   and instant gratification  ,\" said researcher Sanford DeVoe, professor of organizational behavior at Canada's Toronto University. \"It is promoting a general sense of haste whether time is a relevant factor in the context   or not.\"\nQuestion: Judging from the article, which of the following statements is FALSE?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Fast food increases energy levels.\"?",

Even in warm weather.\nIt is not a large quilt but very beautiful: made up of many brightly color1ed woolen squares of every imaginable color1--red, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, cream.\nFrom the start, I loved this quilt. Just to look at it is to feel comforted. How many years have passed since my mother gave the quilt to me and my husband Ray Smith? I can only guess: thirty years? thirty-five?\nThe beautiful little quilt in all the color1s of the rainbow has followed me from one house to another. The same bed, in different bedrooms in different houses in different periods of my life.\nIn this most recent period, the quilt is laid on my bed in a house in Princeton, New Jersey, into which I moved in 2009. My mother visited this house. When she'd visited Ray and me in my former home, less than five minutes from this house, Mom had always helped out in the garden; we would garden together, and we would prepare meals together, while my father, a gifted amateur pianist, played my piano in the living room. \nWhenever my parents came to visit us, my mother would bring gifts for us: mostly items she had knitted, or sewn. For years, I wore dresses and jackets my mother had sewn. There is nothing so comforting as wearing clothes your mother has sewn or knitted for you.\nIn February 2008 when my husband was in hospital, and after he died unexpectedly a week later, often I lay in bed too exhausted to move, beneath the rainbow-color1ed quilt. The bed became my shelter, and my \"nest\". My mother's quilt made me realize how love lasts in the most comforting way.\nWe desire comfort, but comfort can come to us from only a few sources. I know that I have been very fortunate. I never stop giving thanks to my wonderful parents who gave me their love, for this quilt on my bed, as special and beautiful in 2013 as it was in the late 1970s.",

However, bridge building experts thought that this was an impossible project and told Roebling to forget it. But Roebling could not ignore the vision of this bridge. After much discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington, an engineer, that the bridge could be built.\nThe father and son developed concepts of how it could be completed and how the difficulties could be overcome. After that, they began to build their dream bridge.\nThe project started well, but when it was only a few months underway   a tragic accident on the site took the life of John Roebling. Washington was also injured and left with a certain amount of brain damage,which made him unable to walk or talk or even move.\nEveryone had a negative comment since the Roeblings were the only one who knew how to build the bridge. In spite of these difficulties, Washington was never discouraged and still had a burning desire to complete the bridge. It seemed that there was a message for him not to give up. Suddenly an idea hit him. All he could do was to move one finger and he decided to make the best use of it. By moving it, he slowly developed a code of communication with his wife. Then he used the same method of tapping her arm to tell the engineers what to do. The project was underway again. For 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife's arm, until the bridge was finally completed.\nToday the Brooklyn Bridge stands in all its glory to the victory of one man's determination not to be defeated by circumstances.

If you didn't sleep for hours during the early part of the evening, you would be more ready to sleep at bedtime. If you didn't nap after dinner, you would not want to stay up so late, and you would not feel the need to take a sleeping pill. The pill is still working in your system when you get up in the morning. This helps account for the fact that you feel tired all day.\nYou should get out of the habit of sleeping during the early evening. Right after your evening meal, engage in some sort of physical activity-a sport such as bowling, perhaps. Or get together with friends for an evening of cards and conversation. Then go to bed at your usual time or a little earlier, and you should be able to get a good night's rest without taking a pill.\nIf you can get into the habit of spending your evenings this way, I am sure you will feel less tired during the day. At first it may be hard for you to go to sleep without taking a pill. If so, get up and watch television or do some jobs around your house until you feel sleepy. If you fall asleep and then wake up a few hours later, get up but do not take a sleeping pill. Read a while or listen to the radio, and make yourself a few hours' sleep that night, you will feel better in the morning than you usually feel after taking a pill.

But some slimmers take a slightly different approach -- consuming more than half their weekly calorie intake from Friday night to Sunday.\nAway from the daily routine at work that helps them keep control of what they eat, they are snacking and drinking their way to a shocking 10,000 calories, a survey has found. Almost three-quarters of people trying to lose weight admit to over-eating at the weekend. A meal with friends or family, complete with alcohol, as well as a late-night snack before bed, can lead to adults consuming up to 3,500 calories in one day, a survey found. Men typically need 2,500 calories a day and women 2,000 calories. Consuming this amount would see men and women get through half their weekly calorie intake over the course of a 'bad' weekend.\nWomen were found to eat less on a Sunday because of guilt over their consumption over the previous two days. Men had fewer doubts about a third day of excess.\nThe biggest weekend diet danger comes from snacking between meals, the survey found. Some say they will often spend Saturday night in front of the TV with their families -- combining watching their favorite shows with crisps and biscuits. And seven in ten people admitted to having fattening takeaways at weekends, with pizza the most popular. Alcohol is another big factor in weekend bingeing.Around 70 percent still like to have a roast on a Sunday or a big meal with family or friends and a third of those will have second helpings.\nA spokesman from Forza Supplements, the diet company that conducted the survey, said, \"We all have bad weekends where we have a lot of fun, but dieting goes out of the window.\"\nThe 5:2 diet is becoming increasingly popular -- where we limit our calories for five days and allow ourselves a few treats on the other two days.\n\"For many people, the two days off are Saturday and Sunday but they go way too far\"\nOptions:\nA Having a big meal with family and friends.\nB Drinking a lot.\nC Having fattening takeaways\nD Snacking between the meals.\nAnswer:\nD Snacking between the meals.\nQuestion:",

Yes, that is the Taj Mahal,one of the most famous buildings in the world. And the tale behind the construction is just as impressive as the building itself.\nFirst, there's the emperor of northern India, Shah Jehan,also called the King of the World. In 1612,Shah Jehan married Mumtaz Mahal. Madly in love, they had 14 children over the next 20 years. But then sadness came.  As Mumtaz was about to give birth to child'number 14, she said she had heard her unborn baby cry out. It was a sign of death. And as Mumtaz lay dying, she asked Jehan to build a lasting memorial to celebrate their love.\nWhen the heartbroken Jehan appeared eight days after his wife's death, his people were shocked to see that his coal-black hair had turned snow-white.\nPutting away his sadness, Jehan ordered his wife's dying wish carried out. More than 20,000 workers labored nearly 22 years to complete the construction. In 1653,Jehan placed Mumtaz's remains in the center under the building.\nAnd then, son number five, Aurangzeb, murdered his brothers and took over the power from his aging father. Hehan lived the rest of his days-eight years, to be exact-imprisoned not far from the Taj Mahal. Jehan was only allowed to climb onto the top of his prison to see the timeless\ntreasure from a distance. But never again would he be allowed to visit it--until he was buried next to his wife.\nToday 25,000 people visit the Taj Mahal each day. Though the reason for building the tower was a strange, sad story, those who see its breath-taking beauty are reminded of the happiness that inspired its construction.\nQuestion: We learn from the text that Mumtaz probably died in    _    .\nOptions: A: 1626\nB: 1632\nC: 1634\nD: 1653",

He says Arctic sea ice is already at the lowest this year and is expected to retreat  farther this month.\nThat means that polar bears--some 16,000 of them -- will disappear by 2050 from parts of the Arctic where sea ice is melting most rapidly, along the north coasts of Alaska and Russia, researchers said in a telephone briefing .\nOther polar bears could survive beyond that date but many of those could be gone by 2100, Amstrup said. By this century's end, the only polar bears left might live in the Canadian Arctic islands and along the west coast of Greenland.\n\"It is likely to result in loss of approximately two-thirds of the world's current polar bear population by the mid 21st century,\" the report's executive summary said.\n\"Because the observed trajectory of Arctic sea ice decline appears to be underestimated by currently available models, this assessment of future polar bear status may be conservative .\"\nIn January, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed listing the polar bear as a threatened species, noting polar bears depend on sea ice as a platform to hunt seals, their main food.\nWithout enough sea ice, polar bears would be forced onto land, but they are poor hunters once they get out of the water and ice, the researchers said. The bears' disappearance would probably take place as young cubs failed to survive to adulthood and females were unable to reproduce successfully.\nOptions:\nA The pollution of the Arctic region.\nB The sea ice melting at high speed\nC Fewer food sources being left.\nD The temperature getting colder.\nAnswer:\nB The sea ice melting at high speed\nQuestion:",

So, what is genetic modification? Are GM foods safe?\nThese questions have been put back into the spotlight recently. On Nov 19, the Food and Drug Administrati0n (FDA) in the US announced that it had approved the AquAdvantage salmon to go on the market, making it the first genetically modified animal to be approved as food anywhere in the world.\nGM foods are plants or animals that have been given a gene from another plant or animal to make them stronger in some way. The AquAdvantage salmon contains a gene from another type of salmon that makes it grow faster.\nAlthough the FDA has said \"food from the fish is safe to eat\", some believe that scientists can't completely understand the potential health risks of GM foods, simply because they're so new. Others worry that the fish could escape into the wild and cause ecological problems.\nGM crops have experienced the same controversy, even though GM technology cuts down on the use of pesticides on crops and increases yields.\nWhile GM animals are new, GM crops have already appeared on our plates: A total of 28 countries in the world including the US, Brazil and India planted 181.5 million hectares (1.815 million km2) of GM crops in 2014, according to the International Service for tile Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications. In China, we grow GM cotton and papaya and import GM soybeans, corn, rape, cotton and beets from abroad.\nDue to safety worries, many countries have regulations for producing and selling GM food.\nIn European Union countries, each GM food must be approved before it can be used. This process can take up to 17 months. The origin of all GM foods must also be traceable, and all food with a GM content of more than 0.9 percent must also be labeled, according to EU website europa.eu.\nThe US is less strict about GM foods. According to FDA regulations, companies introducing new GM foods to the market should report them at least 120...\nQuestion: One of the reasons for many people to worry about the AquAdvantage salmon is that  _  .\nOptions: A: the gene that makes them grow faster can work on humans too\nB: there are possible health risks that even scientists might not have figured out yet\nC: they could possibly become threats to other wild species\nD: they are not nutritious enough or might taste strange",

        "Article: Working the night shift a few nights a month can do more than leave your eyes bleary-eyed ,suggests a study on Wednesday.\n    It just might increase your risk of color1ectal cancer .Nurses who worked the night shift at least three times a month for t5 years or more were 35%more likely to develop that type of cancer than nurses who never worked nights,Harvard University researchers report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n    The finding,from the ongoing Nurses Health Study,is the first to link night shift work with a higher risk of color1ectal cancer,expected to kill 57,100 Americans this, according to the American Cancer Society.Another research,including a report out of the Nurses Health Study, has suggested that working night shifts increases women's breast cancer risk.\n    The researchers asked 78,586 nurses whether they had ever worked three or more night shifts a month.The nurses indicated whether they had done so for less than 15 years or 15 years or more.The scientists followed the women to see who developed color1ectal cancer.\n    Researchers believe that lowered levels of melatonin might increase night-shift workers' cancer risk.Melatonin levels usually reach the highest point in the middle of the night.\nTurn on the lights,though,and  _ dropped measurably in just 10 minutes,says Richard Stevens a cancer epidemiologist at the University of Connecticut who did not take part in the new study.After two weeks of continuous nightly exposure to light,humans experience a sharp drop in melatonin production,Nurses Health Study researchers write.\n   In the lab,melatonin appears to stop tumor growth.Other studies suggest that color1ectal cancer patients have lower blood levels of melatonin than healthy people,the authors write.However,that could be a result of the disease,not a cause of it.Stevens says.\nQuestion: According to Nurses Health Study,which of the following statements is NOT true?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Nurses who don't work at night don't suffer color1ectal cancer.\"?",

Gallaudet is said to be the world's only liberal arts university where everything is designed for deaf or hard-of-hearing students.About 2,000 students attend Gallaudet.The cost for international students is about 33,000 dollars a year.\nFinancial aid is available in the form of scholarships,but only after the first year of studies. Most scholarship aid goes to students in financial need who do well in their first year.One scholarship for international students is for deaf students from developing countries.Another is just for students from China.The university also offers an English Language Institute.But Gallaudet says this program does not guarantee  acceptance to the university.\nIn the past year,students at Gallaudet protested against the administration's choice of a new president for the university.The protests led to the choice of a different president who is more popular with the students,Robert Davila.He is a former officer of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf.This technical college is in Rochester, New York.  It is one of the eight colleges in the Rochester Institute of Technology.\nMore than one thousand students attend the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. About one hundred of them are international students.They come from Africa, Asia,Europe and South America.\nThe cost is about 28,000 dollars a year for an international Technical Institute student.Foreign graduate students pay about 20,000 dollars.  Both undergraduate and graduate student can receive limited financial aid. They can also take part in the student employment program.This program makes it possible for students to work at the school.\nQuestion: To those who study in Gallaudet,   _    .\nAnswer:",

Although I was very successful in other sports, particularly soccer and baseball, I was only a mediocre basketball player. I remember walking into the gymnasium and feeling shocked when I saw how many people were also trying out. I knew I was a good athlete, but I didn't know if my skill would be as good as the other participants.\nTry-outs lasted for four long days. At the end of each day, the basketball coach had a short discussion with each player. He told some of the players to come back for the next day, and told other players that they had not made the team. This is called getting cut. All of us were afraid of getting cut at the end of each practice.\nOn the fourth day of try-outs there were only twenty kids left. I was one of them, but we all knew only eighteen students would make the team. This day was the most intense day of them all. There were many opportunities to impress the coach but there were so few people that the pressure was very high. I was not one of the best players on the team, so I was especially worried on this last day. At the end of practice the coach told every player to take one shot from the same spot. Many kids missed their shot but mine went in the basket.\nAfter practice we waited as the coach talked to each player. When my turn finally came my heart skipped a beat when I walked towards the coach. My head was spinning when the coach started speaking and I was almost shaking because I was anxious. The coach told me that I had done very well and that he was impressed. However, the team only eighteen spots and unfortunately none of these would be mine.\nQuestion: What is the author's goal in this story?\n- To play basketball everyday after school\n- To improve his skill at basketball\n- To join the school's basketball team\n- To play basketball, soccer, and baseball.",

That's because Ashlyn, 13, can't feel pain. That might sound like a cool superpower. But without pain, everyday activities can be hazardous for Ashlyn. In fact, they could kill her.\nWhen Ashlyn was born, no one knew that she couldn't feel pain. But soon there was hints that something was wrong. When Ashlyn's teeth grew in, she almost chewed off part on her tongue. Ashlyn's parents took her to doctor for tests. The doctors discovered that Ashlyn couldn't feel pain, a condition called congenital insensitivity to pain(CIPA). Fewer than 100 people in the United States have it. There is no cure. .\n\"Sometimes it's frustrating,\" she admits.\nBut Ashlyn doesn't let anything stop her from doing things she wants to do. \"I just have to be careful,\" she says.\nFor years, Ashlyn didn't know anyone else who had CIPA. That made it harder to deal with her condition. \"I felt alone,\" she says.\nOne night she dreamed that there was a camp for kids like her. In 2011, Ashly's mom made the dream come true. She started Camp Painless But Hopeless.\nThe camp is for children who have CIPA. Every November, they and their families spend four days together.\nThe campers get to do daring activities like rock climbing--wearing safety equipment.\nSomeday, Ashlyn wants to be a director at the camp so she can help others who can't feel pain.

It means that you must have he ability to love and accept yourself in order to form and keep satisfying relationship with others self-esteem means accepting yourself for who you really are, and believing that you are indeed a worthwhile person who is deserving of love and respect from others.\nSelf-esteem is our sense of how good we feel about ourselves. It is based on our judgment of ourselves, not on other people's assessment, but simply on our own. Our self-esteem is not dependant on our talent. Some very ordinary people feel very good about themselves, while other extraordinarily high achievers hold low opinions of themselves.\nSelf-esteem is the primary key to long-term stress management. Why? The first three sources of stress are: predictable life event, unexpected changes and build-up of daily stresses, These are much easier to handle when we believe in ourselves, A positive, healthy self-esteem gives us the \"hardiness\"  to deal with the difficulties of life, and to see them as challenges to be met, rather than threats to be feared.\nThe forth category of stress is entirely the result of a low self-esteem.

Maybe it was the gentleness of their difficult experiences or an unclear familiarity   with the situation that drew my full attention. I immediately had a strong wish to do something for them.

After being stranded in heavy ice for five days, the ship had broken free by Tuesday evening and was making its way through lighter ice, China Central Television reported on Tuesday.\nThe vessel, which had been conducting China's 30th Antarctic expedition before going to the aid of the Russian ship Akademik Shokalskiy, will now continue with its scheduled activities. The trapped Russian ship was also trying to free itself on Tuesday, with the favorable west wind loosening the surrounding ice, according to CCTV.

        "Read the article and select the best answer.\nArticle: The behaviour of a building's users may be at least as important as its design when it comes to energy use, according to new research from the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC). The UK promises to reduce its carbon emissions  by 80 percent by 2050, part of which will be achieved by all new homes being zero-carbon by 2016. But this report shows that sustainable building design on its own -- though extremely important- is not enough to achieve such reductions: the behaviour of the people using the building has to change too.\nThe study suggests that the ways that people use and live in their homes have been largely ignored by existing efforts to improve energy efficiency  , _ instead focus on architectural and technological developments.\n'Technology is going to assist but it is not going to do everything,'explains Katy Janda, a UKERC senior researcher,'consumption patterns of building users can defeat the most careful design. 'In other words,old habits die hard, even in the best-designed eco-home.\nAnother part of the problem is information. Households and bill-payers don't have the knowledge they need to change their energy-use habits. Without specific information,it's hard to estimate the costs and benefits of making different choices. Feedback   facilities, like smart meters and energy monitors,could help bridge this information gap by helping people see how changing their behaviour directly affects their energy use; some studies have shown that households can achieve up to 15 percent energy savings using smart meters.\nSocial science research has added a further dimension  ,suggesting that individuals'behaviour in the home can be personal and cannot be predicted  whether people throw open their windows rather than turn down the thermostat   , for example.\nJanda argues that education is the key. She calls for a focused programme to teach people about buildings and their own behaviour in them.\nQuestion: The information gap in energy use   _  .\nOptions: A: can be bridged by feedback facilities\nB: affects the study on energy monitors\nC: brings about problems for smart meters\nD: will be caused by building users' old habits",

It can spread from one person to another, according to the recent research that stresses the power of one person's emotions to affect even people they don't know.\nThe new analysis, involving 4,793 people who were interviewed every two years between 2005 and 2015, showed that a friend of a lonely person was 52% more likely to develop feelings of loneliness by the time of the next interview. A friend of that person was 25% more likely, and a friend of a friend of a friend was 15% more likely.\n''Loneliness is not just the property of an individual. It can be transmitted across people--even people you don't have direct contact with,\" said John T. Cacioppo, a psychologist of University of Chicago who led the study published in the December issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.\nLoneliness has been linked to medical problems, including depression, sleep problems and generally poorer physical health. Identifying some of the causes could help reduce the emotion and improve health, experts said.\nAlthough the study did not examine how loneliness spreads, Cacioppo said another research has provided clues. \"Let's say for whatever reason you get lonely. You then interact with other people in a more negative fashion. That puts them in a negative mood and makes them more likely to interact with other people in a negative fashion and they _ their social ties and become lonely,\" Cacioppo said.\nAccording to Cacioppo, loneliness spread more easily among women than men, perhaps because women were more likely to express emotions.\nLonely people become less and less trusting others. This makes it more and more difficult for them to make friends--and more likely that society will reject them. Therefore, it is important to recognize and deal with loneliness. Cacioppo emphasizes people who have been pushed to the edges of society should receive help to repair their social networks.",

You might even drive a flying car!\nFor each prediction that has come true today, several others have missed by a mile. Many of these predictions didn't consider how people would want to use the technology. Or if people really needed it in their lives or not. Let's look at some predictions from the not - too - distant past.\nRobot Helpers\nWhere's the robot in my kitchen? Nowhere, of course. And he's probably not coming anytime soon. Robots do exist today, but mostly in factories and other Manufacturing environments.\nBack in the 1950s, however, people said that by now personal robots would be in most people's home.\nSo why hasn't happened? Probably because robots are still too expensive and Clumsy. And maybe the idea of robots cooking our dinners and washing our clothes is just too  _ . At home we seem to be doing fine without them.\nTelephones of tomorrow?\nIn 1964 an American company introduced the video telephone. They said by the year 2000 most people would have a video phone in their homes. But of course the idea hasn't caught on yet.\nWhy? The technology worked fine, but it overlooked something obvious: peoples desire for privacy. Would you want to have a video phone conversation with someone after you just stepped out of the shower?\nProbably not - it could be embarrassing! Just because a technology is available doesn't always mean people will want to use it.\nAnd finally, how about that crazy prediction of the flying car? It's not so crazy anymore! But a flying car remains one of the most fascinating technology ideas to capture our imagination. Keep watching the news - or perhaps the sky outside your window - to see what the future will bring.\nQuestion: What does the author think of the flying car?\nOptions: A: It is too difficult to imagine.\nB: It is too crazy an idea.\nC: It is likely to be made.\nD: It is often reported in the news.",

Traditionally,in the Chinese mind,\"yin si\" is associated with(...)what is closed or unfair. If someone is said to have \"yin si\",meddlers will be attracted to pry into his or her things. So people always say that they don't have \"yin si\".\nOn the contrary, Americans often declare  intention to protect their privacy. Their understanding of privacy is that others have no right to pry into things which belong to themselves alone and have nothing to do with others. One who is too curious  and who spreads rumors is said to violate  the right to privacy.\nIn the evening, Sonia and I went to a bar for dinner. In China, when people mention bars, something bad usually comes to mind. But here,the bar was a quiet and tastefully laidout place. People spoke quite softly, afraid of interrupting their neighbors, and sat face to face as they drank, sometimes three or five persons sitting together.\nThis sort of atmosphere was totally different from my preconception , so I wanted to take a picture. Sonia stopped me, \"Don't you see these people are pouring out their hearts? Maybe they are colleagues, friends, secret lovers. They came here looking for a peaceful place free from interruption by others. They wouldn't want to leave any trace  of their having come here. So taking their pictures would be a serious violation of their right to privacy.\"\nIs there privacy between husband and wife? One of Sonia's friends married a talented Chinese man,but recently she became so angry that she wanted a divorce .The reason was that her husband had opened one of her letters and looked through her purse. The husband didn't realize that this is not tolerated  in the U.S.. He thought that being a couple was like being one person; why couldn't he see the letter or the contents of the purse? Truly, everyone, even those living as a couple, needs room--not only in threedimensional  space, but in the heart.\nQuestion: One of Sonia's friends wanted a divorce because  _  .\nOptions: A: she thought her husband was not clever enough\nB: her husband always opened her letters\nC: her husband always looked through her purse\nD: her husband didn't respect her right to privacy",

I don't even give it a second thought. In China, it's a whole other story! Here, ordering is a fun game of trial and error, and the adventure begins before the food is even served!\nMany restaurants in central Beijing advertise \"English language menus\", but the translations can just add to the confusion. Although accompanying pictures can be a helpful relief, the translations often make the whole experience even more amusing. During my first few weeks in China I tried some delicious dishes with strange names. As an experiment, my friends and I would order things like \"students addicted to chicken gristle  \" and \"red burned lion head\". It was always fun to see what landed on our table. Eventually we learned that \"lion head\" was actually pork, and \"students\" are \"addicted\" to diced   chicken with green pepper.\nRecently, I came across a busy restaurant down a narrow side street in a Beijing hutong. It was lunchtime and the small room was packed with people sitting on small stools   eating noodles. I was hungry and cold, and the steaming bowls looked irresistible! I sat myself down and called out for a \"caidan!\" In response, the waitress pointed to a wall at the back of the restaurant. The wall was full of Chinese characters describing numerous dishes. There was only one sentence in English: \"crossing over the bridge noodles\".\nI had never heard of the dish and had no idea what it would taste like. I took a gamble and ordered one bowl of \"crossing over the bridge noodles\". A few minutes later the waitress carried over a heavy bowl full of broth   and I quickly dug in. It was the best bowl of noodles I had ever tasted! I have been back again and again and each time I point at the one English sentence - \"crossing over the bridge noodles\". I always enter a restaurant in China feeling excited and a little nervous.

But recently the black mountain has become a tourist draw, thanks to a newly invented extreme sport: volcano boarding.\nThousands of thrill-seekers have climbed to the top of Cerro Negro, peered into its mouth, then zipped down its rough-and--rocky 41--degree slope on special boards. The volcano-boarding speed, set by an Israeli woman, is 54 mph.\n\"Rushing down an active volcano is something that people expect.\" Said Anthony   Alcalde, an expert volcano boarder. The sport was developed in the mid-2000s by Darryn Webb, an Australian who had climbed the nearby Cerro Negro but was looking for a faster way to get to the bottom. He tried sliding down on surfboards, snowboards, and even a refrgerrator door before inventing a sit-down board made of plywood.\n\"At first, Darryn planned to use a snowboard,\" said Gemma Cope, a British woman who now runs Big Foot, which offers volcano boarding tours. \"But he realized he couldn't cut an edge for there were little rocks everywhere. So he came up with the sitting-down option and realized he can go pretty fast. \" \nTourists,who are nearly all foreigners,pay $28 for the experience, which begins with a truck ride on dirt roads to Cerro Negr0.a 2,400-foot--high volcano that last erupted in l999.Visitors must carry their boards during the half-hour climb to the top. There,they go straight down the slope and sometimes they have to use their feet for brakes.Along the way.The board fills with rocks and dust,making boarders almost blind.Crashes are common.\"l wiped out twice and ripped my pants.\"said Melinda Vorisek, a tourist from Miami.\"But I'd do it again.\" Another tourist added:\"It was sheer terror.

David had trouble breathing after he ate the cookie, but his mother knew what to do and she quickly gave him medicine that helped him feel better almost right away. The body's reaction to certain foods can be quite severe, resulting in breathing problems, as in David's case, or loss of consciousness for some. There are many things we eat may cause our bodies to react badly if we have a food allergy . The most common food allergies seem to be related to milk, soy, eggs, wheat flour, peanuts, nuts, and seafood. In fact, these kinds of foods account for 90% of food allergies.\nAccording to some studies, the number of children who have a food allergy is growing. But some people now argue that test results might not actually be accurate, so food allergies are not really as common as they may appear.\nThere are three typical ways that doctors test for food allergies. Probably the most accurate way is for a doctor to give a child a  food challenge\", For this, the doctor watches the child eat small amounts of certain foods to see if the child has an allergic reaction or not. This method is very time consuming so it is used less often than the other two methods: skin tests and blood tests. In a skin test, a doctor puts very small amounts of the parts of the foods that the child may be allergic to under the child's skin, then watches to see if the child's skin reacts to the allergens . In a blood test, doctors take some of the child's blood and add possible allergens to it and then look for chemicals in the blood that indicate a possible allergic reaction.\nA problem with both the skin test and the blood test is that neither will show how severe an allergic reaction might be. If a test result is positive, the child may have a severe reaction by eating this food, but the child might just as likely...\nOptions:\nA Doctors know clearly why the number of food allergies is increasing.\nB Allergies affect the digestive system more than the immune system\nC Allergy test in fact makes little sense\nD The more children expose themselves to germs, the better their immune system works.\nAnswer:\nC Allergy test in fact makes little sense\nQuestion:",

But a new study suggests that calling attention to the words and letters on the page may lead to better readers.\nThe two-year study compared children who were read in this way in class with children who were not. Those whose teachers most often discussed the print showed clearly higher skills in reading, spelling and understanding. These results were found one year and even two years later.\nShayne Piasta, an assistant professor of teaching and learning at Ohio State University, was an author of the study. She says most pre-school teachers would find this method manageable and would need only a small change in the way they teach. They already read story-books in class. The only difference would be increased attention to the printed text. \"If you get children to pay attention to letters and words, it makes sense that they will do better at word recognition and spelling.\" But she says research suggests that very few parents and teachers do this in a systematic way.\nMore than 300 children aged four and five were observed in classrooms. They came from poor families and were below average in their language skills. For thirty weeks, the children took part in a program called Project STAR--- Sit Together and Read. The project is based at Ohio State. It tests the short-term and long-term results of reading regularly to pre-school children in their classrooms.\nThere are different ways that adults can talk to children about print. They can point to a letter and discuss it, and even trace the shape with a finger. They can point out a word and discuss the meaning of the print or how the words tell the story. And they can talk about the organization of the print--- for instance, showing how words are written left to right in English.\nQuestion: Which of the following is TRUE about the study on language skills of pre-school children?\n- Many teachers want to change their way of teaching pre-school children.\n- Attention on the pictures has made the children uninterested in reading.\n- Project STAR aims to research into the results of reading books to pre-school children in the classroom.\n- Teachers are often prevented from taking different approaches to language teaching.",

Worried, he spoke to his father about all this, though he was afraid that maybe he would be laughed at for having such worries.

        "Picture this scene, a 6-year-old girl is alone on a raft, with no lifejacket, 200 yards from the shore with the winds whipping up the water. She is pointing at her cousins, and yelling out, \"They are drowning!\" Your eyes scan left only to see a three-year-old above the surface of the water and you realize two hands are holding her up, the hands of 14-year-old Mallory, who is struggling below the surface of the water.\nThree seventeen-year-olds from Salt Lake City, Tiana Skeen, Caitlin Caldwell and Jessica Osterloh, were on the lake for fun in the sun at Bear Lake when they heard the cry for help and saw this terrifying scene. The teens witnessed the three young girls in this very dangerous situation. The teens reacted quickly and swam out to save the girls while crying out toward jet skiers and people on the beach for help. Fourteen-year-old Mallory was struggling to hold her little cousin Rylee above water. The teens rescued Rylee just in time but couldn't find Mallory. Meanwhile, 6-year-old Sydney was floating away on the raft with no lifejacket. The girls flagged down a jet ski to get her and bring her back to the beach.\nThe three teen heroines   saved the 3-year-old and the 6-year-old, but they feel Mallory is the real heroine, as she held her 3-year-old cousin above the water until the teens were able to rescue Rylee. Mallory was finally found, but she died on the way to the hospital.\nNow, the teen heroines strongly remind everyone to wear a life jacket when on the water.\nWhat's the best title for this passage?\nA) A dangerous experience\nB) Bear Lake\nC) A life jacket\nD) Three teen heroines",

        "\"I had a test and didn't want to do it, so I pretended to be ill\", says 13-year-old Mary. But Mary did not enjoy her day off. \"It was boring. I wished I had gone to school.\"\nMary's story is not unusual in Britain. According to the latest government figures, pupil absences are rising, despite schools _ truancy  .\nDr Philip James from Cardiff University thinks she knows why: \"As schools make more efforts to find and punish missing students, students find better ways to avoid being caught.\"\nFor several years, James has researched teenager truancy and discovered that most truancy was \"a response to factors within the school\". Students that skip school are not necessarily less advanced or less intelligent. They complained of teachers who failed to engage them, and of \"boring\" lessons. \"Many of them really enjoy school and believe in education, but drop out when aspects of it are ineffective.\" James says.\nThe views of students like Adam, who believes that skipping lessons has little impact on his schooling, are common. \"I only take off for a lesson, or a couple of days. It doesn't affect my education,\" he told James.\nJames believes that schools need to address the question of why pupils want to leave in the first place. \"Pupils need help from the start.\" she says. \"Schools need to look at the reasons for truancy rather than the number, so that instead of walking away from school, students have the skills and chances to talk through problems and make a change.\"\nWhat does Dr James suggest schools do about truancy?\nA) Fire all their unqualified teachers.\nB) Improve communication with students.\nC) Develop better ways to discover truancy.\nD) Introduce more serious punishments.",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article:\nArticle: Biologists believe that love is fundamentally a biological rather than a cultural construct, because the capacity for love is found in all human cultures and similar behavior is found in some other animals. In humans the purpose of all the desire is to focus attention on the raising of offspring. Children demand an unusual amount of parenting, and two parents are better than one. Love is a signal that both partners are committed, and makes it more likely that this commitment will continue as long as necessary for children to reach independence. But what does science have to say about the notion of love at first sight?\nIn recent years the ability to watch the brain in action has offered a wealth of insight into the mechanics of love. Researchers have shown that when a person falls in love, a dozen different part of brain work together to release chemicals that trigger feelings of euphoria, bonding and excitement. It has also been shown that the unconditional love between a mother and a child is associated with activity in different regions of the brain from those associated with pair-bonding love.\nPassionate love is rooted in the reward circuitry of the brain--the same area that is active when humans feel a rush from cocaine. In fact, the desire, motivations and withdrawals involved in love have a great deal in common with addiction. Its most intense forms tend to be associated with the early stages of a relationship, which then give way to a calmer attachment form of love one feels with a long term partner.\nWhat all this means is that one special person can become chemically rewarding to the brain of another. Love at first sight, then, is only possible if the mechanism for generating long-term attachment can be triggered quickly. There are signs that it can be. One line of evidence is that people are able to decide within a second how attractive they find another person. This decision appears to be related to facial attractiveness, although men may favor women with waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7, no matter what...",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: Over the past century, all kinds of unfairness and discrimination have been made illegal. But one popular form continues to exist, that is alphabetism  . This, for those as yet unaware of such a disadvantage, refers to discrimination against those whose surnames begin with a letter in the lower half of the alphabet.\nIt has long been known that the cars of a taxi firm called AAAA have a big advantage over Zodiac cars when customers look through their phone directories. Less well known is the advantage that Adam Abbot has in life over Zoe Zysman. English names are fairly spread between the halves of the alphabet. Yet a quite large number of top people have surnames beginning with letters between A and K.\nThus the American presidents and vice-presidents have surnames starting with B and  C separately and 26 of those before George Bush took office (including his father ) had surnames in the first half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even more striking, six of the seven heads of government of the G7 rich countries are alphabetically advantaged (Berlusconi, Blair, Bush, Chirac, Chretien and Koizumi). The world's three top central bankers ( Greenspan, Duisenberg and Hayami)are all close to the top of the alphabet, even if one of them really uses Japanese characters. The same case are the world's five richest men ( Gates, Buffet and so on) .\nCan this merely happen by chance? At the start of the first year in primary school, teachers seat pupils, alphabetically from the front, to make it easier to remember their names. So shortsighted and small-sized Zysman junior gets stuck in the back row, and is seldom asked the improving questions by those teachers. At that time the alphabetically disadvantaged may think they have had a lucky escape. Yet the result may be worse qualifications, because they get less attention, as well as less confidence in speaking publicly.\nThe unfairness continues. At university graduation parties, the ABCs proudly get their awards first. However, by the time they reach the...\nQuestion: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?\nOptions: A: VIPs in the western world gain a great deal from alphabetism.\nB: People with surnames beginning with N to Z are often misunderstood.\nC: Putting things alphabetically may lead to unintentional unfairness.\nD: The movement to get rid of alphabetism still has a long way to go.",

The prizes are ultimately funded by the taxpayer, through school budgets. Nearly 500 secondary schools, one in six, have decided to take part in the scheme, which is intended to replace old-style rewards such as stickers and golden stars.\nBut the extent of rewards being offered in schools brought a warning that a generation of children is growing up expecting to be rewarded at every stage. Many youngsters are collecting points for ordinary achievements such as remembering to bring their PE kit and wearing the correct uniform.\nUnder the scheme, teachers award Vivo points--worth 1 penny each--according to the school's policy. Schools typically spendPS4 toPS6 on prizes per pupil each year, although some commit considerably more. Most pupils accumulate between 400 and 600 Vivos a year. Vivo Miles insists it is \"pretty rare\" for a pupil to accumulate enough points to buy an iPod, which requires 3,100 Vivos.\nBut Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the scheme amounted to \"bribery\". \"It misleads children into thinking anything which requires effort has to have a special reward,\" he said. \"This 'all must have prizes' view is damaging to children in the long-term.\" The scheme amounted to an \"admission of failure\" by schools. He said. \"It shows a school has failed to convince children education is important.\"\nQuestion: What's the writer's attitude towards the scheme?\n- Supportive.\n- Opposed.\n- Unconcerned.\n- Objective.",

I was familiar with Lisa from her show on Lifetime, and since I was eager to get a sign from my father, I agreed to go.\nI took my father's gold watch and listened as Lisa helped audience members communicate with their loved ones. \"I have a grandfather-like figure with me and he is speaking about his granddaughter Jilly,\" she announced.

While waiting at a traffic light, they saw a black Mercedes Coupe on one side and a homeless man begging for food on the other.\n\"Dad, if that man had a less nice car, that man there could have a meal.\"Hannah protested. The light changed and they drove on, but Hannah was too young to be reasonable. She pestered  her parents about _ insisting that she wanted to do something.\n\"What do you want to do?\" her mom responded. \"Sell our house?\"\nWarning! _ . Hannah seized upon the idea of selling the luxurious family home and donating half the proceeds to charity, while using the other half to buy a more modest replacement home.\nEventually, that's what the family did. The project --crazy, impetuous   and utterly inspiring -- is written down in detail in a book by father and daughter scheduled to be published next month: \"The Power of Half.\" It's a book that, frankly, I'd be nervous about leaving around where my own teenage kids might find it. An impressionable child reads this, and the next thing you know your whole family is out on the street.\nAt a time of enormous needs in Haiti and elsewhere, when so many Americans are trying to help Haitians by sending everything from text messages to shoes, the Salwens offer an example of a family that came together to make a difference -- for themselves as much as the people they were trying to help. In a column a week ago, it described neurological evidence from brain scans that unselfishness lights up parts of the brain normally associated with more primary satisfaction. The Salwens' experience confirms the selfish pleasures of selflessness.\nMr. Salwen and his wife, Joan, had always assumed that their kids would be better off in a bigger house. But after they downsized, there was much less space to retreat to, so the family members spent more time around each other. A smaller house unexpectedly turned out to be a more family-friendly house.\nQuestion: The best title for the passage should be \"  _  \".\nYes or no, is the answer \"Somewhat Crazy but Inspiring\"?",

What should our attitude to beggars be? There can be no question that the world is full of terribly sad stories. It must be terrible to have no idea where our next meal is going to come from. It seems cruel not to give some money to beggars.\nCertainly, most of the world's great religions order us to be open-hearted and share what we have with those less fortunate than ourselves. _ ? Maybe what was    morally right in the old days, when one knew exactly who in the village had suffered  misfortune and needed help, is no longer the best idea. Quite a few people will not give to beggars.     Let us look at their arguments.\nFirst, some believe that many city beggars dress up on purpose to look pitiable and actually make a good living from begging. Giving to beggars only encourages this sort of evil .\nSecondly, there is the worry that the money you give will be spent on beer, wine or drugs.\nThirdly, there is the opinion that there is no real excuse for begging. One might be poor, but that is no reason for losing one's sense of pride and self-dependence.\nThere is an opinion that the problem should be dealt with by the government rather than ordinary people. Some people think the local government department should help the beggars\nIt is hard to come to any final conclusion: there are various cases and we must deal with them differently. A few coins can save a life in some situations, and even if the money is wasted, that does not take away the moral goodness of the giver.\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT mentioned in the passage?\nOptions: A: Some people dress up to pretend to be beggars.\nB: Some beggars have no excuse for begging.\nC: Some beggars use the money to buy drugs.\nD: Some beggars need money for their children's schooling.",

The answer is probably as simple as the fact that people change.Over time, the new replaces the old.People are influenced greatly by popular culture, including athletes, musicians, movies stars, as well as popular films, television shows, books and music.We are also influenced by the fashion industry's advertising.\nThe stars of popular culture are always searching for a new angle to maintain their popularity.Often these new angles come in the form of new clothing or hairstyles.When people see these new styles, they often want to imitate their favorite stars.To do so, they seek out the latest fashions to make themselves look like the people they want to imitate.In this way, fashions evolve and change over time.\nClothes have been used to separate people into groups for many years.Even today, brand-name, clothing that is more expensive than other types of clothing can be used by some people to distinguish themselves from others.\nUnfortunately, this can often have the effect of distancing certain groups from others.Don't forget that it's always OK to develop your own sense of style that is unique and separate from what the fashion world determines! Stay true to yourself and let your personality--not your clothes--speak for who you are!\nOptions:\nA fashion is all about clothes\nB clothes may separate and distance people\nC the author has gone out of fashion\nD people like imitating others' dressing style\nAnswer:\nB clothes may separate and distance people\nQuestion:",

He supported the family, moved us to Merrick on Long Island, when I was 11. He just recently died at age 96. He was still driving and playing golf right to the end. He was the only guy I knew who at age 90 could shoot under his age. I guess that taught me something about perseverance. \nI went to the University of Michigan as an engineering student in 1960. I was standing outside the student union building when Senator John F. Kennedy made a campaign speech that essentially announced his plan for the Peace Corps. He talked about how students could provide service for the country. It was an important moment for me. \nAfter I graduated, I worked as a computer programmer for I.B.M. for two years. By then, the Vietnam War was in full swing and the draft  had accelerated. I didn't agree with the war and was interested in finding alternatives. I.B.M. applied for a delay for me twice but the application failed. \nI went to work at M.I.T.'s Instrumentation Labs on a project designed to create a rescue vehicle for lost submarines . I thought this job would keep me out of the draft, but M.I.T. hadn't put in the proper paperwork and I got called in for my physical. The day before my physical, I broke my ankle playing tennis and, of course, my draft board didn't believe a word of it. I had to provide X-rays. I had tears in my eyes from the pain, but a smile on my face. \nI started John Snow Inc. in 1978 (Dr. Snow is considered the father of modern epidemiology because he traced the source of a cholera epidemic in the 1850s). We had a very clear vision of what we would be. It would not be about making the most money but having the most impact. \nMy goal was to attract talented people who had that passion to focus on primary care, women's health, child health, and to do great work.\nI also run a nonprofit called World Education, which focuses on literacy.

To help spread the power of the afternoon nap, we list some common misunderstandings about napping we still hear.\nMisunderstanding # 1 : Napping is only for the lazy.\nFact: Around a third of American adults nap on the average day, and for good reason: A short nap can improve everything from alertness  and memory to creativity and productivity . And none of these sounds like laziness to us!\nMisunderstanding # 2 : If I take a nap, I'll only wake up feeling worse.\nFact: That weak feeling after you wake up from a nap is real (it even has a name: sleep inertia), but it's not a guarantee . How you feel after your nap is a factor of how long you sleep. Experts generally agree that a nap should last no longer than 30 minutes. \"If it takes longer than 30 minutes, you end up in deep sleep. You're going into a stage of sleep where you find it very difficult to wake up.\" said sleep expert Michael J. Breus, Ph. D. Next time you're in the mood for a nap, set your alarm for 20 to 30 minutes, tops.\nMisunderstanding # 3 : You mustn't nap at work.\nFact: In fact, in the office environment, we're all for catching a few winks   during the workday. Some companies have even created special rooms for afternoon naps as more and more employers come around to the idea that a well-rested workforce is a more productive workforce. If your employer doesn't offer a place to lay your head, try to find an empty conference room where you can close the door and turn off the lights. Really want. You can also take a nap during your lunch break on a park bench or in your car.\nMisunderstanding # 4 : I'll be more productive if I just finish this task, rather than waste time sleeping.\nFact: Yes, you'll be away from your desk if you spend 10 to 30 minutes sleeping. But you'll likely make up for that \"wasted\" time afterward. \"My research shows that people feel tired after a long time of work during the day,\" Sara Mednick told Bloomberg...\nQuestion: Sara Mednick indicates that   _  .\n- taking a short nap at work is a waste of time\n- people become less productive without a nap\n- people become less productive after a nap\n- napping is only for the lazy and young children",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: Imagine a world in which there were suddenly no emotion -- a world in which human beings could feel no love or happiness, no terror or hate.Try to imagine the consequences of such a transformation.People might not be able to stay alive: knowing neither joy nor pleasure, anxiety nor fear, they would be as likely to repeat acts that hurt them as acts that were beneficial.They could not learn: they could not benefit from experience because this emotionless world would lack rewards and punishments.Society would soon disappear: people would be as likely to harm one another as to provide help and support.Human relationships would not exist: in a world without friends or enemies, there could be no marriage, affection among companions, or bonds among members of groups.Society's economic underpinnings   would be destroyed: since earning $10 million would be no more pleasant than earning $10, there would be no incentive   to work.In fact, there would be no incentives of any kind, for as we will see, incentives mean a capacity to enjoy them.\nIn such a world, the chances that the human species would survive are next to zero, because emotions are the basic instruments of our survival and adaptation.Emotions structure the world for us in important ways.As individuals, we categorize objects on the basis of our emotions.True, we consider the length, shape, size or texture, but an object's physical aspects are less important than what it has done or can do to us -- hurt us, surprise us, anger us or make us joyful.We also use categorizations colored by emotions in our families, communities, and overall society.Out of our emotional experience with objects and events comes a social feeling of agreement that certain things and actions are \"good\" and others are \"bad\", and we apply these categories to every aspect of our social life -- from what foods we eat and what clothes we wear to how we keep promises and which people our group will accept.In fact, society uses our emotional reactions and attitudes, such as loyalty, morality,...\nQuestion: In can be inferred from the passage that the economic foundation of society is dependent on   _  .\nOptions: A: the ability to make money\nB: the capacity to work\nC: the motivation to work\nD: our emotional experiences",

Researchers at the Australian National University in Canberra compared the mental health of more than 7,000 working age Australians. They found that those with jobs had an average score of 75 in a test of mental well-being. Jobless people averaged 68.5. If you remained unemployed a long term it lowered your mental health score by 1.1 points. But getting a poor quality job lowered your score ever further - by 5.6 points.\n         The results suggest that having a bad job may be worse for your mental health than having no job at all.\n         So what is a bad job? According to the study it's one where you have little control over decision-making; the job makes heavy demands on you; there's no job security; and you feel underpaid.\n         My advice would be that if a reasonable offer of employment comes along, seize it. If you discover that you don't like the work, that's OK. You've given it your best shot and discovered that this type of work isn't for you.\n         In my own case my first job was as a trainee social worker. I very quickly learned that I was too young, too inexperienced and innocent to become a social worker. I cut my losses and tried something else. I worked as an economic researcher - and was miserable.\n         These experiences taught me that I was a person. But from my short time as a trainee social worker I had discovered an ability for interviewing people and writing reports. That led finally to journalism. So take up that first job offer and find out about the world of work. If you realize the job isn't what you expected, that's OK. Look around for something else.\n         So I disagree that a bad job is worse than no work at all. Remember, it's always easier to find a job if you are already in work.\nQuestion: What could be the best title of the text?\n- Hang on to that bad job for now\n- A bad job lowers mental score\n- A miserable economic researcher\n- Good jobs make heavy demands",

        "Read the article and select the best answer.\nArticle: A weather map is an important tool for geographers.   A succession of three or four maps presents continuous picture of weather changes. Weather forecasters are able to determine the speed of air masses and fronts   to determine whether an individual pressure aroa is deepening or becoming shallow and whether a front is increasing or decreasing in intensity  .They are also able to determine whether an air mass is retaining its original characteristics or taking on those of the surface over which it is moving. Thus, a most significant function of the map is to reveal a summary picture of conditions in the atmosphere at a given time.\nAll students of geography should be able to interpret a weather map accurately.Weather maps contain an enormous amount of information about weather conditions existing at the time of observation over a large geographical area. They reveal in a few minutes what otherwise would take hours to describe. The United States  Weather Bureau issues information about approaching storms, floods, frosts and all climatic conditions in general. Twice a month it issues a 30-day\"outlook\" which is a rough guide to weather conditions likely to occur over broad areas of the United States. These 30-day outlooks are based upon an anaiysis of the upper air levels which often set the stage for development of air masses, fronts and storms.\nConsiderable effort is being exerted today to achieve more accurate weather\npredictions, with identifying and tracking storms over regions which have but few meteorological  stations. Extensive experiments are also in progress for weathef modification studies.\nQuestion: You may possibly read this article in  _  .\nOptions: A: a magazine\nB: newspaper\nC: a novel\nD: a science book",

The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.\nAlong with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the \"splint\" with a 3-D printer.\n\"It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,\" Green told NPR.\nOn January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?\nThough he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.\nAs Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.\n3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.\n\"We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,\" Green said. \"And we're able to do things that were never possible before.\"\nQuestion: What does the author mainly talk about in the passage?\nOptions: A: The introduction of 3-D printing technology by medical workers.\nB: The development of 3-D printing technology by engineers.\nC: The use of 3-D printing technology in saving a baby.\nD: The Potential of 3-D printing technology in surgery.",

Now, four scientists say they have discovered something in lava that will help do this.

Since then, more explosions have killed 43 people and destroyed the homes of more than 2,000 others. The volcano is still active today. \nThe scientists say the lava of the volcano contains high level of an element ,which is a sign of the presence of the lava from deep in the earth, not from the surface. They say it shows that the lava coming directly from inside the earth is connected with huge explosions instead of smaller ones. \nThe scientists examined the lava from 18 explosions of Mount Unzen that took place during many thousands of years. They also studied the lava from other volcanoes in the area that are older than Mount Unzen. The lava studied came from both large and small explosions. The scientists found that large explosions contained more of the element than small ones.

Then he pulled himself to his feet, walked unsteadily a few yards through the woods and fell again.\nAfter we got him out, we went back to find the gun that he had thrown down. His tracks showed that for two days he had circled in the forest, within 200 yards of the road. His senses were so dulled by fear and tiredness that he did not hear the cars going by or see the lights at night.\nWe found him just in time.\nThis man, like others before him, had simply been frightened when he knew he was lost. What had been a near disaster might have turned out as only a pleasant walk, had he made a few preparations before he stepped from the highway or off a known path.\nWhatever sense of direction that a man may have, it's still largely a question of observation. A skilled woodsman always keeps an eye on his surroundings. He notes that the shape of a mountain, the direction water flows through a swamp, and the way a tree leans across a path. With these in mind, he may be turned around many times, but he is seldom lost.\nThere are exceptions, of course, and once in a while a man does come across some strange problem that puts him into the \"lost\" situation. A rainstorm or sudden blizzard may catch him without a compass   in his pocket. Darkness may find him in a rough area, where travel is dangerous without a light.\nWhen this happens, the normal first reaction   is the fear of being laughed at as a result of his poor knowledge in the woods. He may also be concerned about the inconvenience that he will cause his friends when he doesn't show up. This false pride may lead him to keep on the move in a false effort to find his way against all difficulties.\nThe person who thinks ahead is seldom in great danger.

My mother and I used to talk on the phone a few times a day. I saw her at least twice a week. Now she doesn't answer when I call, and never calls me back. She doesn't see me and then complains that I don't see her enough.\nIt all started a few months ago, I started having a date with a man, and we became serious quickly. This is not the first boyfriend I have had. I know she isn't mad at me for my finding love. The turn-in events happened when I moved from about 15 minutes away from my mom to 1.5 hours away from her. She encouraged it, she seemed happy, and she helped me pack. Since then, everything has changed.\nI can't tell if she cares about me and I don't know if she is bitter. When I call her, she says she is busy and will call me back. Then the problem is that she never calls me back, I make plans with her, but she cancels. Then when I do see her, she gives me comments like \"It's been a while since you came to see me\". It seems like I haven't tried. It's very frustrating.\nI don't know what is wrong, and she won't talk to me, so I can't find out. Does anyone have any advice for what to do in a situation like this? Part of me wants to cry and stop trying. But not talking to her tears me apart. Please give me some advice below.",

        "Article: Three surfers rushed to save a man's life after he was left drifting on a notorious stretch of water.\nThe men stayed with Greg Popple for 30 minutes and had to be rescued themselves by helicopter as the drama unfolded. \nThe 45-year-old had floated out on a body board near Hutchwns Point at 8:30 am. He found himself in trouble about half-a-mile from the shore and dangerously close to rocks. Surfers Graig Evans, 31, Robert Miles, 19, and Owain Daviees, 23, were risking their own safety to keep him floating for 30 minutes. Luckily a passer-by noticed what was going on and raised the alarm. Porthcawl Coastguard, Porthcaw Lifeboat and an RAF helicopter all took part in the rescue. \n\"The man who got into trouble was a body boarder-there was a big tide where he was,\" said Joe Missen. \"Three other surfers spotted he was in difficulty and he was going down. They kept him afloat because he was in a state of shock and out of energy. If Mr. Popple was closer to the rocks, it could have been a lot worse, but they managed to keep him from harm\".\nMr. Missen's mum Alison, also part of the rescue team, said, \"That part of the water is notorious for taking people out to nowhere\".\nThe three men had clocked off a night shift at Ford Motor Company shortly before the incident. \n\"I headed straight down to the beach for a surf, when I saw him flailing . We just swam straight out to him and kept him calm while the help came\".\nThe four men were taken to the life boat house to recover, without injuries.\nQuestion: According to the text, what was the most important thing to do for the three men?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Keeping him farther away from the rocks.\"?",

Researchers in California say they have found that even just a short visit with a dog helped ease the worries of heart patients.\nThe study divided the patients into three groups. In Group A, a dog and a person visited each patient for twelve minutes. Patients in Group B received just a human visitor for twelve minutes. And members of Group C received no visitor, human or canine .\nThe dogs would lie on the hospital bed so the heart patients could touch them. The researchers say some patients immediately smiled and talked to the dog and the human visitor. Dogs, in her words, \"make people happier, calmer and feel more loved.\"\nThe researchers examined the patients before, during and after the visits. They measured stress levels based on blood flow and heart activity. They say they found a twenty-four percent decrease in the group visited by both a dog and a person. They reported a ten percent decrease in the group visited by a person only. There was no change in the patients without any visit. These patients, however, did have an increase in their production of the hormone epinephrine (epinephrine). The body produces epinephrine during times of stress.\nThe increase was an average of seven percent. But the study found that patients who spent time with a dog had a seventeen percent drop in their levels of epinephrine. Patients visited by a human but not a dog also had a decrease, but only two percent.\nQuestion: From the research findings we may conclude that   _  .\nOptions: A: the less the body produces epinephrine, the better\nB: the longer a visit lasts, the happier the patient should be\nC: the patients enjoyed the dogs' company more than the human visitors'\nD: it's impossible for heart patients to recover without dogs' visits",

The company is the largest US-based online seller of products by mail and other services. Now, the company has received a patent for its planned drone delivery system.\nIn March, federal officials allowed Amazon to test its drone delivery plan. But even with a patent and the ability of drones to make deliveries, it does not appear the company will put its new delivery system in place any time soon.\nThe US Patent Office published the document, which describes Amazon's plans to use GPS to deliver products to homes and to wherever people are. The drone will use a customer's mobile device --- usually a smartphone ---to avoid hitting people or buildings and to find a _ area to land. The company wants to deliver products within 30 minutes after people order them on its website.[:++Z+X+X+K]\nHowever, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is worried about the safety. Although it allowed Amazon to test the system, the agency said the operators must be able to see the planes. That greatly limits the delivery area.\nLoretta Alkalay is a professor at the Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology in New York. Although Amazon is not yet offering drone delivery, Professor Alkalay says it will not be long before it does. She says there are worries that the drones will hit buildings or people, or that the products and drones will be stolen or damaged by people on purpose. But she says that is because many people believe the drones would only deliver the products to the front door of a house. \"However, it is possible that homes will one day have special area on their roofs designed to receive product deliveries,\" she adds.\nQuestion: After reading the passage, we can infer that FAA  _\nAnswer:",

The sale of any cup or bottle of sweetened drink larger than 16 ounces would be forbidden under the first-in-the- nation plan.\nThe measure would not apply to diet sodas, fruit juices, zero-calorie Vitamin Waters, dairy-based drinks like milkshakes , or alcoholic drinks; it would not expand to drinks sold in grocery stores or convenience stores.\nStefan Friedman, spokesman for the New York City Beverage Association, criticized the city's plan, saying it turns focus away from the hard work that needs to be done on this front.\nKelly Brownell, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, said he believes the ban would be effective. \"It is not right to put all the blame for obesity on sugar drinks, but they are strongly connected with this rise in obesity over the last 30 years.\" Dr. Farley, the health commissioner, said the city had seen higher obesity rates in neighborhoods where soda consumption was more common.\nCity officials said they believe it will finally prove popular and push governments around the U.S. to follow similar rules.\nMr. Bloomberg has introduced a series of rules in his term of office, including bans on smoking in restaurants and parks, a ban on trans fat  in restaurant food and a requirement for health inspection grades to be posted in restaurant windows.\nBecause of the measures, the mayor was laughed at as Nanny Bloomberg, by those who view the bans as threats  to personal freedom.

And the work for US president-elect Barack Obama has begun.\n   The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest post because of his stand against the war in Iraq and his plans to fix a weak economy. But what will the first 47-year-old African-American president do for race relations? \n   Obama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes and musicians for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe doesn't have to be everybody's role model anymore.\"\n   Recent polls also suggest that Obama's victory has given Americans new optimism about race relations. For example, a USA Today poll found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will finally be worked out\". This is the most hopeful response since the question was first asked during the civil rights revolution in 1963.  \n \n   However, it's still too early to tell whether Obama's presidency will begin to solve many of the social problems facing low-income black communities.\n   Although blacks make up only 13 percent of the US population, 55 percent of all prisoners are African-American. Such numbers can be blamed on any number of factors on America's racist past, a failure of government policy and the collapse of the family unit in black communities.\n   It is unlikely that Obama will be able to reverse   such trends overnight. However, Bill Bank, an expert of African-American Studies, says that eventually young blacks need to find role models in their own communities. \"That's not Martin Luther King, and not Barack Obama,\" he told the Los Angeles Times. \"It's actually the people closest to them. Barack only has so much influence.\"\n   In the opinion of black British politician Trevor Phillips, Obama's rise will contribute more to multiculturalism than to race relations in the US.\n   \"When the G8 meets, the four most important...\nQuestion: What will be the huge psychological shift Trevor mentioned at the end of the passage?\nAnswer:",

They prevent need to carry large amounts of cash and are always useful in emergencies.\nAll the credit card organizations charge interest on a monthly basis which may work out as high as 25 per cent a year, yet sensible purchasing using a card can mean that you obtain up to seven weeks, interest-free credit.Using the card abroad, where items frequently take a long time to be included on your account, can extend this period even further.\nIt is worthwhile shopping around before deciding on a particular credit card.

At a height of almost 310 metres, it is the tallest building in Europe. The Shard has completely changed the appearance of London. However, not everyone thinks that it is a change for the better.\nThe Shard was designed by the famous Italian architect Renzo Piano. When he began designing the Shard for London, Piano wanted a very tall building that looked like a spire  * He wanted the glass surfaces to reflect the sky and the city. The sides of the building aren't regular. So the building has an unusual shape. It looks like a very thin,sharp piece of broken glass. And that is how the building got the name: the Shard. Piano says that the spire shape of the Shard is part of a great London tradition. The shape reminds him of the spires of the churches of London or the tall masts  of the ships that were once on the river Thames.\nThe Shard has 87 floors. At the top, there is an observatory. At the moment the building is empty, but eventually there will be a five-star hotel. There will also be top quality restaurants, apartments and offices.\nBefore building work began, a lot of people didn't want the Shard though the plans were approved. Now they are still unhappy about the Shard. Some critics say that such a tall skyscraper might be good in a city like New York, but not in London. They say that the best thing about the Shard is its spire shape. But that is the only thing. There is no decoration, only flat surfaces. The Egyptians did that 4,500 years ago. They also think the Shard is too big for London. It destroys the beauty of the city.\nOther critics don't like what the Shard seems to represent. They say that the Shard shows how London is becoming more unequal. Only very rich people can afford to buy the expensive private apartments and stay in the hotel. But the people who live near the Shard are among the poorest in London. So the Shard seems a symbol of the division in society between the very rich and the poor.\nThe...",

One of the top choices was investment banking. Lots of people see banking as a way to move up the social ladder and make a lot of money. But it is important to remember that money can't buy happiness. \nJust ask Greg Smith. The former executive director of the top US investment banking firm, Goldman Sachs, resigned his job last week. On the day he quit, he wrote an article in the New York Times describing the \"toxic\" culture of the company for which he had worked for 12 years.\nSmith revealed that over the years, Goldman Sachs often took advantages of its clients. The company tried to make as much money as possible for the firm instead of working for the best deals for their investors.\n\"The firm has turned so far from the place I joined right out of college that I can no long in good conscience say that I identify with what it stands for,\" Smith wrote. \"It makes me ill how coldly people talk about ripping their clients off.\nSmith also criticized the company's promotion policy. People used to be promoted because they showed good character and leadership skills. Now, Smith said, promotion is based on how much money you earn for the company. The way you treat your clients and colleagues does not matter.\n\"Goldman Sachs today has become too much about shortcuts and not enough about achievements. It just doesn't feel right to me anymore.\" Smith wrote.\nThe rewards are great for those who succeed in investment banking. But perhaps it is worth   thinking about how your career will affect your character and how others see you. If Smith is right, success in this career requires a high level of dishonesty.\nThose hoping to make a career in investment banking might want to think twice about the culture of the finance field. A fat bank is all very well, but do all those banknotes add up to happiness?\nQuestion: For those who want to get involved in investment banking, the author intends to   _\n- advise them to think twice before doing so\n- encourage them to be successful\n- warn them to respect the co-workers\n- offer them some shortcuts",

If you lived in the Mediterranean, for instance, you would consider octopus   a great delicacy. You would not be able to understand why some people find it _ . On the other hand, your stomach would turn at the idea of frying potatoes in animal fat --the normally accepted practice in many northern countries. The sad truth is that most of us have been brought up to eat certain foods and we stick to them all our lives.\nNo creature has received more praise and abuse than the common garden snail . Cooked in wine, snails are a great luxury in various parts of the world. There are countless people who, ever since their early years, have learned to associate snails with food. My friend, Robert, lives in a country where snails are not liked. As his flat is in a large town, he has no garden of his own. For years he has been asking me to collect snails from my garden and take them to him.\nThe idea never appealed to me very much, but one day, after heavy shower, I happened to be walking in my garden when I noticed a huge number of snails taking a stroll on some of my prized plants. Acting on a sudden impulse, I collected several dozen, put them in a paperbag,and took them to Robert. Robert was delighted to see me and equally pleased with my little gift. I left the bag in the hall and Robert and I went into the living room where we talked for a couple of hours. 1 had forgotten all about the snails when Robert suddenly said that I must stay to dinner. Snails would, of course, be the main dish. I did not fancy the idea and I reluctantly followed Robert out of the room. To our dismay, we saw that there were snails everywhere: they had escaped from the paper bag and had taken complete possession of the hall! I have never been able to look at a snail since then.\nQuestion: The best title for the passage might be \"  _  \"\nYes or no, is the answer \"One Man's Meat is Another Man's Poison\"?",

Its ideal material is pure , clean water with high clarity  . It should also have the minimum(=least) number of air bubbles. Perfectly clear ice blocks weighing 140 kg and measuring 100 cmx50 cmx25 cm are available from the Clinebell Company in Colorado . Much larger clear blocks are produced in Europe and Canada or harvested from a frozen river in Sweden . These large ice blocks are used for large ice sculpting events and for building ice hotels.\n    Another difficulty in the process of ice sculpting is time control . The temperature of the environment affects how quickly the piece must be completed to avoid the effects of melting . If the sculpting does not take place in a cold environment , then the sculptor must work quickly to finish his piece . The tools used for sculpting also affect when the task can be finished . Some sculptures can be completed in as little as ten minutes if power tools are used .\nIce sculptors also use sharp chisels   that are specifically designed for cutting ice . The best ice chisels are made in Japan , a country that , along with China , has a long tradition of magnificent ice sculptures . Ice sculptures are used as decorations in some cuisines   , especially in Asia . When holding a dinner party , some large restaurants or hotels will use an ice sculpture to decorate the table . For example , in a wedding banquet it is common to see a pair of ice-sculpted swans   that represent the union of the new couple .\nQuestion: Why is ice sculpting difficult according to the passage ?\n- It is hard to control the size and shape of the ice .\n- The right theme for ice sculpting is not easy to find .\n- The proper tools are only available in some countries .\n- It is not easy to find the right kind of ice and work environment .",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\nArticle: The British royal family is about to be slimmed down. The queen plans to reduce the number of real royals, as was recently announced. However, there seems little sign of the monarchy   disappearing completely.\nUp till the 17th century, the British king or queen was believed to rule by \"divine   right\", which was the idea that God chose the king or queen to rule and that he or she was therefore above the law. However, this idea ended with the English Revolution, in which King Charles I was imprisoned and then killed in 1649.\nSo what role does the British royal family have today?\nWell, the Queen has important formal duties: as Head of State, the Queen represents the UK on visits abroad and invites other world leaders to visit the UK. As Head of the Armed Forces, only the Queen can declare when the UK is at war or when war is over. The Queen also has constitutional duties: She has to sign many government and Commonwealth documents every day.\nIn addition, the royal family spends a great deal of its time traveling up and down the country in support of different charity projects. But the public in Britain do not believe there should be a royal family. Sometimes, the press and media criticize the royal family as well. One criticism is that British people should not have to pay for the royal family through their taxes.\nToday, the royal family works hard to be relevant in the modern world. The queen's speech on TV is less formal every Christmas, and is now available as a podcast  . In 2005, after graduation from university, Prince William spent time teaching English in Uruguay, the sort of work many young British people do at some time in their lives.\nOptions:\nA British people are all in favor of the royal family\nB the British royal family are facing surviving challenges\nC the public are encouraged to oppose the royal family\nD British youths are required to teach English in Uruguay in their lives\nAnswer:\nB the British royal family are facing surviving challenges\nQuestion:",

        "Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: Computer technology has become a major part of people's lives. This technology has its own special words. One example is the word mouse. A computer mouse is not a small animal that lives in buildings and open fields. It is a small device that you move around on a flat surface in front of a computer. The mouse moves the pointer on the computer screen.\nComputer expert Douglas Engelbart developed the idea for the mouse in the early 1960s. The first computer mouse was a carved block of wood with two metal wheels. It was called a mouse because it had a tail at one end. The tail was the wire that connected it to the computer.\nUsing a computer takes some training. People who are experts are sometimes called hakers. A hacker is usually a person who writes software programs in a special computer language. But the word hacker is also used to describe a person who tries to steal information from computer systems.\nAnother well-known computer word is Google. It is the name of a popular \"search engine\" for the Internet. People use the search engine to find information about almost any subject on the Internet. The people who started the company named it Google because in maths, google is an extremely large number. It is the number one followed by 100 zeros.\nWhen you \"Google\" a subject, you can get a large amount of information about it . Some people like to google their friends or themselves to see how many times their names appears on the Internet.\nIf you Google someone, you might find that person's name on a blog. A blog is the shortened name for a Web log. A blog is a personal Web page. It may contain stories, comments, pictures and links to other Web sites. Some people add information to their blogs every day. People who have blogs are called bloggers.\nBlogs are not the same as spam. Spam is unwanted sales messages sent to your electronic mailbox. The name is based on a funny joke many years ago on a British television show, \" Monty Python's Flying Circus\". Some friends are at an eating place that only serves a...\nQuestion: Why is the small device called a mouse?\nAnswer:",

A special analysis carried out by the journal indicates that an astonishing 41% of all amphibians on the planet now face extinction while 26% of mammal species and 13% of birds are similarly threatened.\nMany species are already critically endangered and lose to extinction, including the Sumatran elephant, Amur leopard and mountain gorilla. But also in danger of vanishing for the wild, it now appears, are animals that are currently rated as merely being endangered.\nIn each case, the finger of blame points directly at human activites The continuing spread of agriculture is destroying million of hectares of wild habitats every year, leaving animals without homes, while the introduction of newly-come species, often helped by humans, is also damaging native populations. At the same time, pollution and overfishing are destroying ocean ecosystems.\n\"Habitat destruction, pollution or overfishing either skill off wild creatures and plants or leaves them badly weakened,\" said Derek Tittensor, an ocean ecologist at the World Conservation Monitoring Centre in Cambridge. \"The trouble is that in coming decades, the additional threat of worsening climate change will become more and more common and could then kill off these survivors.\"\nThe problem, according to Nature, is worsened because of the huge gaps in scientists knowledge about the planet's biodiversity. Evaluations of the total number of species of animals and plants alive vary from 2 million to 50 million. In addition, evaluations of current rates of species' disappearances vary from 500 to 36, 000 a year. \"That is the real problem we face,\" added Tittensor. \"The scale of uncertainty is huge.\"\nIn the end, however, the data indicate that the world is heading cruelty towards a mass extinction-which is defined as one involving a loss of 75% of species or more. This could arrive in less...\nQuestion: What does \"This\" in the last sentence refer to   _  ?\nOptions: A: mass extinction\nB: extinction rates\nC: extinction time\nD: 75% of species or more",

Lately, though, the dollar has risen, especially against the Japanese yen and the euro. Some traders think the dollar will continue to rise, but that is not clear.\nThe dollar moved up this week after comments by American officials in support of a strong dollar policy.\nOn Monday, before he left for his last trip as president to Europe, George Bush said: \"A strong dollar is in our nation's interests. It is in the interests of the global economy.\" Also Monday, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on CNBC television that he would consider intervention to keep the dollar from sliding further.\nThe United States has not intervened in currency markets since two thousand. That year the administration of president Bill Clinton bought euros to support the European currency.\nBut on Tuesday, President Bush said in Slovenia that the \"relative value of economies will end up setting the proper valuation of the dollar.\"\nA weaker dollar helps American exporters. But it means Americans have to pay more for imports and for travel to other countries.\nSome experts say dollar weakness is the main reason why oil prices have risen so high. Oil is priced in dollars on the world market.\nBut Treasury Secretary Paulson dismissed any link. He noted that since two thousand two, the dollar has fallen about twenty-four percent. But the price of oil has gone up well over five hundred percent.\nAdding to pressure on the dollar, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet suggested that the E.C.B will raise interest rates next month. European officials are increasingly concerned with inflation. But investors can already get higher rates of return on investments in euros than in dollars.\nHigh prices for oil, food and other products have raised inflation concerns worldwide.

Seasonal differences in what mothers ate during pregnancy, and infections occurring at different times of the year could both have an impact on the health of a new-born baby and could influence its life expectancy in older age. \"A mother giving birth in spring spends the last phase of her pregnancy in winter, when she will eat less vitamins than in summer,\" said Gabriele Doblhammer, one of a team of scientists who carried out the research. \"When she stops breast-feeding and starts giving her baby normal food, it's in the hot weeks of summer when babies are prone  to infections of the digestive system.\" In Austria, adults born in autumn (October-December) lived about seven months longer than those born in spring (April-June), and in Denmark adults with birthdays in autumn outlived those born in spring by about four months. In the southern hemisphere, the picture was similar. Adults born in the Australian autumn--the European spring--lived about four months longer than those born in the Australian spring. The study focused on people born at the beginning of the 20th century, using death certificates and census data. Although nutrition at all times of the year has improved since then, the seasonal pattern persists, Doblhammer said.\nBut on the other hand, according to a study of more 40,000 people, those born in spring and summer report themselves luckier than those born in autumn or winter. Professor Richard Wise-man who led the research explained that the temperature at the time of birth might influence the development of the brain and seasonal factors make a difference as well.\nQuestion: The census data of the following countries is used for research EXCEPT   _  .\n- Germany.\n- Denmark.\n- Australia.\n- Austria.",

        "Article: EVERY so often, a sensational   story hits the media about the kind of role models influencing UK teenagers. Youth culture celebrates too many bad examples, the reports say, and the finger of blame is often pointed at celebrities   who drink or take drugs, or who are seen as sexually casual. Yet according to parents and educationalists the media itself is partly to blame. They argue that television, newspapers and magazines are obsessed   with celebrity lives and over-promote a \"celebrity culture\" in which reality show stars are respected purely because they are on television.\nMeanwhile child psychologists warn of the negative effects of unsuitable role models, claiming that young people are being brainwashed into wanting to become famous overnight. They are taught to value physical appearance over personal achievement and set themselves impossible goals. According to a 2010 Home Office study, too many girls think that they have to look \"sexy\" and \"hot\" like their idols , and when they can't achieve this, they lose self-esteem   or suffer from depression and eating disorders.\nBut perhaps young people today are not as easily influenced as we think. The Girls' Attitudes Survey by Girlguiding UK (2011), for example, showed that young girls aged 11 to 21 questioned the media's description of women. Over half of the respondents disagreed with the statement that \"girls and young women are portrayed fairly in the media\".\nA Scout Association survey, of over a thousand 13- to 18-year-olds, showed that teenagers see their parents and siblings   as far more positive role models than celebrities, and while many youngsters list celebrities like Kate Moss and Katie Price as role models, others list high achievers like David Beckham, Paralympian swimmer Eleanor Simmons, and grandparents who fought in the Second World War.\nQuestion: Which of the following is true according to psychologists,   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"young people should put more importance on achievement rather than appearance\"?",

In science, a noise is a mixture of vibrations without any smooth, regular pattern, for example, the sound of an electric drill or a radio tuning from one station to another.\nNoise can be reduced by soundproofing. You have probably noticed the difference between the sound in a empty room and a furnished one. Some materials are very effective at  _ sounds.

Modern cars contain different materials to reduce the amount of noise coming from the engine and other moving parts, as well as noise produced by the car as it moves through the air.

Then she remembers to buy food for her son to eat at school. She also gets a bottle of wine for drinks with friends and a birthday card for her husband's niece. Then she gets coffee for breakfast, ice cream for dessert and remembers stamps to mail the bills. And don't forget soap for the bathroom.\nAnd that is the difference between the female and male brains simply explained in a grocery store. Generally speaking,men do one thing at a time. Women do many. Doing many things at one time is often called \"multi-tasking\", a very popular word these days.\nNow scientific research supports this theory about male and female brains. A recent study has confirmed what we have known all along--men and women think differently.\nScientist at the university of Pennsylvania studied brain images of 949 people aged from 8 to 22 years old. They found that male brains have more connections on one side of the brain, or hemisphere. In female brain, they found more activity and connections between the right and left sides of the brain. The left side of the brain is known as the side of \"reason\" The right hemisphere is known as the \"creative\" side.\nRegina Verma is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. She co-wrote the report. She says when women are asked to do something difficult they might use different parts of the brain. Men, she adds, generally use just one side of the brain.\nAs a result, men generally deal directly with a problem. There is a strong connection between the \"understanding\" and the \"action\" parts of their brains. Women, however, might include other parts of the brain, like the part connected with reason and the part connected with sensitivity when solving a problem. Women take a less direct path to find a solution.\nDr. Venma warns that the study should not lead anyone...\nQuestion: By describing the scene of shopping, the writer wants to   _   .\nAnswer:",

        "FIVE Americans _ the three Nobel Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology   or Medicine last week. It was the first American sweep of the Nobel science prizes since 1983.\nIt's rare for Americans not to receive any of the science prizes, especially in recent years. In 2004, seven Americans were among the 10 laureates   for the science prizes. Last year, the figure was five out of 10.\nThe huge sums of money invested in scientific research is one factor that has helped many Americans to win awards. Another reason is the vast number of researchers working in the US. American universities also often have a more \"creative university environment\"where people can focus on research for a long period without any pressure, said Anders Liljas, member of the Nobel Committee.\nNew hope for AIDS patients?\nAMERICAN scientists Craig Mello (top) of the University of Massachusetts Medical School and Andrew Fire (above) of Stanford University School of Medicine won the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine last Monday. Their discovery is a process that researchers hope to use to silence disease-causing genes  . It offers new ways for disease treatment.\nScientists now hope to develop a new technique that could be used to treat diseases, such as cancers, AIDS and Parkinson's disease.\nLike father, like son?\nAS the son of a Nobel Prize winning professor, Roger D. Kornberg (left) had a lot to live up to. But, nearly half a century after his father, won his award, Kornberg, 59, a Stanford University professor, won his own last Wednesday: The Nobel Prize in Chemistry. His research into how cells read their genes is very important. It could help lead to the development of new drugs to fight cancer  , heart disease and other illnesses, experts said.\nFirst light of the universe\nTWO Americans won the Nobel Prize in Physics last Tuesday for measuring the oldest light in the heavens. It is considered as \"one of the greatest discoveries of the century\". It convinced   scientists that the Big Bang theory   of the universe's origin is correct....\nThe passage is probably taken from  _  .\nA) a science report\nB) a news report\nC) a history lecture\nD) an advertisement",

In fact, I believe more people recognize the Eiffel Tower than any other famous structure in the whole world. That long, long capital A is easy to remember.\nThe Eiffel Tower is the famous symbol of the city of Paris. It also stands for France just as the Statue of Liberty stands for the United States.\nThe Eiffel Tower was not very well liked at first, even though the design had been chosen out of seven hundred designs. A contest had been held to find a design for a tower to be built in Paris by 1889.That year would be one hundred years after the war known as the French Revolution. The French Revolution marked the time when the French people broke away from the rule of kings. It was a very important thing to all Frenchmen, and they wanted a special tower to be built to mark the 100 years.\nWhen his design was chosen, Eiffel was fifty-four, rich, and well-known for his fine work. He had already designed dams, churches, railroad stations, bridges, harbors and, of course, the framework of the Statue of Liberty. But it was the Eiffel Tower that made him really famous. At first, the French hated the tower. When it was begun in 1887, people called it ugly and useless. They also said that it couldn't be built safely, and that it would fall down. As the tower gets close to her nineties, she is still in great shape. And the French people have changed their minds. Now they are very proud of their Eiffel Tower. They even think she is beautiful!\nQuestion: The French Revolution was important to the French because   _  .\n- it gave France a new queen\n- it got rid of a bad king\n- it ended the rule of kings\n- they built the Eiffel Tower 100 years later",

Just for kids, I had to continue to live and work as small-town doctor at my medical clinic in Hawaii. My kids had gone to live on the mainland, and I was alone. Then they asked me to have a family trip.\nOn our trip, we turned on the TV at the motel and saw the second plane crash into the World Trade Center. Seeing it falling down, I said to my kids: \"I'm going to Afghanistan\". And a few weeks later, international Medical Corps sent me to set up 20 clinics in provinces where people had no health care. In these field clinics surrounded by frightening shoots or deadly bombs, we were eventually serving 27,000 patients a month in a very busy schedule. Tired and nervous, I gradually had a sense of achievement, a sense of purpose, and my depression went away.\nIn the years to follow, I went to Indonesia after the tsunami, Pakistan after the earthquakes, Sudan after the civil warm and Iraq after more and more bombs. Each time after disasters one after another, hundreds of people were killed, wounded and many more had to flee. We once set up movable clinics in an area with 19,000  _ , and it was supposed to hold 13,000 originally. Flu broke out, one of the biggest killers of kids in refugee camps, and it spread like wildfire. Water and food were also serious problems. \"Adventures or not?\" I often asked myself.\nWhen my wife passed away, I thought my life was done. But in reality, it was just getting started. At the end of her life, she went unconscious. I held her head in my hands and told her of all the places we would visit and the exciting adventures we would have. \nI think about the moment many times during my \"adventures\". I didn't know how predictive those words would be.But I know that she is still with me.\nQuestion: Where has the doctor been in the past few years?\n- Some countries where he could set up clinics.\n- Some African countries where flu broke out.\n- The places where the earthquakes happened.\n- The places that the horrible disasters struck.",

        "Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: Statuses are wonderful human inventions that enable us to get along with one another and to determine where we \"fit\" in society. In our everyday lives whenever we meet people, we always try to judge them in terms of their statuses. For example, we must judge whether the person in the library is a reader or a librarian, whether the telephone caller is a friend or a salesman and so on.\nOur statuses often vary with the people we meet, and change through life. Most of us can, at very high speed, assume  the different statuses that various situations require. Much of social communication consists of recognizing and selecting among proper statuses and allowing other people to assume their statuses in relation to us. This means that we fit our actions to those of other people, based on a constant mental process of assessment and understanding. Although some of us find the task more difficult than others, most of us perform _ rather easily.\nA status has been compared to ready-made clothes. Within certain limits the buyer can choose style and material. But an American is not free to choose the clothes of a Chinese peasant or that of a Hindu prince. We must choose from among the clothing presented by our society.\nFurthermore, our choice is limited to a size that will fit, as well as by our wallet. Having made a choice within these limits, we can have certain changes made. But apart from small adjustments, we tend to be limited to what the stores have on their shelves. Statuses too come ready-made, and the range of choice among them is limited.\nQuestion: What can be the best title for this text?\nAnswer:",

        "Article: Every culture has a recognized point when a child becomes an adult, when rules must be followed and tests passed.\nIn China, although teenagers can get their ID cards at 16, many only see themselves as an adult when they are 18. In the US, where everyone drives, the main step to the freedom of adult life is learning to drive. At 16, American teens take their driving test. When they have their license, they drive into the grown-up world.\n\"Nobody wants to ride the cheese bus to school,\" said Eleanor Fulham, 17. She brought the pressure back to memory, especially from kids from wealthier families. \"It's like you're not cool if you don't have a car,\" she said.\nAccording to recent research, 41% of 16 to 19-year-olds in the US own cars, up from 23% in 1985. Although, most of these cars are bought by parents, some teens get part-time jobs to help pay.\nNot all families can afford cars for their children. In cities with subways and limited parking, some teenagers don't want them. But in rich suburban areas without subways, and where bicycles are more for fun than transportation, it is strange for a teenager not to have a car.\nBut police say 16-year-olds have almost three times more accidents than 18 and 19-year-olds. This has made many parents pause before letting their kids drive.\nJulie Sussman, of Virginia, decided that her son Chad, 15, will wait until he is 17 to apply for his learner's permit.\nChad said he has accepted his parents' decision, although it has caused some teasing from his friends. \"They say that I am unlucky,\" he said, \"But I'd rather be alive than driving, and I don't really trust my friends on the road, either.\"\nIn China, as more families get cars, more 18-year-olds learn to drive. Will this become a big step to becoming an adult?\nQuestion: 16-year-old drivers have more accidents possibly because  _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"they are never experienced drivers\"?",

Karaoke is a sort of acoustic equipment which was invented in Japan around the middle of the 1970's. It means \"a band without people\" in Japanese. In fact, it is just a music tape without words. This equipment first appeared in some public houses and snack bars, and mainly for the customers to enjoy themselves. Most of the music in Karaoke was popular music. Therefore, at times, when anyone felt like it, he might sing songs to the accompaniment of the music that came from the equipment. Shortly after its invention, Karaoke was spread to the whole world. It was introduced to China and was welcomed by many people.

Males are much larger than females, measuring 2 to 2.5 meters and weighing 200 to 453 kilograms. Females only measure 1.5 to 2 meters and weigh 50 to 113 kilograms. They can also move fairly well while on land.\nCalifornia sea lions can be found living along the Pacific coast of North America. They prefer to live in waters near rocky and sandy shores. On land, they often gather in large groups as many as 1,000 of them. While at sea, they travel in much smaller groups of around 10 or more. They communicate with one another through a series of sounds.\nTheir diet consists of a wide variety of fish and other sea animals. They are able to hold their breath for up to 10 minutes by slowing down their heart rate, allowing them to hunt for their prey for a longer period of time. They have been known to continuously hunt for up to 30 hours at a time, with their eyesight and hearing playing an important part in finding their food. Being so large, they do not have that many natural predators   that they need to be on the lookout for.\nEleven months after getting pregnant, the female will give birth to one baby on land. If the baby can survive long enough, they can live to be 20 to 25 years old.\nCalifornia sea lions are not listed as an endangered species.

They read Spider-Man comic books to 70 kids from Boys & Girls Clubs in southern California. The stars included Drake Bell (Ultimate Spider-Man), Dylan Riley Snyder (Kickin' It), Olivia Holt (Kickin' It) and Cole Jenson (Crash & Bernstein).\nDrake Bell said that the Marvel reading campaign is aimed at kids who are bored with books, believing comic books are the answer for kids who say they'd rather play video games. \"Comic books really get you into the story,\" he told TFK(Time For Kids). \"They are not just words or pictures on a page.\"\nDylan Riley Snyder knows from his experiences that comic books have the power to inspire kids' imagination. His mom was a teacher and she used comic books to interest students who thought they weren't interested in reading. Dylan attended these classes.

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\nArticle: The term \"to extend an olive branch\" means to make an offer of peace or reconciliation . This term has Biblical origins, coming from the section of the Old Testament that deals with the flood; the sign that the flood is over is an olive branch brought back to the ark  by a dove. Olive branches were also symbols of peace in Ancient Greece and Rome, and they continue to be used in various works of art that are meant to suggest peace.\nSome people have suggested that the olive was a very deliberate and well-considered choice as a metaphor for peace, because olive trees famously take years to mature. War is typically very, hard on the trees because people cannot take the time to nurture them and plant new ones. Therefore, the offer of an olive branch would suggest that someone is tired of war, whether it be an actual war or a falling out between friends.\nIn Ancient Greek and Roman times, people would offer actual olive branches. In Rome, for example, defeated armies traditionally carried olive branches to indicate that they were giving in, and the Greeks used them into weddings and other ceremonies. In the modem era, the branch is usually metaphorical, rather than actual, not least because the plants can be a bit difficult to obtain.\nMany people agree that peace negotiations  at all levels of society are a good idea. Between nations, obviously, it is important to extend an olive branch to ensure mutual safety and to help the world run more smoothly. This act can also be important on a personal level, as resolving conflict and learning to get along with others is viewed as an important life skill in many cultures.\nAt some point m their lives, many people will be advised to extend an olive branch to settle a dispute or resolve an issue. Some people believe that it takes an immense amount of courage to take this action, as it often comes with an admission of wrongdoing and regret.\nOptions:\nA is not important on a personal level\nB is only important between nations.\nC takes a lot of courage.\nD is an important life skill m many cultures.\nAnswer:\nC takes a lot of courage.\nQuestion:",

At the various times when I have helped you a little, you have said to me, \"We can get along very well again,\" but in a very short time I find you in the same difficulty again. Now this can only happen by some fault in your behavior. What that fault is, I think I know. You are not lazy, and still you are an idler . I doubt whether since I saw you, you have done a good whole day's work, in any other day. You do not very much dislike to work, and still you do not work much, merely because it does not seem to you that you could get much for it.\nThis habit of uselessly wasting time is the whole difficulty; it is vastly important to you, and still more so to your children, that you should break this habit. It is more important to them, because they have longer to live, and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it, easier than they can get out after they are in.\nYou are now in need of some ready money; and what I suggest is, that you shall go to work hard, for somebody who will give you money for it.\nLet father and your boys take charge of your things at home-prepare for a crop, and make the crop, and you go to work for the best money wages, or to pay back any debt you owe. And to secure you a fair reward for your labor, I now promise you that for every dollar you will, between this and the first of May, get for your own labor, I will then give you one other dollar. By this, if you hire yourself at ten dollars a month, from me you will get ten more, making twenty dollars a month for your work.\nNow if you will do this, you will soon be out of debt, and what is better, you will have a habit that will keep you from getting in debt again. But if I should now clear you out, next year you will be just as deep in as ever. You say you would almost give your place in Heaven for $ 70 or $80.

        "Advertising can be a service to the customer. This is true when advertisements give reliable information about the goods advertised. Such information is needed if the customer is to make a sensible choice when he buys. It is useful in that it lets him know of the kinds of goods in the shops. Printed advertisements do this job best. Customers can collect them and compare them. They can be taken along to shops and their claims can be checked against the actual goods in the shops.\nhowever, some advertisements are not very useful to the customer. Instead of helping him to satisfy his real needs, they set out to make him want things. They set out to create a need. These advertisements are cleverly done. The people who produce them understand our weaknesses. They set out to make us believe that what they advertise will make us cleverer, prettier and more handsome, if only we use it. Actually, it is our money they are after and we should be on guard.\nSome advertisements mislead customers by using part of the truth to suggest something false, and it is skillfully made to give that idea to the careless reader, listener or viewer.\nAt its best advertising can be useful to the customer. At its worst it can mislead him. Many newspapers check on the goods for which the advertisements made claims. Most newspapers are very careful about the small advertisements, which try to sell goods directly to the readers by post. Many newspapers print information about this on their small advertisement pages. Advertising has become a very big business, and good firms in it do all they can to make sure it is conducted with some attention to truth. This is a help to the customer. But the best way is for customers to be on the lookout.\nIt can be inferred from the passage that advertisements can be useful if they   _  .\nA) how a long list of the goods advertised\nB) give true information about goods\nC) tell customers what to buy\nD) appear on TV and in newspapers at the same time",

Recent research from Germany and Italy shows that heart attacks are more common on Monday mornings and doctors blame the stress of returning to work after the weekend break.\nThe risk of having a heart attack on any given day should be one in seven, but a six-year study helped by researchers at the Free University of Berlin of more than 2,600 Germans showed that the average person had a 20 per cent higher chance of having a heart attack on a Monday than on any other day.\nWorking Germans are particularly not protected against attack, with a 33 per cent higher risk at the beginning of the working week. Non-workers, by comparison, appear to be no more at risk on a Monday than any other day.\nA study of 11,000 Italians proved 8 am on a Monday morning as the most stressful time for the heart, and both studies showed that Sunday is the least stressful day, with fewer heart attacks in both countries.\nThe findings could lead to a better understanding of what is the immediate cause of heart attacks, according to Dr Stefan Willich of the Free University. \"We know a lot about long-term risk factors such as smoking and cholesterol but we don't know what actually causes heart attacks, so we can't give clear advice on how to prevent them,\" he said.\nMonday mornings have a double helping of stress for the working body as it makes a rapid change from sleep to activity, and from the relaxing weekend to the pressures of work.\n\"When people get up, their blood pressure and heart rate go up and there are hormonal changes in their bodies,\" Willich explained. \"All these things can have an unfavourable effect in the blood system and increase the risk of a clot in the arteries which will cause a heart attack.\"\n\"When people return to work after a weekend off, the pace of their life changes. They have a higher workload, more stress, more anger and more physical activity,\" said Willich.\nOptions:\nA is not so serious as people thought\nB is harmful to working people in developed countries.\nC is the first killer in Germany and Italy.\nD is created by researchers in Germany and Italy\nAnswer:\nB is harmful to working people in developed countries.\nQuestion:",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: Today, I'm going to talk about the invention of the camera and photography. The camera is often thought to be a modern invention. But as early as 1727, a German physicist discovered that light darkened silver salt, a chemical compound. Using as a camera, a big box with a small hole to let the light in, he made temporary images on the salt. Silver salt is still the base of film today.\nThen a French scientist made the first permanent picture by using a special piece of metal sensitized(...)with silver salt. A photograph he made in 1826 still exists. The painter Daguerre improved on the process by placing common salt, the kind we eat, on the metal. This was in 1839, the official date of the beginning of photography.\nBut the problem was the printing of the photographs. And it was not until other scientists developed the kind of paper we now use that good printing was possible and photography became truly common. In the 1860s, Mathew Brady was able to take his famous pictures of the American Civil War, thus making portrait poses very popular.\nIn the 20thcentury, George Eastmen of theprefix = st1 /United Statessimplified film-developing film, and Dr. Edwin Land invented the so-called instant camera with self-developing film. If we say that the photography came into existence in 1839, it follows that it has taken more than one hundred years for the camera to reach the present condition of technical refinement .\nQuestion: How was the first permanent picture made?\nOptions: A: By placing common salt on a special piece of metal to catch light.\nB: By using a very small and simple camera.\nC: By using a special piece of metal sensitized with silver salt.\nD: By making images on silver salt.",

He asked: \"What do you think the world will be like in 50 or 100 years, in terms of technology and society and so on?\"\nHe says he asks many of the people he meets this question to see what their thoughts are. His point is that no one really knows. I mean, in 1945, could people have even imagined surfing the net or sending e-mails as we do? No way. And the pace of technological innovation  is incredible  .

For example, the luxury jet market in China is the fastest - growing in the world, even _ that of the United States, with a market share of 25 percent. This trend appears to continue, with 20 to 30 percent growth expected in China, compared with only 2 to 3 percent in the US.

        "Article: The concept of culture has been defined many times, and although no definition has achieved universal acceptance, most of the definitions include three central ideas: that culture is passed on from generation to generation, that a culture represents a ready-made principle for living and for making day-to-day decisions, and, finally, that the components of a culture are accepted by those in the culture as good, and true, and not to be questioned. The eminent anthropologist George Murdock has listed seventy-three items that characterize every known culture, past and present.\nThe list begins with Age-grading and Athletic sports, runs to Weaning and Weather Control, and includes on the way such items as Calendar, Fire making, Property Rights, and Tool making. I would submit that even the most extreme advocate of a culture of poverty viewpoint would readily acknowledge that, with respect to almost all of these items, every American, beyond the first generation immigrant, regardless of race or class, is a member of a common culture. We all share pretty much the same sports. Maybe poor kids don't know how to play polo, and rich kids don't spend time with stickball, but we all know baseball, football, and basketball. Despite some misguided efforts to raise minor dialects to the status of separate  tongues, we all, in fact, share the same language.\nThere may be differences in diction and usage, but it would be ridiculous to say that all Americans don't speak English. We have the calendar, the law, and large numbers of other cultural items in common. It may well be true that on a few of the seventy-three items there are minor variations between classes, but these kinds of things are really slight variations on a common theme.\nThere are other items that show variability, not in relation to class, but in relation to religion and ethnic background -- funeral customs and cooking, for example. But if there is one place in America where the melting pot is a reality, it is on the kitchen stove; in the course of one month,...\nQuestion: The author's main purpose in writing this passage is to   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"show that the idea that the poor or the rich establish a separate culture is an absurdity\"?",

The joke that causes a burst of laughter from one listener might be met with a puzzled look from another.\nIn general, you should avoid jokes at any business or social gathering where there are more than two people in your conversational group. If there are only two people -- and they consist of you and your best friend -- go ahead and tell it.\nAdmittedly, a few people possess a perfect sense of timing, appropriateness, and joke delivery. You are probably not one of them. You might be quite funny and have many great jokes. But there's a place for jokes -- over dinner with family, hiking with friends, but business or social affairs with colleagues and acquaintances   are not it. It takes a whole other level of joke-telling ability to put a joke into the more formal conversations.\nThe best jokes come into the conversation so that by the time listeners realize a joke is in progress, the punchline that produces humour is being delivered -- to their surprise and delight.\nJokes don't translate well when you're in a group with mixed backgrounds: those whose first language is not English, those who might not understand a special term or an \"in\" expression, young people who wouldn't catch a reference to some bit of culture familiar to older people -- and vice versa  .\nNever joke about another person in the group -- about their name, habits, hometown, profession, appearance, or past. It's not a question of whether the joke is cheery or appropriate. No one enjoys being singled out this way.

Online schools receive the same amount of funding as all other public schools, even though they don't have to pay for rent or school equipment. States should use their educational funds to improve education at real schools, not to support online programs.\nSome students only use online classes to supplement their school work. They benefit from the social experience of a traditional high school, while still taking online courses.\nHowever, about 90 thousand students in America receive their education only from online schools. 50 thousand of these students take courses at Florida Virtual School, the largest online school in the country. While this method of schooling helps students who live in remote regions, most school systems are upset that they are losing more students each year to these online programs.\nAlthough online learning allows children to work at their own pace, these online schools have only one teacher per several hundred students. Often, teachers can't give struggling students the help they need as they are unable to talk face-to-face with them, to find exactly what they're having difficulty with.\nAdditionally, even though online schooling accommodates   students who live in more remote states, students in online programs may suffer in social situations because they will not learn valuable communication skills from their schooling. Similar to students who are home schooled, those who take only online classes won't learn social etiquette  , and will be treated differently by their peers.\nOnline schooling might be useful for places where there are not enough students for a real school, such as agricultural regions, but states should only spend taxpayers' money on online schools in extreme cases.\nQuestion: According to the passage, online schooling   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"is helpful to students living in remote regions\"?",

So, have you ever wondered what your preference for cats or dogs says about you?\nIn fact, a 2010 study done by Sam Gosling, a psychologist at the University of Texas, US, and his graduate student Carson Sandy found that dog people are more extroverted  , agreeable and conscientious   than cat people.\n\"Cats will occasionally engage in social activities, but usually after only a few minutes they will give up the game. Dogs, on the other hand, will often engage in play, like fetching a thrown ball, for hours at a time,\" said Modern Dog magazine.\nJust on the basis of dogs' nature being more sociable than cats', you may expect that the personalities of dog people also reflect higher sociability. And Gosling's study found that dog people are generally about 15 percent more extroverted and 13 percent more agreeable, both of which are associated with social orientation  .\nIn addition, dog people are 11 percent more conscientious than cat people. \"Conscientiousness\" is a tendency to show self-discipline, to complete tasks and aim for achievement. This trait also shows a preference for planned rather than spontaneous   behavior.\nIn comparison, cat people are about 12 percent more anxious, but they are also 11 percent more \"open\" than dog people, due to a general appreciation for art, emotion, imagination, curiosity, adventure, unusual ideas and variety of experience. And people high on openness are more likely to hold unconventional beliefs.\nDespite so many differences, there are some things that cat people and dog people have in common. \"Both types of people consider themselves close to nature, dislike animal-print clothing and generally look on the better side of life,\" noted Mother Nature Network.\nOptions:\nA Differences between dogs and cats in their personality traits.\nB Factors that influence people's preference for dogs or cats.\nC How raising a pet helps shape your personality.\nD What your preference for dogs or cats tells about you.\nAnswer:\nD What your preference for dogs or cats tells about you.\nQuestion:",

And people who work an extra three hours a day--or 55 hours a week--are 33 per cent more likely to have a stroke, the scientists found.\nThe research, published in the Lancet medical journal, is based on health records of more than 500, 000 people across Europe, the US and Australia.\nScientists led by University College London warned that people who work longer hours tend to do less exercise, sit at a computer for hours at a time and drink more than people with a better work-life balance. Repeated stress may also be to blame for greater health problems, the scientists think.\nThey looked at the combined result of 17 previous studies, in which 529, 000 people were tracked over an average of seven years.\nExperts stressed that the study had only found a link between hours worked and heart problems---it had not proved what had actually caused each death. But they warned people to take note of the findings.\nDr Tim Chico, consultant cardiologist at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, said \"For many people, reducing their working hours would be difficult or impossible, and this study does not show that it would reduce the risk of stroke.\" Most of us could reduce the amount of time we spend sitting down, increase our physical activity and improve our diet while working and this might be more important the more time we spend at work.",

Immigrants  coming into the United States have contributed many words to the language, which have kept their original pronunciation. \"Coolie\" and \"kowtow\" were taken from the Chinese language, \"kamikaze from the Japanese, \"shampoo\" from India, \"blitz\" from German, \"amigo\" and \"Los Angeles\" from Spanish and so on.\nMany students have studied English for years, some as many as eight. However, some students still have difficulty in speaking fluent English. Some know many words but are unable to _ them when native speakers use them. In our Oral English classes we will focus on speaking and listening to native English speakers. For this reason, because we are trying to train your ears to hear English and your mouths to speak intelligible   English, we will have a rule that ONLY ENGLISH will be spoken in our English classes. Anyone speaking Chinese in class will be required to pay a fine in order to encourage the speaking and understanding of English. If teachers enter a classroom and discover that anyone is speaking Chinese, they will require everyone in the room to pay the fine. It is everyone's job to enforce the English-Only rule. It is for your benefit. It is because we want to accustom   your ears to hearing English.\nOther subjects may be learned solely from books but the only way to learn a foreign language is to SPEAK IT! Students are often nervous about speaking in class at first but we hope to make the classes fun, so you will forget your nervousness and learn to speak out. Enjoy your classes.\nQuestion: In the author's opinion , the only way to learn a language well is to  _  .\n- listen to it on the radio\n- learn it from books\n- play games with it\n- speak it often",

And while researchers can't be sure that playing less is directly to blame, they say that games provide vital intellectual stimulation and exercise. The Bristol University study showed that only one in five owners play with their dogs six times a day.  Half play two or three times a day and 10 per cent have just one play session.\nMark Evans, former chief vet for the RSPCA, said that dogs are one of the few animals to play into adulthood.  He told the Sunday Times: 'There is a clear association in the results.  Owners report more potential behaviour problems in dogs that play less.'\nEmily Blackwell -- who conducted the research uncovered tonight on Channel 4's Dogs: Their Secret Lives - said dogs often enjoy playing so much that they slow down or change strategy to make the fun last longer. The lecturer in canine  welfare hopes that 10,000 people will eventually fill out the survey. This will enable her to firmly establish whether lack of play is affecting dogs' moods - or if their emotional problems put their owners off spending time with them.  For instance,they may slow down when playing 'chase', allowing their owner to catch up with them and the game to continue. Favourite games include wrestling, chase and tugging at toys, and perhaps unsurprisingly,'fetch' topped the list. Tennis balls were the favourite toys, followed by soft, squeaky toys, rubber balls and rope toys.\nThe research comes just days after an animal charity warned that millions of dogs are becoming fat. aggressive and destructive because their owners are clueless about basic animal care.The PDSA said that treats including beer, chips and leftover takeaways are making dogs fat and unwell - and wamed that almost a million are never taken for a walk.\nQuestion: What is Emily Blackwell's opinion on dogs' behavior?\nAnswer:",

But these pets carry plenty of germs and allergens , prompting researchers to ask: Are cats and dogs really safe for children?\nA study finds that, contrary to many parents' fears, owning cats or dogs does not increase a child's risk of developing allergies, and in fact, may actually protect them. The study's lead author, Dr. Dennic Ownby of the Medical College of Georgia, says that even he was \"very surprised\" by the results. Ownby and colleagues followed more than 470 children from birth to age 6 or 7, comparing those exposed to cats and dogs during their first year of life to those who were not.\nBy using skin-prick  tests for detecting common allergies, the researchers found that, contrary to what many doctors had been taught for years, children who had lived with a pet were not at greater risk.\nEven more remarkable, children who had two or more dogs or cats had an even greater reduction, up to 77 percent, in risk of allergies. Researchers suggest this protective effect may be the result of early exposure to lots of bacteria that are carried by dogs and cats. Exposing young children to these bacteria helps\" exercise\" their immune systems early in life so that they're better able to resist allergic diseases later.\nThere's something very important in that first year of life when the immune system is developing that we can retrain _ away from an allergic response, said Dr. William Davis.\nAnd while researchers are not encouraging parents to buy dogs or cats just to reduce a child's allergy risk, they say if a family already has one or more animals, there's no need to get rid of them.\nQuestion: Why do the researchers feel \"very surprised\" by the results of the study?\nAnswer:",

And making that dream come true often means finding a building no one else seems to want, which is exactly what happened to David Yocum and his partner, Brain Bell. Their building is a former automobile electrical--parts firm in Atlanta. From the outside, it looks too old, even something horrible, but open the door and you are in a wide, open courtyard, lined on three sides with rusting   walls.\nIn 2000, Yocum and Bell found this building in the city's West End. Built in 1947, the structure had been abandoned   years earlier and the roof of the main building had fallen down. But the price was right, so Yocum bought it. He spent eight months of his off-hours on demolition  , pulling rubbish out through the roof, because it was too dangerous to go inside the building, The demolition was hard work, but it gave him time to think about what he wanted to do, and \"to treasure what was there--the walls, the rust, the light,\" Yocum said. \"Every season, more paint falls off the walls and more rust develops. It's like an art installation   in there--a slow-motion show.\"\nSince the back building had been constructed without windows, an all-glass front was added to the building to give it a view of the courtyard, and skylights were installed in the roof. The back of the building is a working area and a living room for Yocum and his wife. A sort of buffer   zone between the front and the back contains a bathroom, a kitchen and a mechanical   room, and the walls that separate these zones have openings that allow views through to the front of the studio and the courtyard beyond.\nYocum and Bell, who have just completed an art gallery for the city, feel that the experience from the decoration of their building, focusing on the inside rather than the outside, has influenced their work. It has also given these architects a chance to show how they can make more out of less.",

When I look back on my career, I realize the road to becoming a CEO isn't a straight, clearly clarified path. In fact, no two paths are the same. But whether you want to be a boss one day or not, there's a lot to learn from how leaders rise to the top of successful companies. \n         As this series of stories shows, the paths to becoming a CEO may vary, but the people in that position share the qualities of commitment , work ethic  and a strong desire for building something new. And every CEO take risks along the way--putting your life savings on the line to start a software company or leaving a big business to be one of the first employees at a startup.\n         I grew up in Minnesota, and learned how to be an entrepreneur from my father, who has run a small business for almost 30 years. I went to Georgetown University and tried a lot of business activities in college with varying degrees of success. And I always had a dream job pattern: to walk to work, work for myself and build something for consumers. \n         I'm only 29, so it's been a quick ride to CEO.

The date originated from the Mayan calendar, but actually gained popularity through the hit movie, \"2012\". \nHow will the world end? And how do we know the exact date? There are many theories: A meteoroid from outer space; a solar storm; a shift in the earth's poles; bla bla bla. They all supposedly pointed to the date of December 21st, 2012. Unfortunately, none of it is true. \nZhu Jin, director of Beijing Planetarium, said, \"For earth itself, the end will be billions of years away from now.And for us humans, there is a very small chance that we may be affected by some astronomical factors.However, we don't have the ability to foresee such events so far.So when someone tells you the world is going to end on an exact date, it must be fake.\"\nBut the truth hasn't stopped people from believing. In the sci-fi movie \"2012\", the director imagined the end of the world based on the Mayan calendar. The film earned nearly 770 million US dollars worldwide. Ning Hong, Hebei Province, said. \"The movie 2012 did get one thing right. There are arks  being made in China, But they're not being built secretly inside the mountains.They are constructed here in the courtyard of a factory.\"\nIn April, Liu Qiyuan quit his furniture business and devoted himself to developing these huge round balls. He doesn't believe the end is near, but he wants to be prepared just in case.\nLiu Qiyuan, the \"Ark\" builder, said, \"The concept originated twenty years ago. The Tangshan earthquake had flattened our house, so I wanted to build a shelter that wouldn't fall. Then in 2004, I saw the tsunami in Indonesia that killed so many people.Then I realized it should be something that could withstand the earthquake and float on water.\"\nLiu is hoping to use his invention as a life boat on the sea.He's planning to test his product on the water next year.  \nIt turns out that rumor, though false, is good for business.

Can changes in life-style add years to one's life? Throughout history people have sought answers to these questions and others.\nVarious myths offer the hope of great longevity. In the imaginary land of Shangri-La, for example, people are said to lead a charmed existence for a thousand years. The Spanish explorer Ponce de Leon was convinced that he would find the Foundation of Youth in what is now the state of Florida. According to the Bible, Methuselah lived to be more than 900 years old.\nThe subject of longevity is fascinating, and scientists study individuals such as Jeanne Calment to learn about the aging process. Calment died in 1997 in Arles, France, at the age of 122. She never married, and she lived in her own apartment until moving to a retirement community when she was 109.\nMost scientists agree that bodies will last, at best, about 125 years. This potential has changed little since modern human beings appeared more than 100 thousand years age. Recent improvements in medicine and the environment have extended life expectancy, especially for those from poorer parts of the world. It is not clear, however, whether such improvements will lengthen life expectancy beyond a certain point.\nLife expectancy is the number of years an infant can be expected to live, given the conditions into which it is born. Life expectancy, therefore, is affected by nutrition, medical care, and social and political circumstances. An individual's genetic makeup is also an important factor. Children from long-lived families can hope to enjoy long lives themselves. According to recent data, the average life expectancy worldwide in 1998 was 67 years. This can be compared with an average life expectancy of 77 in the United States.\nIn 1970 the average life expectancy worldwide was 61 years, or 6 years less than it was in 1998. This same period saw a drop in infant mortality --- the death of a child before the first birthday---from 80 births out of 1,000 to 54...",

There were no art directors, no stylists, no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting. In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists.\nMy story begins when I was in New York City for a speech, and my wife took a picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of the 57thand 5thavenue. We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.\nWell you can see where this is going. Approaching my daughter's third birthday, my wife said, \"Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ceremony?\" This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture.\nSo these photos are far more than representatives for a single moment, or even a specific trip. They're also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year, and nor just physically, but in every way.

Last year, I came across an article in a magazine describing living statues in the streets of some Australian cities.

All the harder, then, to believe that I ran into the \"wonder\" in prefix = st1 /Barcelonathis year. The performers - the living statues - were street artists at Las Ramblas.\nLas Ramblas is the most famous street in Barcelona. Especially in summer, thousands of tourists go to the seaside by passing through this street, making it a center of shops and bazaars. Not only can you find tourists there, but also thieves, cheats, cops...among whom the living statue artists are the most special group.\nThey were covered with greasepaint in different color1s, wearing season - disproportional  clothes, standing on a pedestal for several hours without making even a single move. Are they real or _ , the guests were wondering...and then suddenly the statues came to life, just for a few seconds to shift positions. But the movement of the statues seemed like someone just had breathed life into them. They really do look like statues, and that's how they got their name.\nUsually there is a jar or a hat in front of them. They would change to another pose whenever some tourist puts a coin in the hat. You may take photos after giving a Euro, or even less, but be careful not to touch the statues, unless you want yourself to be covered in paint.

I couldn't help overhearing parts of their conversation. At one point the woman asked: \"So, how have you been?\" And the boy--who could not have been more than seven or eight years old--replied, \"Frankly, I've been feeling a little depressed lately.\"\nThis incident stuck in my mind because it confirmed my growing belief that children are changing. As far as I can remember, my friends and I didn't find out we were \"depressed\", that is, in low sprits, until we were in high school.\nUndoubtedly a change in children has increased steadily in recent years. Children don't seem childlike anymore. Children speak more like adults, dress more like adults and behave more like adults than they used to.\nWhether this is good or bad is difficult to say, but it certainly is different. Childhood as it once was no longer exists. Why?\nHuman development is based not only on born biological states, but also on patterns of access to social knowledge. Movement from one social role to another usually involves learning the secrets of the new status. Children have always been taught adult secrets, but slowly and in stages: traditionally, we tell sixth graders things we keep hidden from fifth graders.\nIn the last 30 years, however, a secret-revelation machine has been installed in 98 percent of American homes. It is called television. Television passes information to all viewers alike, whether they are children or adults. Unable to resist the temptation, many children turn their attention from printed texts to the less challenging, more vivid moving pictures.\nCommunication through print, as a matter of fact, allows for a great deal of control over the social information to which children have access. Reading and writing involve a complex code of symbols that must be memorized and practiced. Children must read simple books before they can read complex materials.\nQuestion: According to the author, feeling depressed is  _  .\n- a sure sign of a mental problem in a child\n- a mental state present in all humans, including children\n- something that cannot be avoided in children's mental development\n- something hardly to be expected in a young child",

He blinks twice, and the message on the screen becomes clear: \"R U awake?\"\nBut the late-night text does not annoy Brandon. He gets frequent messages and calls, even after bedtime. And he can't imagine life without them. \"If I didn't have a cell phone, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friends or family as often,\" he told the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nBrandon's use of technology doesn't stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles in his room. With so many devices, it is no surprise that when he is not at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices.   Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by TFK, kids aged 8 to 18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. That's about an hour more than just five years ago.\nThe jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. \"These devices have opened up many more opportunities for young people to use media, whether it's on the bus, on the way to school or waiting in line at the pizza parlor,\" says Rideout.\nOften, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \"If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" Media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \"It's a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\nMultitasking while doing homework is another concern.

        "For history fans, Margaret Thatcher is one of the most interesting of the British Prime Ministers. She is praised by both British and American conservatives for her firm principles and accomplishments of her term.\nBeing so popular, it is only appropriate that a solid movie be made to detail the life of the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. The film Iron Lady focuses on Thatcher (Meryl Streep) and her dementia , with certain items in her house reminding her of periods of her life, which then start series of flashbacks. Thatcher also fantasies of her husband, Denis (Jim Broadbent), and holds conversations with him throughout the film.\nIn a world controlled by men and where women are thought to belong to the kitchen, Thatcher struggles to break through the barriers of sex to win a seat in Parliament . Not only does she struggle with her sex, but being the daughter of a simple shopkeeper, she struggles with class barriers.\nAfter winning a seat in Parliament in 1959, Thatcher was appointed Secretary of State for Education and Science(SES). The film details how the leadership of her party didn't take her or her opinions seriously. Thatcher became tired of being unheard and decided to challenge the leadership of the party and run for Leader of the Opposition. Not expecting to win the position, she took off in popularity, continuing a strong campaign even after her manager was killed by the Irish Republican Army.\nThatcher, after the conservative party won a majority in Parliament, became the first woman Prime Minister of the UK. She took off in popularity until an economic decline hit the country. She regained popularity after the Falklands War.\nThe film, in many cases, shows archive footage to convey the historic timeline of the movie. The film does an excellent job in recording the complex life of one of Britain's most complex women. It examines the price that Lady Thatcher paid for power, the class and sex struggles she overcame, and the burden of dementia.

        "Ever since man began to use the telephone, there have been new problems arising from the carrying of messages. At first, each message was carried by a pair of overhead wires. As a result, telephone exchanges were soon surrounded by thousands of wires. The wires were then replaced by cables  ,each containing many pairs of wires. Each cable is capable of carrying many messages. These cables, laid underground, replaced the overhead wires.\nThe more _ telephone services have become, the more demand for these services has increased, particularly the demand for long-distance services. In China, for example, this growth is now over 30% every year. Long-distance telephone exchanges are usually in crowded cities, where is not easy to lay new labels for expanding services.\nThe use of radio to send telephone message and to link all telephone exchanges makes it possible to get rid of overhead wires and some underground cables.\nNow man has invented the microwave system (  ). In a microwave system messages from various places can be brought together, and then they are sent out and received by radio. After that, the messages are split into their original form. Finally, they are sent to the places where they are going to be sent.\nWhat does the word  _  mean?\nA) growing\nB) using\nC) holding\nD) understanding",

        "London--A morning train rides away, across the channel. English kids discuss the Liverpool's football team in a Paris pub.\nSome Parisians have started to travel to work in London.\nIn the 19th century, Charles Dickens compared the two cities, London and Paris, in A Tale of Two Cities. These days, it might be A tale of One City.\nAs there are few jobs at home over recent years, perhaps 250,000 Frenchmen moved across the channel. With an undersea tunnel, they could travel between cities in three hours. The European Union freed them from immigration and customs.\nParis, rich in beauty, is more stylish. But London feels more full of life, and more fun until the pubs shut down.\n\"For me, the difference is that London is real, alive,\" said Trevor Wheeler, a financial expert.\nChantal Jaouen, a professional designer, agrees. \"I am French, but I'll stay in London,\" she said.\nThere is, of course, the other view. Julie Lenoux is a student who moved to London two years ago. \"I think people laugh more in Paris,\" she said.\n\"Both cities have changed _ ,\" said Larry Collins, an author and sometimes a Londoner. Like most people who know both cities well, he finds the two now fit together comfortably. \"I first fell in love with Paris in the 1950s. Things are so much more ordered, and life is better.\"\nBut certainly not cheaper. In some parts of London, rents can be twice those on Avenue Foch in Paris.\nDeciding between London and Paris requires a lifestyle choice. Like Daphne Benoit, a French journalism student with perfect English, many young people are happy to be close enough so they don't have to choose. \"I love Paris, my little neighborhood, the way I can walk around a centre, but life is too organized,\" she said. \"In London, you can be whoever you want. No one cares.\"\nWhat's the meaning of the last two sentences?\nA) People can do everything in London.\nB) People will feel lonely in London.\nC) People in London enjoy living in different ways.\nD) People in London enjoy a lawless life.",

        "Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: When a consumer finds that something he or she bought is faulty or in some other way does not live up to what the producer says for it, the first step is to present the warranty ,or any other records that might help, at the store of buying. In most cases, this action will produce results. \nHowever, if it does not, there are various means the consumer may use to gain satisfaction.A simple and common method used by many consumers is to complain directly to the store manager. In general, the \"higher up\" the consumer takes his or her complaint, the faster he or she can expect it to be settled. In such a case, it is usually settled in the consumer's favour, taking it as true that he or she has a just right.\n    Consumers should complain in person whenever possible, but if they cannot get to the place of buying, it is acceptable to phone or write the complaint in a letter.\n    Complaining is usually most effective when it is done politely but firmly, and especially when the consumer can show clearly what is wrong with what was bought in question. If this cannot be done, the consumer will succeed best by presenting specific information as to what is wrong, rather than by making general statements. For example,\"The left speaker does not work at all and the sound coming out of the right one is unclear\" is better than \"This stereo  does not work.\".\n    The store manager may advise the consumer to write to the producer, if so, the consumer should do this, stating the complaint as politely and as firmly as possible. But if a polite complaint does not achieve the expected result, the consumer can go a step further. He or she can threaten to take the seller to court or report the seller to a public organization responsible for protecting consumers' rights.\nQuestion: According to the passage, the last way a consumer has to use is   _\nAnswer:",

        "Article: The television news feature about Ben Heckmann, an eighth grader from Farmington, Minn, was breathless in its praise. \"At 14, he has accomplished something many adults can't achieve,\" the reporter said, \"Ben is a twice-published author.\" But Ben's two \"Velvet Black\" books, describing a fictional rock band, were not picked from a pile of manuscripts by an eagle eyed publisher. They were self-published, at the cost of $400 by Ben's parents.\nOver the past five years, print-on-demand technology and a growing number of self publishing companies whose books can be sold online have inspired writers of all ages to avoid the traditional gatekeeping system for determining who could call himself a \"published author.\"\nThe mothers and fathers who foot the bill say they are simply trying to encourage their children, in the same way that other parents buy equipment for a promising baseball player. But others see self-publishing as a lost opportunity to teach children about hardship and perseverance. Mr. Robbins, a critic, thinks it is wonderful to start writing at a young age, but worries self-publishing sends the wrong message. \"There are no prodigies  in literature,\" he said. \"Literature requires experience, in a way that mathematics and music do not.\" Alan Rinzler, a publishing industry veteran, suggested parents hire a professional editor like him to work with their child to tear a manuscript apart and help make a better. Ben's father, Ken, said Ben's ambitions \"weren't to knockHarry Potteroff the list,\" but \"to get that good feeling inside that you've done something.\"\nAjla Dizdarevic, 12, who has self-published two books of poetry, has been on television and in local newspapers. \"Being a published author,\" she said, \"was always a dream of mine.\" Her new dream: three books by age 15.\nQuestion: Which of the following is true of Ben?\nYes or no, is the answer \"He has achieved something unusual for his age.\"?",

Before checking out the golden sand, take a quick tour of the houses of millionaires from the art and film industries.\nPalm Beach\nOnly about an hour from downtown Sydney, Palm Beach offers a long stretch  of clean sand and water. With parking near the center of the beach, that leaves the rest of it as a _ population and peaceful location from which you can surf or body board--but take care; without the huge crowds of other Sydney beaches, Palm Beach doesn't afford quite the safety level to be found elsewhere; volunteer lifesavers are on duty only on weekends and holidays.\nBondi Beach\nFor the big name beach, Bondi Beach has to be your choice. Parking is difficult to find even on slow days, so consider taking public transport to this world-known beach in the eastern Sydney suburbs.

        "Read the following article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Losing weight comes with a lot of health benefits--including making your brain sharper.\nYes, it turns out that overweight may damage cognitive functions   such as memory and attention. There have been few studies of overweight and cognitive functioning, possibly because it is generally believed that it is not a primary risk cause for poor cognitive performance. Losing weight, therefore, may help improve these mental functions, according to a new research led by John Gunstad, assistant professor of psychology at Kent State University.\nGrowing evidence suggests that being fat is linked to cognitive deficits  . So Gunstad and his team guessed that losing weight might improve mental function. For their study, they measured memory and attention in a group of 150 overweight participants, some of whom had some kind of operation for weight loss and some did not. All of the volunteers completed mental skills tests to assess their abilities of memory and attention at the beginning of the study, and again 12 weeks later. To begin with, about 24% of the patients showed damaged learning and 23% showed signs of poor memory when tested. At the end of the study, those who had lost weight after operation improved their scores into the average or above average range for cognitive functions. Scores for the volunteers who didn't lose weight dropped even further.\nThe study helped Gunstad to find out whether losing weight had any effect on mental function. Now that he's seen the positive effect that weight loss can have on memory and attention, he says he will next study those who choose to lose weight by the traditional way--eating healthier and getting more active. He expects that losing weight in this way will have a similarly positive effect on the brain. \"If we can improve the condition with operations, then we can probably produce the same change with behavioral weight loss as well,\" he says.\nQuestion: The result of Gunstad's study shows that   _  .\n- losing weight has little effect on people's memory\n- losing weight can improve people's mental functions\n- overweight people are likely to have psychology problems\n- overweight people's abilities of concentration differ greatly",

Women talked more to their children and to their college classmates.\nThe type of speech was also explored in the research. The researchers discovered that, with strangers, women were generally more talkative when it came to using speech to ensure her connection to the listener, while men's speech focused more on an attempt to influence the listener. With close friends and family, however, there was very little difference between genders in the amount of speech.\nQuestion: Talking with strangers,   _  .\nOptions: A: women are more talkative than with people they know\nB: men are more talkative than with their wives\nC: women prefer to listen more rather than speak more\nD: men speak a lot to have their opinions accepted",

So maybe it is not surprising that another monumental wonder from prehistory has been overlooked for so long - even though it is just a mile away.\nExperts have discovered an 'extraordinary' line of giant stones that dates back more than 4,500 years. The area around Stonehenge is littered with prehistoric sights but the 90 or more stones, lying 3ft underground, have only just been discovered by sophisticated radar equipment towed by radar equipment. \nThe buried monoliths are each up to 15ft tall. Instead of being arranged in a circle as they are at Stonehenge, it is thought they once formed a long standing line. \n'We are looking at one of the largest stone monuments in Europe and it has been under our noses for something like 4,000 years,' said Professor Vince Gaffney, from the University of Bradford, one of the archaeologists leading the research. 'It's truly remarkable. We don't think there's anything quite like this anywhere else in the world. This is completely new and the scale is extraordinary.\"\nProf. Gaffney believes the stones may have been planted by the same people who built Stonehenge, but he doubts whether there is a direct link between the two monuments.\nThese stones were placed along a steep slope, cut into a natural dry valley to form a C-shaped feature.\nPrecisely why the stones were put there remains a mystery. The archaeologists believe that at some stage the stones were pushed over. This was not done to damage the monument but rather to preserve whatever it was about the stones that seemed so important. \"There was a transformation in the landscape that we do not understand,\" Prof. Gaffney said. \"The stones had significance. These were special places. Societies were organized, as with the great cathedrals, to create these things.\"\nQuestion: Which sentence is TRUE according to the passage?\nOptions: A: Such stone monument is common all around the world.\nB: The stones might serve for a certain purpose.\nC: The stones were inserted into a plain.\nD: The stones pushed over were to reduce the height of the monument.",

In most years, more than five hundred million cases of illness result from the disease, although exact numbers are difficult to assess because many people don't (or can't) seek care. It is not unusual for a family earning less than two hundred dollars a year to spend a quarter of its income on malaria treatment, and what they often get no longer works. In countries like Tanzania, Mozambique, and the Gambia, no family, village, hospital, or workplace can remain unaffected for long.\nMalaria starts suddenly, with violent chills, which are soon followed by an intense fever and, often, headaches. As the parasites multiply, they take over the entire body. Malaria parasites live by eating the red blood cells they infect. They can also attach themselves to blood vessels in the brain. If it doesn't kill you, malaria can happen again and again for years. The disease passed on to humans by female mosquitoes infected with one of four species of parasite. Together, the mosquito and the parasite are the most deadly couple in the history of the earth--and one of the most successful. Malaria has five thousand genes, and its ability to change rapidly to defend itself and resist new drugs has made it nearly impossible to control. Studies show that mosquitoes are passing on the virus more frequently, and there are more outbreaks in cities with large populations. Some of the disease's spread is due to global warming.\nFor decades, the first-choice treatment for malaria parasites in Africa has been chloroquine, a chemical which is very cheap and easy to make. Unfortunately, in most parts of the world, malaria parasites have become resistant to it. Successful alternatives that help prevent resistance are already available, but they have been in short supply and are very expensive. If these drugs should fail, nobody knows what would come next.",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: Sensing phantom phone vibrations  is a strangely common experience. Around 80% of us have imagined a phone vibrating in our pockets when it's actually completely still. Almost 30% of us have also heard non-existent ringing. Are these signs of madness caused by digital culture? Not at all. In fact, phantom vibrations and ringing indicate a fundamental principle in psychology.\nPsychologists use a concept called Signal Detection Theory to guide their thinking about the problem of perceptual  judgments. Working through the example of phone vibrations, we can see how this theory explains why they are a common and unavoidable part of healthy mental function.\nWhen your phone is in your pocket, the world is in one of two possible states: the phone is either ringing or not. You also have two possible states of mind: the judgment that the phone is ringing, or the judgment that it isn't. Obviously you'd like to match these states in the correct way. True vibrations should go with \"it's ringing\", and no vibrations should go with \"it's not ringing\". Signal detection theory calls these faithful matches a \"hit\" and a \"correct rejection\"\nBut there are two other possible combinations: you could mismatch true vibrations with \"it's not ringing\" (a \"miss\"); or mismatch the absence of vibrations with \"it's ringing\" (a \"false alarm\"). This second kind of mismatch is what's going on when you imagine a phantom phone vibration.\nWhat does that mean in terms of your phone? We can assume that people like to notice when their phone is ringing, and that most people hate missing a call. This means their perceptual systems have adjusted their bias  to a level that makes misses unlikely. The unavoidable cost is a raised likelihood of false alarms of phantom phone vibrations.\nThe trade-off between false alarms and misses also explains why we all have to put up with fire alarms going off when there isn't a fire. It isn't that the alarms are badly designed, but rather that they are very sensible to smoke and heat and biased to avoid missing a...\nQuestion: When we judge correctly that \"it's not ringing\", this is called a \"_\".\nOptions: A: hit\nB: miss\nC: false alarm\nD: correct rejection",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: Mosquitoes  ruin countless American picnics every year, but around the world, this bloodsucking beast isn't just annoying--it causes a health problem. More than a million people die from the spread of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and yellow fever each year. Attempts to control populations via insecticides like DDT have had ruinous side effects for nature and human health. Neurobiologist Leslie B. Vosshall has a different solution for stopping the insects and the spread of disease. \"I believe the key to controlling mosquito behavior is to understand better how they sense us,\" she says.\nAt their Rockefeller University lab, Vosshall and her colleagues are studying the chemical sensory processes by which mosquitoes choose hosts. How do they sense heat, humidity, carbon dioxide, and body odor ? What makes some people more attractive to a mosquito than others? It takes blood and sweat to find out. To study how mosquitoes assess body odor, Vosshall and her teammates might wear stockings on their arms and keep from showering for 24 hours to create sample smells, _ They insert their arms into the insects' hidden home to study how mosquitoes land, bite, and feed and then they document how this changes. This can mean getting anywhere from one bite to 400, depending on the experiment. Studying male mosquitoes is more pleasant. Since they don't feed on blood, the lab tests their sense of smell using honey.\nVosshall and her team have also begun to study how genetics contribute to mosquitoes' choice of a host. She's even created a breed that is unable to sense carbon dioxide, an important trigger for the insects. \"By using genetics to make mutant  mosquitoes, we can document exactly how and why mosquitoes hunt humans,\" Vosshall says.\nOnce Vosshall figures out what makes mosquitoes flock to us, she can get to work on making them leave us alone. Many of her lab's proposed solutions sound simple enough, including bracelets  that carry long-lasting repellants  or traps that can reduce populations, but the breakthroughs,...\nQuestion: Vosshall and her colleagues are mainly studying mosquitoes'   _  .\nOptions: A: appearance\nB: size\nC: behavior\nD: change",

His father made him play when he was a child. He got bored, and became a rebel . The strict training that his father pushed upon him got in the way of his wild lifestyle.

Seeing an injured seal wrapped in a blanket at a marine  mammal center gave Haley Humes and Hayley Jeffries an idea for a special Girl Scout project. They decided to make blankets to keep injured animals warm. They would give these blankets to the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach, California.\n\"We knew we wanted to help animals,\" Haley said. \"We went to the center to ask questions about what they needed. They don't have a heated floor, and all the babies crowded together to stay warm.\"\nFriends since kindergarten, Haley and Hayley made 12 blankets to keep the Marine Mammal Center's seals and sea lions warm. Using fun images like Winnie-the-Pooh, the girls took two hours to make each blanket. The first sea lion to test out a blanket looked pretty in pink.\n\"It was a sick baby and really liked it,\" Haley said. \"It curled up in it right away.\"\n\"The blankets are beautiful and the animals love them!\" said the Mammal Center's Michele Hunter. \"It's nice to see children taking pride in their work and doing something to help animals.\"\nDuring the project, the girls took dozens of pictures for the PowerPoint presentations they gave to Girl Scout leaders. Those presentations helped Haley and Hayley raise $250 to buy additional supplies the center needed.\nThis was the first project the girls ever worked on and took months to plan and carry out.\n\"I learned that in order to make something happen, you have to take it slowly and step by step,\" Hayley said. Just as important, the girls discovered that two people really can make a difference. \"Knowing you're making a difference......with these animals is amazing,\" Haley said. \"It was like the animals became my new friends.\"\nThe Pacific Marine Mammal Center cares for sea lions and seals, as well as for other marine mammals. Since opening in 1971,the center has saved more than 5,000 injured marine mammals.\nQuestion: Which of the following words can best describe the work of Haley and Hayley?\nOptions: A: Difficult.\nB: Successful.\nC: Experimental.\nD: Dangerous.",

They were digging at a building site in San Timoteo Canyon   when they unearthed hundreds of ancient animal fossils. Researchers say the bones hold important clues about the history of the region.\nNearly 1, 500 fossils were recovered from the dusty canyon. The remains are about 1.4 million years old. They include the bones of a new species of deer, several small rodents   and more. A giant cat fossil was also found. Scientists believe the animal was an ancestor of the saber- toothed tiger. Signs of plant life were uncovered as well.\n\"This is a huge find,\" says Rick Greenwood, a scientist studying the site. \"I don't think most people had any idea that those types of animals were wandering around here more than a million years ago.\"\nSan Timoteo Canyon is located about 85 miles from Los Angeles. The area of the canyon where the fossils were found was once part of a green river valley. Today, the region is dry and plant life is rare.\nMost of the fossils are well preserved. Experts say a muddy lake bed may have trapped thirty animals that wandered over for a drink. The mud helped to protect the animal fossils.\nThe remains are a million years older than those discovered at the famous La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles. Scientists studying the bones will be able to learn more about how the animals adapted to changes in the environment.\n\"We have a confused view of what this time period was like, \" says another scientist. \"A discovery like this could really be an important contribution.\"\nAbout 35 different animal species are represented in the fossil collection. Scientists began removing bones from the site last fall. The project was completed this summer. Starting next year, the fossils will be on display at the Western Science Center in the nearby city of Hemet, California.\nQuestion: From what Rick says, we know    _   .\nOptions: A: fossils were discovered in the canyon for the first time.\nB: the canyon in ancient times was quite different.\nC: more research work will be carried on in the canyon.\nD: the river water helped to protect the animal fossils.",

It may sound impossible, but it's actually happened.\nThe phenomenon of being able to suddenly speak another language is known as\"Xenoglossia\", from the Greek words\"xenos\"(foreigner)and \"glossa\"(language).\n _ once happened to a 13yearold girl from Croatia. After being unconscious because of a disease for 24 hours in 2010,she woke up speaking fluent German. The girl, who came from the town of Knin in the south of Croatia,was studying German at school but she'd only started recently. Her parents said that she'd been reading German books and watching German TV at home, but that she wasn't fluent in the language.However ,since waking up, she's been able to communicate \"perfectly\"in German.What's really strange is that she's now unable to speak Croat,her mother language.Doctors at Split's KB Hospital have asked some experts to examine the girl as they try to find out what caused the change.Dr Mijo Milas said,\"In earlier times this would have been considered as a miracle ;we prefer to think that there must be an explanation--it's just that we haven't found it yet.\"\nIn 2007,Matej Kus from Czech became unconscious after a motorbike accident. On waking up 45 minutes later,he could speak fluent English.Matej was only 18 years old at the time, and had just started studying the language and so was at a low level.Peter Waite,Kus's teammate said,\"I couldn't believe what I was hearing.It was really clear English.It was unbelievable to hear him talk in unbroken English.\"Unluckily,Matej's new language skills didn't last.Two days later, when he recovered fully from the accident, he'd completely forgotten his English.\nWe still don't know exactly what happened to the two people. Perhaps scientists will discover something new and exciting. But until then, keep studying!\nQuestion: According to the passage,what is\"Xenoglossia\"?\n- That someone becomes unconscious.\n- That someone speaks a new language in a sudden.\n- That someone doesn't like his mother language.\n- That someone is able to speak Greek suddenly.",

The study found that people who watches an average six hours of TV a day lived an average 4.8 years less than those who didn't watch any television .Also ,every hour of TV that participants watched after age 25 was associated with a 22-minute reduction in their life expectancy .\nIt's no mystery that sitting in front of the TV isn't exactly healthy. The more TV you watch, the less physically active you are. And the less exercise you get, the more likely you are to develop disease such as diabetes or hear problems.\n  Lennert Veerman is the lead author of the study ,which was published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine .Working at the University of Queesland, Veerman acknowledges that it may not just be the sedentary  nature of watching TV that lowers life expectancy,but also the poor diet that onscreen junk-food advertising can promote. But Veerman says that association between watching too much TV and lower life expectancy exists, even after adjusting for diet.\n  Veerman says that it might make sense for doctors to start asking their patients about how much time they spend in front of the TV, and to treat TV time as they would be other risk factors for poor health, such as lack of exercise and an unhealthy diet.\n      Veerman points out that people who are concerned can simply turn off the TV and get off the couch. \"Exercise is good,\" he says, \"but even light physical activity also improves health.\"",

        "Below are some tips for women traveling alone. \nExercise hotel safety\nThere are many ways you can make a solo stay at a hotel safer. At cheek-in, you might consider asking for a room near the elevator so you won't need to walk down long, potentially ill-lit hallways to reach your room. When filling out guest registration forms, consider using your first initial instead of your name, and skip the\" Mrs/Miss/Mr\" check box. Additionally, make sure the clerk writes down your room number instead of saying it out loud. This will prevent anyone nearby from knowing where to find you later.\nArrive during the day\nArrive in new cities during the day. Areas around bus and train stations can be scary and/ojr deserted, and small towns tend to shut down early. Veteran solo traveler Mara Rothman of San Francisco notes that plenty of beautiful towns can appear mysterious at night, and locals who are genuinely trying to help you can appear unnecessarily threatening. Arriving during the day means you'll be able to find a place to stay and get to know where you are before dark.\nKeep your documents safe \nIf you choose to wear a money belt, use it for storage and not as a purse. Constantly reaching under your shirt for money draws attention to it, and tends to defeat the purpose. Instead,keep your passport, extra stores of money, and other important documents well hidden, and use a bag or purse for carrying daily spending money.\nDress appropriately\nTo avoid attracting unwanted attention, dress as conservatively as the women you see around you. This doesn't necessarily mean wearing the traditional dress, as that can sometimes have the opposite result. A good rule of thumb is to dress modestly. Think knee-length or longer skirts. Bare arms, shoulders, and legs are considered risked in some countries, so do the research before you go and once you're there. Note which body parts the local women cover and do the same. \nKnow when to make friends \nTraveling alone doesn't always mean being alone.

Ann Jarvis from Grafton, West Virginia, had started the idea to have a day to honor mothers. She was the one who chose the second Sunday in May and also began the custom of wearing a carnation.\nIn 1909, Mrs. Dodd from Spokane, Washington, thought of the idea of a day to honor fathers. She wanted to honor her own father, William Smart. After her mother died, he had the responsibility of raising a family of five sons and a daughter. In 1910, the first Father's Day was observed in Spokane. Senator Margaret Chase Smith helped to establish Father's Day as a national commemorative day, in 1972.\nThese days are set aside to show love and respect for parents. They raise their children and educate them to be responsible citizens. They give love and care.\nThese two special days are celebrated in many different ways. On Mother's Day people wear carnations. A red one symbolizes a living mother. A white one shows that the mother is dead.Many people attend religious services to honor parents. It is also a day when people whose parents are dead visit the cemetery. On these days families get together at home, as well as in restaurants. They often have outdoor barbecues for Father's Day. These are days of fun and good feelings and memories.\nFrom the passage, we know in the U.S   _  .\nA) one should wear a red carnation if one's mother pass away\nB) on Mother's Day, families often go out to have barbecues\nC) on Father's Day, people often stay at home to celebrate the special day.\nD) The purpose to have these two special days is to show love to parents",

Despite its bad name, and the fact that the species was alive during recorded human history, little is actually known about how this animal lived, looked, and behaved. A new study of the only known complete skeleton  from a single bird takes advantage of modern 3-D laser scanning  technology to open a new window into the life of this famous extinct bird.\nThe study was presented at the 74th Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in Estrel, Berlin. Leon Claessens, Associate Professor at the College of the Holy Cross, and lead researcher on the study said that, \"the 3-D laser surface scans we made of the fragile dodo skeletons enable us to reconstruct how the dodo walked, moved and lived to a level of detail that has never been possible before.

Bachmann, was the most influential teacher I ever had.\nI had gotten into trouble in his class: Another student had pushed me for fun, and I became angry and began to hit him. Mr. Bachmann stopped the fight, but instead of sending me to the office, he sat me down and asked a simple question: \"Penna, why are you wasting your life? Why aren't you going to college?\"\nI didn't know anything about colleges or scholarships. No one had ever considered that a fatherless boy from the poorest neighborhood had a future. That day, instead of rushing off for lunch, he stayed and explained possible education options to me. At the end of our talk, he sent me to see a secretary who had a child at a state college. This was in 1962 at Emerson High School in Union City, New Jersey.\nWell, 53 years have passed, and what have I done with the knowledge he gave me? I gained a PhD from Fordham University when I was only 29. I taught English and social studies and then moved up the chain of command from teacher to principal.\nI've sat on the board for Magnet Schools of America and represented that organization at the United Nations. I've won a number of great educational awards. But where would I be if a truly caring teacher had not taken the time out of his lunch period to speak to me? It was without question only his confidence in me that helped me forward.\nI have repaid his kindness hundreds of times by encouraging misguided youngsters to aim higher. If I have saved any children, it is because of him. If I have been a successful educator, it is because I had a great role model in Mr. Bachmann.\nQuestion: How did Mr. Bachmann influence the writer?\n- He set the writer on the right path.\n- He tried to set a good example to the writer.\n- He was strict with the writer.\n- He helped the writer with his study.",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article:\nArticle: Bananas are one of the world' s most important food crops. They are also one of the most valuable exports. Bananas do not grow from seeds. Instead, they grow from existing plants. Bananas are threatened by disease because all the plants on a farm are copies of each other. They all share the same genetic weaknesses. For example, the Cavendish banana is most popular in North American and European markets. However,some kinds of fungus organisms easily infect the Cavendish. Black Sigatoka disease affects the leaves of Cavendish banana plants. The disease is controlled on large farms by putting chemicals on the plant' s leaves. Farmers put anti-fungal chemicals on their crops up to once a week.\nAnother fungal disease is more serious. Panama disease attacks the roots of the banana plant. There is no chemical treatment for this disease. Infected plants must be destroyed. Panama disease has affected crops in Southeast Asia, Australia and South Africa. There is concern that it may spread to bananas grown in the Americas. This could threaten an important export product for Central and South America.\nThe International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain supports research on bananas. The group has headquarters in France and other offices in the major banana-growing areas of the world. The group says that more research must be done to develop improved kinds of bananas. The group says that fungal diseases mainly affect only one kind of banana. In fact, there are five hundred different kinds of bananas. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has said that the Cavendish banana represents only 10% of world production.\nThe U.N. agency says farmers should grow different kinds of bananas. This protects against diseases that affect only one kind. Experts warn that disease may cause the Cavendish banana to disappear. This happened earlier to another popular banana because of its genetic weakness against disease.",

        "Read the following article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Have you ever made contact with the creative spirit, that certain something hard to describe, but full of good--and sometimes great--ideas? It is more than an occasional great thought. When we feel the moving of the creative spirit, it brings to life a style of being: a lifetime filled with the desire to invent, to explore new ways of doing things, and to turn dreams into reality.\nThat flash of inspiration is the final moment of a process marked by unique stages--the basic steps in creative problem-solving. The first stage is preparation, when you look for any information that might be important. It's when you let your imagination run free.\nBut one barrier  is the inside voice of judgment that locks up our creative spirit within the limits of what we think acceptable. It's the voice that whispers to you, \"They'll think I'm foolish,\" or \"That will never work.\" But we can learn to recognize this voice of judgment and have the courage to discount its unhelpful advice.\nOnce you have thought about all the relevant  pieces and pushed your mind to the limits, you can let the problem remain and take in all you have gathered. It's a stage when much of what goes on occurs outside your focused awareness. As the saying goes, \"You sleep on it.\"\nWe are more open to creative thoughts from the unknowing mind when we are not really thinking of anything. That is why daydreams are so useful in the search for creativity. Anytime you can just daydream and relax is useful in the creative process: a shower, long drives, a quiet walk, etc.\nWith luck, daydreaming will lead to a light turning on above your head, when all of a sudden the answer will come to you as if from nowhere. This is the popular stage--the one that usually gets all the glory and attention, the moment that people sweat and long for, the feeling \"This is it!\" But the thought alone is still not a creative act. The final stage is translation, when you take your creative thought and transform it into action; it becomes useful to you and others.\nQuestion: According to the article, what keeps us from creativity?\n- Having less information to form a good idea.\n- Relying on others during the creative process.\n- Caring about other people's opinions about us.\n- Thinking about too many ideas at the same time.",

My parents spent a lot of money on a private school, so they could get me into a competitive middle school. Everything was about tomorrow, next year, my graduation. We never had to worry about today.\nBefore last summer I never thought much about the people in the world who live day to day, every day, whose lives are controlled by poverty and hunger. Then I enrolled in a two-week intensive program. We lived in a \"Tribal Village,\" in a hot, dry open grassland in Arkansas, a state of the south-central United States. I am a tribal member in Mozambique, a country of southeast Africa. Every meal, I make the fire for my family, and feel the flames lick up my nostrils as I blow to keep the fuel alive. I cook mush with vegetables. This is all my family is ever given.\nI feed the hen and three rabbits their dinner. I grow attached to the rabbits, even though I know I shouldn't. I name them. I'm not getting enough to eat; it's time to decide whether or not to kill the rabbits. I feel pain but it's a privileged child's pain because I know I will soon be eating again. That's not true for a lot of other children around the world.\nGrowing up comfortably in the U.S., I've never had to worry about my dinner, and even though this whole process was only a  _ , it changed my life. Now I believe in doing whatever I can to help find practical ways to defeat hunger.\nSo I've become president of Roots and Shoots, a group working to improve local environments for people and animals. I'm also working to create a program at my high school called the \"Safe Passage\" trip to help young people in the Guatemala City dump. And I've got plans to do more.\nI'm often thinking of laboring in the hot sun and the millions who still do. Now, I try to live for today and stop worrying so much about the future. When I eat or feel full, I am grateful for this fortunate life and want to extend the same feeling to others.\nI believe in offering help to those who need it.\nQuestion: What influence did the author's experience in the \"Tribal Village\" have on her?\nAnswer:",

Researchers found great differences in both air pollution and the length of life in the two areas.\n\"This study provides a unique basis for the question about the life span in northern China because the heating policy dramatically changes pollution concentrations ,\" Michael Greenstone, a professor of environmental economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an email, \"Further,due to the low rates of migration in China in this period, we can know people's exposure over long periods\".\nThe policy gave free coal for fuel boilers to heat homes and offices to cities north of the Huai River which divides China into north and south. It was in effect for much of the 1950-1980 period, of central planning,and though such policy was stopped after 1980, the practice of heavy coal burning in the north goes on, which releases heavy pollutants into the air that can harm human health.Researchers found no other government policies that treated China's north differently from the south.\nThe researchers collected data for 90 cities, from 1981 to 2000, on the annual daily average concentration of total particulates sent out from power stations,construction sites and vehicles. Among them, PM2.5 is of especially great health concern because it can go deep into the lungs. \nThe researchers estimated the impact on the length of life using death data from 1991-2000.They found that in the north, the concentration of pollutants was 184 micrograms per cubic meter, 55 percent higher than in the south, and life length is 55 years lower on average.\nQuestion: Where can you most probably read this passage?\nOptions: A: On a fashion website.\nB: In a science paper.\nC: In a guide book.\nD: In a health magazine.",

All of these things of the modern world make life entertaining and enjoyable. But our 21st-century lifestyle is also loud and, if we don't take notice, it can have an effect on our hearing.\nMost teenagers don't think about hearing loss. But if you experience any of the followingsymptoms , you may already be hearing damaged: you make efforts to hear normal talk, you have to turn up the TV or radio so high that others complain, you watch other people's expressions to understand what they are saying, you ask people to repeat themselves, you misunderstand what people are saying or you hear ringing in your ears.\niPods and other MP3 players are as common as the clothes you wear, and just as fashionable. But if you turn up an iPod to more than 60 percent of itsmaximum volume , and listen to music for more than an hour, you are asking for trouble. And, it does not matter if the music you play is classical, rock or heavy metal.\nSome researchers find that young people who break the so-called 60-percent/60-minute rule in listening to iPods are at the risk of suffering hearing loss.\nWhy is an iPod dangerous? With ear buds placed directly in the ear canal and high-volume music played over a long period of time, it's like working in a loud factory all day, being amaintenance person under a jet airplane or using ajackhammer on a building site.\nSimilarly, iPod music can cause a short time orpermanent hearing damage. A loud iPod can cause aruptured eardrum and, over time, may cause permanent damage to the tiny hairs in the inner ear. If these tiny hairs are damaged, they cannot effectively send sounds to theauditory nerves that connect to the brain. If this happens, hearing loss becomes permanent.\nQuestion: Which of the following shows that you are suffering hearing loss?\nOptions: A: You are interested to listen to others' talking.\nB: You have to read others' expressions to understand them.\nC: You can only understand others over the phone.\nD: You always think you hear the ringing of the phone.",

Most people were not willing to work on farms along the Atlantic because they worried about the terrible storms that destroy buildings and crops. The farmer received a steady stream of refusals at the interview for a farmhand\nFinally, a short, thin man approached the farmer. \"Are you a good farmhand?\" the farmer asked him.\n\"Well, I can sleep when the wind blows. \" answered the little man.\nAlthough puzzled by this answer ,the farmer, desperate for help, hired him. The little man worked well around the farm ,busy from dawn to dusk, and the farmer felt satisfied with the man's work.\nThen one night the wind howled loudly from offshore. Jumping out of bed,the farmer grabbed a lantern and rushed next door to the hired hand's sleeping quarters. He shook the little man and yelled, \" Get up! A storm is coming! Tie things down before they are blown away! \"\nThe little man rolled over in bed and said firmly, \"No sir. I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows. \"\nEnraged  by the response, the farmer was tempted to fire  him on the spot ,Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm. To his amazement,he discovered that all of the hay had been covered. The cows were in the bam,the chickens were in the coops,and the doors were barred The shutters were tightly secured. Everything was tied down, Nothing could be blown away.\nThe farmer then understood what his hired hand meant, so he also returned to his bed to sleep while the wind was still blowing.\nQuestion: The farmer felt amazed because   _\n- the Little man was sleeping\n- everything was in safety\n- the wind was too strong\n- he could not open the doors",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: How many times do you check your Moments or Facebook page in a day to see whether your latest post has got another \"like\" or \"thumbs up\"?\nAlthough you might be embarrassed to admit how many times you do this, don't worry. Psychological findings have shown it's completely normal.\nIn fact, the pleasure we derive from   getting a \"like\" is equal to that of eating chocolate or winning money, and we can't help wanting more.\nAccording to the findings of the UCLA Brain Mapping Center, which observed 32 teens aged between 13 and 18, the feedback circuit   in the teens' brains are particularly sensitive, and the \"social\" and \"visual\" parts of their brains were activated when they received \"likes\" on a social network. The research also showed that though the thumbs up might come from complete strangers, the good they derive from it worked equally.\nSo does it mean we should try our best to win as many thumbs up as possible?\nNot necessarily so if we know the reasons behind our desire for attention.\nIn \"Why do people crave   attention\" by M. Farouk Radwan, he explained several cases in which people naturally longed for attention. Radwan said people who were an only child, who were used to being the center of attention in their house, may try to reproduce these conditions. Feeling \"overlooked and unappreciated\" might also lead you to be eager for attention. Other times, the state of being jealous or wanting to cover your mistakes may also contribute to such longings.\nIn fact, too much desire for attention can create anxiety, and in turn ruin your happiness even when you get it. So what can we do about it? The answer is quite simple.\n\"If people could adopt goals not focused on their own self-esteem   but on something larger than their self, such as what they can create or contribute to others, they would be less sensitive to some of the negative effects of pursuing self-esteem,\" wrote psychology professor Jennifer Crocker in the Journal of Social Issues.\nQuestion: You may find this text in a magazine about   _  .\nOptions: A: technology\nB: education\nC: entertainment\nD: social life",

Two weeks later, the recall was extended to more than 400 consumer products made since Jan. 1, 2007, including Jenny Craig nutritional bars and Keebler Peanut Butter Sandwich Crackers, while the toll from the contamination had reached eight dead and more than 500 sickened in 43 states, half of them children.\n   The company's factory in Blakely,Ga., which was the source of the contamination, supplied some of the largest food makers in the nation. The outbreak showed the complexities of the industrial food chain, and left consumers to figure out if some food in their cabinets had a danger. The recall of peanut products is the latest in a series of increasingly severe food contamination scares involving tomatoes, spinach, cantaloupes and other foods.\n   TheGeorgiaplant, which is closed, packed peanut butter in bulk ranging from 5 to 1,700 pounds, much of which was shipped to institutions. Many school districts have pulled peanut butter from menus, with some substituting more commonly recognized supermarket brands. New York City school officials said they had not bought any peanut butter or products with ingredients that originated at theGeorgiaplant.\n   An F.D.A. inspection team that visited the plant on Jan. 9 discovered that on 12 occasions in 2007 and 2008 tests conducted by the company found salmonella contamination in its products but that it shipped the contaminated products to customers after a retest found no contamination and did nothing to clean the plant.\nQuestion: The passage is mainly about  _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"a recall for peanut products of a company\"?",

He left school at 16 with only two scores for secondary school subjects. One of the reasons that made it cool for him not to care was the power of his peer  group.\nThe lack of right male  role models in many of their lives -- at home and particularly in the school environment  -- means that their peers are the only people they have to judge themselves against.\nThey don't see men succeeding in society so it doesn't occur to them that they could make something of themselves. Without male teachers as a role model, the effect of peer actions and street culture  is all-powerful. Boys want to be part of a club. However, schools can provide the environment for change, and provide the right role models for them. Teachers need to be trained to stop that but not in front of a child's peers. You have to do it one to one, because that is when you see the real child.\nIt's pointless sending a child home if he or she has done wrong. They see it as a welcome day off to watch television or play computer games. Instead, schools should have a special unit where a child who has done wrong goes for the day and gets advice about his problems -- somewhere he can work away from his peers and go home after the other children.",

He is a hard worker, who also loves to run and play. In short, he's an ideal friend and a heroic character.\nHere is the thing: Joey is a horse, who appears as the main character in Steven Spielberg's new film War Horse.\nIt is based on Michael Morpurgo's 1982 novel, which also caused the same-titled Tony Awards winning play.\nThe film follows the saga of Joey, a racehorse that's trained for farm work under the loving care of Albert (Jeremy Irvine )after Albert's drunk father Ted(Peter Mullan ) overpays for the animal at auction .\nThen the World War I tears Albert and Joey apart. Joey is sold into the war effort for the British and starts his episodic adventures in Europe.\nSplendidly staged, the battle plots in the film are visually\nand impressive.\nAnd with Spielberg's unique, top-notch direction and storytelling skills, War Horse cannot escape its episodic nature, calling to mind another Spielberg film about the horrors of war and its effects upon soldiers and civilians--Saving Private Ryan.\nWhile that film shocked with horrific scenes of bleeding, it relied on a company of easily-described characters and a focused storyline to present heroic themes.\nLike Saving Private Ryan, War Horse clings to a series of characters, not only Albert, but also British officers, French civilians and German soldiers, who display courage in the face of danger. Everyone who comes in contact with Joey is either already in touch with their inner angel or is quickly moved to become more humane.\nAlthough none of this covers the fact that we've seen this stuff elsewhere before, the lovely sentiment will steal your heart.\nAnd the emotional signature of Spielberg can be felt as he establishes the relationship between the boy and the horse and the mood of the piece - there will be tears.\nTherefore, calling this beautiful, dramatically incomplete film \" Saving Private Joey\", is entirely justifiable.\nOptions:\nA War Horse is based on the same-titled novel by Steven Spielberg.\nB Joey is a heroic character because he saved many people's lives.\nC Albert sold Joey into the war effort for Europe.\nD Joey came to Albert's care after Ted paid a lot of money for it.\nAnswer:\nD Joey came to Albert's care after Ted paid a lot of money for it.\nQuestion:",

        "You cannot say that it's entirely true that kids learn a second language easily, but it's still the best time to learn. Babies are basically equipped to hear and distinguish every possible language and dialect, but once they reach 6 months old, they begin to focus on the particular sounds that exist in the languages that they're exposed to. In this way, kids will naturally and automatically be bilingual  if they hear multiple languages on a daily basis when they are still babies.\nOne lady told me of her son who grew up in a very multi-cultural community working at a resort. He would naturally and easily switch from Dutch, to French, to Italian, German and English depending on who he was talking to. Of course that's an extreme case, but it's completely possible and easy.\nIt's not true that they will get mixed up by learning multiple languages. They may mix them up purposely simply because certain words or expressions are easier, but they won't develop any permanent language disabilities. Quite the contrary, bilingual children have been shown to be as much as a year more advanced in learning ability development for 2 and 3 years olds.\nSome kids who simply aren't gifted at learning languages, just as some aren't gifted at sports or music, will find it difficult to continue schooling in a foreign language. In that case, it may be better not to continue with the foreign language school. Perhaps for Grade Two you could try a bilingual school.\nIn any case, learning even a small amount of a foreign language, maintaining the ability to hear and pronounce it by listening to music and movies will keep a foundation for later learning. Knowing a second language can be a great benefit for gaining employment.\nThe lady told us that her son  _  .\nA) was working in a multi-community\nB) could speak five kinds of languages\nC) was learning some different languages\nD) could talk with many people at the same time",

Based on a random sampling method, the survey, done in May last year, investigated about 1,095 people living in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xinjiang, Jinzhong, and Luzhou. All these people were aged between 18 and 60. The survey shows that 55.5% of the parents did not know who their children's best friends were. Fathers, in particular, knew even less about their children than mothers, as the survey shows only 33.8% of fathers knew who their children's best friends were while 50.8% of mothers did so, China Youth Daily reported.\nParents with little education were less concerned with their children's life, or whom their children played with. The survey shows that among parents that graduated from primary schools or without any educational background, only 33.1% knew who their children's best friends were. Among parents that had received middle school education, the related proportion reached 45.5%.\nThis year's survey was also based on random sampling. In May 2007, the Horizon Research Group investigated some 1,456 families in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Changsha, Xi'an, Chengdu and Harbin. The survey shows that children under the age of 12 play for less time with their playmates than their parents did when they were young.\nThe survey also shows that most children at present spend only 21.9% of their time playing with their friends, while their parents spent 36.8% of their time with their playmates when they were young. Nowadays, most children spend more time with their grandparents or babysitters than with their parents.\nQuestion: What can be inferred from the passage?\nOptions: A: Parents need to take their responsibilities for their children.\nB: Parents should provide better conditions for their children.\nC: Parents don't play an important part in the growth of their children now.\nD: Parents should let their children have more friends.",

        "Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: When women sit together to watch a movie on TV, they usually talk simultaneously  about a variety of subjects, including children, men, careers and what's happening in their lives. When groups of men and women watch a movie together, the men usually end up telling the women to shut up. Men can either talk or watch the screen--they can't do both--and they don't understand that women can. Besides, women consider that the point of all getting together is to have a good time and develop relationships--not just to sit there like couch potatoes staring at the screen.\nDuring the ad breaks, a man often asks a woman to explain the plot and tell him where the relationship between the characters is going. He is unable, unlike women, to read the subtle body language signals that reveal how the characters are feeling emotionally. Since women originally spent their days with the other women and children in the group, they developed the ability to communicate successfully in order to maintain relationships. For a woman, speech continues to have such a clear purpose: to build relationships and make friends. For men, to talk is to relate the facts.\nMen see the telephone as a communication tool for sending facts and information to other people, but a woman sees it as a means of bonding . A woman can spend two weeks on vacation with her girlfriend and, when she returns home, telephone the same girlfriend and talk for another two hours.\nThere is no convincing evidence that social conditioning, the fact that girls' mothers talked to them more, is the reason why girls talk more than boys. Psychiatrist Dr Michael Lewis, author of Social Behaviour and Language Acquisition, conducted experiments that found mothers talked to, and looked at, baby girls more often than baby boys. Scientific evidence shows parents respond to the brains of their children. Since a girl's brain is better organized to send and receive speech, we therefore talk to them more. Consequently, mothers who try to talk to their sons are usually disappointed to...\nQuestion: After a vacation with her girlfriend, a woman would talk to her again on the phone for hours in order to  _  .\nAnswer:",

        "Article: You and your friends are settling into your seats. The new Spider-Man movie is about to start and you've got the snacks: soda and popcorn. Food is part of what makes the movies fun.\nJust as the lights go out, you catch a slight smell of ... tuna fish?! You turn your head, searching for the source. Then you spot him: A couple rows back, some guy is enjoying a tuna fish sandwich. How'd he get that in here? You wonder. Then you remember how much you paid for your snacks.\nWhat invites the unwelcome outside food is probably the price. Why pay $ 5 for a bag of M&Ms when you can get them for a dollar at the corner store?\nEarlier this year, a Michigan man decided to fight for his right to snack. Joshua Thompson is using his local theater after it banned outside food. He argues the ban breaks a Michigan law that prevents businesses from charging extremely high prices. However, most legal experts believe Thompson has little chance of winning his case, though he does have a point: 85 cents out of a dollar of treats a movie theater sells is pure profit .\nThe truth is that movie theaters are more in the snack business than the movie business. A huge part of the ticket income goes to the Hollywood studio. This makes sense, since the studios have to pay the costs of movie production and advertising. But that often doesn't leave much cash for the theater, which also has its own running costs. If customers stopped buying food, owners would have to raise ticket prices even higher.\nOf course, there's another reason to think twice before bringing food into the movies: It's against the rules. Breaking those rules can have unpleasant consequences too. Some theaters will kick you out if they catch you. Even without the threat of punishment, we should follow rules all the time------out of respect.\nHere's a good idea: Eat before the movie.\nQuestion: How does the author feel about bringing outside food into the cinema?\nYes or no, is the answer \"It is unacceptable.\"?",

It is the driest place in North America with an average rainfall of only 1.96 inches a year. Death Valley also boasts  the lowest point in the western hemisphere.\nDeath Valley got its name in 1849, when a group of emigrants  were looking for a short cut to the gold fields of California. They were given the bad advice and went into the valley. Some of them were killed by the bad weather and harsh roads. When the rest finally walked out, they gave the area its name by saying to it \"goodbye, Death Valley\".\nAs the name might suggest, there is very little apparent vegetation  within Death Valley. First impression, however, can be deceiving . Death Valley includes more than 1,000 species of plants that have adapted to the harsh conditions.\nDeath Valley is also a land of beauties.

During his stay in China, he saw many wonderful things. One of the things he discovered was that the Chinese used paper money. In western countries, people didn't use the paper money until 15thcentury. However, people in China began to use paper money in the 7thcentury.\nA Chinese man called Cai Lun invented paper almost 2,000 years ago. He took the wood from trees and made it into paper. He then put these pieces of paper together and made them into a book.\nNow paper still comes from trees. We use a lot of paper every day. If we keep on wasting so much paper, there will not be any trees left on the earth. If there are no trees, there will be no paper. Every day, people throw away about 2,800 tons of paper in our city. It takes 17 trees to make one ton of paper. This means that we are cutting nearly 48,000 trees every day. Since it takes more than 10 years for a tree to grow, we must start using less paper now.\nSo how can we save paper? We can use both sides of every piece of paper, especially when we are making notes. We can use cotton handkerchiefs and not paper ones. When we go shopping, we can use fewer paper bags. If the shop assistant gives us a paper bag, we can save it and reuse it later.\nEveryone can help to save paper. If we all think carefully, we can help protect trees. But we should do it now, before it is too late.\nQuestion: Which of the following is not a way of saving paper?\nOptions: A: To use both sides of every piece of paper\nB: To use fewer paper bags when shopping\nC: To use cotton handkerchiefs instead of paper ones\nD: To grow more trees",

Now Evolta, Panasonic's 7-inch Humanoid Robot is getting ready for his biggest challenge -- the Ironman Triathlon   Championship in Hawaii.\n         To compete in this exhausting contest, the green & white robot which is small enough to fit on a human palm, will have to swim 2.4 miles in the rough ocean, bike 112 miles across the hot Hawaiian desert and, run a full marathon distance of 26.2 miles in the painfully hot weather.\n         Given that he is so tiny and powered by rechargeable batteries   of Panasonic, he will be allowed some freedom in the way he competes. For one, he will be starting the race on October 23rd, 2011, three weeks following the real event and, while human competitors have at most 17 hours to complete the triathlon, Evolta will be given 7 days, during which his only \"breaks\" will be to recharge his batteries.\n         The biggest difference however, will be that unlike a single human body doing all three races, there will be three different \"Evolta\" robot bodies competing -- each built for the specific race. Evolta the swimmer will be equipped with special arms to swim forward. Evolta the biker, will be on a little two-wheeler with training wheels, while Evolta the runner, will be fixed on what looks like a wheel.\n         In spite of all these advantages, the robot's creator Tomotaka Takahashi believes that the race will be a huge challenge -- not only will Evolta have to battle the wind and sun, but also, small road obstacles   that humans just step over. The water will be even worse thanks to the strong waves, tides and ocean winds. But if he does complete it, Evolta will add another feather in his cap and just prove the already well-known fact that Panasonic's rechargeable Evolta batteries are indeed the \"world's longest-lasting batteries\"!\nQuestion: When competing in the triathlon, Evolta   _  .\nOptions: A: has to finish the competition in 17 hours\nB: will be allowed to have a break from time to time\nC: will start three weeks earlier than other competitors\nD: will have three specially-built bodies for the competition",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\nArticle: Some say college is wasted on the young. So many of us look back at our own college years and realize what we could have done differently to make the most of them. While we can't go back, we certainly can offer our sons and daughters our best advice to help them make the right choices in college. Hopefully, they will have fewer regrets than we do. Following are five guidelines parents can share with their college-bound kids to put the whole experience in perspective.\nEDUCATION IS YOUR FIRST PRIORITY\nAs soon as you arrive on campus, there will be competing interests. Feel free to check them out but always remember that you are there first and foremost for your education. Go to class prepared and on time. Be engaged during class. Make sure your professor knows you and realizes that you care.\nBE RESPONSIBLE\nThere are many layers of responsibility. Do what you say you will do and, if you can't, own up to it early and communicate clearly. But being responsible isn't just about meeting your commitments; it is also about taking care of you, your body, and your friends. For example, more than 1800 college students die annually from alcohol-related injuries. Look out for yourself and other people. Make moderate, sensible decisions so you aren't reeling from the consequences later.\nTAKE THE OPPORTUNITY\nIncredible opportunities will present themselves: studying abroad, interning at a unique place, trying new things. Don't let fear prevent you from taking advantage of them. There may never be so much time or as many resources devoted to your betterment again in your life. Say yes to opportunities that will help you grow.\nFIND AND BE A MENTOR\nSome of the best lessons available to us can come outside of the classroom in the form of a mentor. One of the most powerful growth opportunities is being a mentor. Early on, find someone on campus who you feel can help you grow and develop a relationship with him or her. Also find someone for you to mentor. You will reinforce and enrich your own learning experience by teaching...\nOptions:\nA taking part in different activities\nB working hard to get a degree\nC seizing every chance to try new things\nD improving themselves by learning from the others\nAnswer:\nB working hard to get a degree\nQuestion:",

I noticed right away that the parking area was very busy.\nAs I was about to exit my car, a lady was about to enter her car to leave. She was parked on the opposite side of me and there was a four way stop behind our parking areas. As the lady tried to back out to leave, some of the shoppers were extremely rude to her. They shouted and beeped their horns  at the lady and she had a look of terror on her face. She looked at me and threw up both of her hands as if she didn't know what to do.\nI gestured  for the lady to put her window down and I told her that she was doing just fine. She smiled and seemed to relax. I then became her rear view mirror as it was hard for her to see behind her while backing out of the parking space. As I watched for safety, she was able to back out enough to drive forward.\nAt this point, she was smiling broadly!She thanked me many times.

Fighting to stay above the waters , she had to choose which one would have to take his chances in the swirling torrent  .\n\"I knew I had to let go of one of them and I just thought I'd better let go of the one that's the older,\" she told Sky News television in a report broadcast on Thursday.

        "Read the article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Almost every day we come across situations in which we have to make decisions one way or another. Choice, we are given to believe, is a right. But for a good many people in the world, in rich and poor countries, choice is a luxury, something wonderful but hard to get, not a right. And for those who think they are exercising their right to make choices, the whole system is merely an illusion, a false idea created by companies and advertisers hoping to sell their products.\nThe endless choice gives birth to anxiety in people's life. Buying something as basic as a coffee pot is not exactly simple. Easy access to a wide range of everyday goods leads to a sense of powerlessness in many people, ending in the shopper giving up and walking away, or just buying an unsuitable item that is not really wanted. Recent studies in England have shown that many electrical goods bought in almost every family are not really needed. More difficult decision-making is then either avoided or trusted into the hands of the professionals, lifestyle instructors, or advisors.\nIt is not just the availability of the goods that is the problem, but the speed with which new types of products come on the market. Advances in design and production help quicken the process. Products also need to have a short lifespan so that the public can be persuaded to replace them within a short time. The typical example is computers, which are almost out-of-date once they are bought. This indeed makes selection a problem. Gone are the days when one could just walk with ease into a shop and buy one thing: no choice, no anxiety.\nQuestion: What is the passage mainly about?\nOptions: A: The variety of choices in modern society.\nB: The opinions on people's right in different countries.\nC: The problem about the availability of everyday goods.\nD: The helplessness in purchasing decisions.",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article:\nArticle: Like many other small boys, I was fascinated by cars, not least because my oldest brother was a bit of a car guy and subscribed to cool magazines like Car and Driver and Motor Trend. Every so often, one of those magazines would run an article on the \"Car of the Future\". They featured unconventional styling and things like small nuclear reactors as power sources. Yet, frankly, my car doesn't do anything that my brother's Studebaker didn't do. It goes, it stops, it burns gasoline, it plays music. I still have to steer it, and it still runs into things if I don't steer it carefully.\nBut guess what? All of these things are subject to change in the not-so-distant future. It will still go and stop, but it may not burn gasoline, I may not have to steer it, and it may be a lot better at not running into things.\nAirbags aren't the be-all and end-all in safety. In fact, considering the recent news about people occasionally being killed by their airbags in low-speed collisions  ,they obviously still need some development. But they aren't going away, and in fact, you can expect to see cars appearing with additional, side-impact airbags, something some European car manufacturers already offer.\nBetter than systems to minimize   injury in the event of an accident, however, are systems that minimize the likelihood of an accident happening in the first place. Future cars may be able to eliminate many of the major causes of accidents, including drunk-driving, tailgating   and sleepiness. Cars could be equipped with sensors that can detect alcohol in a driver's system and prevent the car from being started, for example. Many accidents are caused by people following the car in front too closely. As early as next year, you'll be able to buy cars with radar-equipped control systems. If the radar determines you're closing too quickly with the car in front, it will ease up on the throttle  . For city streets, expect other radar devices that will give advance warning that the car in front of you has slowed abruptly   and you should...",

A recent study found that kids live longer when a grandmother takes part in their daily lives. \nMost animals die soon after their childbearing years are over. Women, however, often live for many years after they stop having kids. \n To try to understand why, researchers from Finland looked at birth and death records of two communities from the 18th and 19th centuries, one in Finland and one in Canada. In these communities, 537 Finnish women and 3,290 Canadian women were grandmothers who had lived past the age of 50. \n  For every decade they lived beyond 50, the researchers found that the women ended up with an average of two extra grandkids. It didn't matter what the differences in health or living conditions were between the two communities or from family to family. \n Grandchildren were also more likely to live into adulthood if their grandmothers were alive when they were born. If their grandmothers were younger than 60 at the time, that was even better. The study also found that women had children 2 to 3 years earlier if their own mothers were still alive at that time than those whose mothers had died. \n  The researchers suggested that grandmothers have provided important assistance in raising their grandchildren for at least the past 200,000 years. As a result, they helped extend everyone's lifespan. \n  So, don't take your grandma for granted!\nOptions:\nA She was also more likely to live into adulthood.\nB She had children 2 to 3 years earlier.\nC She ended up with an average of two extra grandkids.\nD It had no influence on her.\nAnswer:\nB She had children 2 to 3 years earlier.\nQuestion:",

Here in New England where I have fished commercially for 45 years, we are beginning a recovery from years of over fishing. Under the newly authorized Magnuson-Stevens Act, fishermen are forming partnerships with scientists for the purpose of developing fishing-gear modifications   to reduce by-catch and reduce impacts   to fish habitat. Additionally, we are collecting information on fish stock abundance, population, and ecosystems. The New England Regional Fishery Management Council is supporting the formation of harvest districts, which enables fishermen to have changing market conditions.                                                                    \nFrank Mirarchi\n                                                Scituate,Massachusetts \nYou described fishing around the world, but not here in the United States. There is no support for the American fisherman who is working under the harshest regulations on Earth and the strictest restrictions. We are fishing in a fashion that is completely suitable as required in the Magnuson-Stevens Act. TheU.S.keeps importing more fish from countries that have no requirements on gear or on their catch.U.S.fishermen cannot compete with foreign prices, so the fishermen's numbers have been reduced.

To try to replicate   something that is so poorly understood may therefore seem like pride. But you have to start somewhere, and International Business Machines (IBM) and the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), in Switzerland, propose to start by replicating \"in silico\", one of the brain's building blocks.\nIn a partnership announced, the two organizations said they would be working together to build a simulation   of a structure known as a neo-cortical column on a type of IBM supercomputer that is currently used to study the molecular functioning of genes. If that works, they plan to use more powerful computers to link such simulated columns together into something that mimics  a brain.\nIn a real brain, a neo-cortical column is a cylindrical element about a third of a millimeter in diameter and three millimeters long. It is these columns, arranged side by side like the cells of a honeycomb, which make up the famous \"grey matter\" that has become shorthand for human intelligence. The Blue Gene/L supercomputer that will be used for the simulation consists of enough independent processors for each to be programmed to mimic an individual nerve cell in a column.\nThe EPFL's contribution to the Blue Brain Project will be to create a digital description of how the columns behave. The database from its Brain Mind Institute will provide the raw material for the simulation. Biologists and computer scientists will then connect the artificial nerve cells up in a way that mimics nature. They will do so by assigning electrical properties to them, and telling them how to communicate with each other and how they should modify their connections with one another depending on their activity.\nThat will be no mean feat. Even a single nerve cell is complicated, not least because each one has about 10,000 connections with others. And nerve cells come...\nOptions:\nA A science fiction\nB A research report\nC An official document\nD A computer advertisement\nAnswer:\nB A research report\nQuestion:",

A statement from William and Catherine's settlement  Kensington Palace said the baby, third in line to the throne , would be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge.\nOn Wednesday the royal couple took their son to Catherine's parents' house in Berkshire, following a half-hour visit by the Queen. All three names had been among the favourites listed by British bookmakers and the announcement was relatively quick by royal standards. It took a month for the name ofPrince Charles, the heir to the throne, to be announced, and a week for William, his eldest son.\nGeorge has been the name of six British kings. The last, George VI, was the father of Queen Elizabeth II and _ from 1936 to 1952. Alexandra, the female form of Alexander, is one of the Queen's middle names and was also the name of the Queen mate of King Edward VII at the start of the last century. Louis is one of William's middle names and was the given name of Prince Charles's tutor and great-uncle Louis Mountbatten, who was murdered by the IRA in 1979.\nThe choice of name, relatively short by royal standards, does not necessarily mean the baby will eventually become King George VII. The Queen's father was named Albert, but chose to be crowned as George VI.\n\"It's interesting that they chose to go with just three names,\" historian Suzannah Lipscomb told Sky News. \"It's almost as if the royal family is coming down with ordinary people, who tend to have fewer middle names than monarchs .It is a name that none can find any problems with. George itself can't be shortened in any obvious offensive way. They've probably gone for something that is safe.\"\nOptions:\nA the name of an ordinary person is simple but meaningful .\nB George itself can't be simplified in any obvious offensive way.\nC a monarch or a prince has usually more names in the middle than the ordinary people.\nD a person with more middle names must be a monarch or a prince .\nAnswer:\nC a monarch or a prince has usually more names in the middle than the ordinary people.\nQuestion:",

        "Read the article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Last week, we explained that the planet Mars has passed \"opposition. \"It passed a point opposite the Sun. This week, we tell about the planet's surprising motion among the stars. \nFor thousands of years, people have recognized that planets travel among the stars. The planets generally follow the path taken by the Sun through the sky. The Sun's path is called the ecliptic. The groups of stars along the ecliptic are called the Zodiac. \nThe motion of the planets can be confusing at times. Everyone knows the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west. But this is caused by the turning motion of the Earth. Planets generally move from west to east. \nHowever, Mars will appear to move backward for about two months this year. This happens because the Earth is overtaking Mars on its way around the Sun. Mars began its backward, or westward, motion on May 11th, It will start moving eastward again on July 19th. \nMars' apparent motion has been a mystery to astronomers for hundreds of years. Most early theories of the solar system argued that the Sun and planets turned around the Earth. But the sudden westward motion of Mars presented a problem. Why would Mars move west for two months when it nears \"opposition\"?\nIn 1543, a Polish church worker named Nicolas Copernicus published a different theory. His theory said the Earth and planets moved around the Sun in perfectly circular orbits. Copernicus' theory was simpler. But his Sun - centered system still did not explain the observed motion of Mars very well.\nFinally, a German mathematician named Johannes Kepler published a complete theory of the motion of the planets in 1619. He had carefully studied the motion of Mars for many years.\nJohannes Kepler discovered that the planets do not move in circular orbits around the sun. Instead, they travel in flattened orbits called ellipses. Mars' elliptical orbit is the cause of its unusual brightening this year and its apparent large size.\nDuring the next several weeks, you can see for yourself why the mysterious motion of Mars has...\nQuestion: On July 19th Mars_.\nOptions: A: will pass the \"opposition\"\nB: appears to change its direction again\nC: will begin to move westward\nD: appears to change its orbit again",

Loneliness and other anxiety problems - worrying about life's pressures - can even lead to self-murder.\n         An article in China Daily gave no reason for this other than the usual blaming of the post-80s generation. According to a high level official, young people suffering from discouragement are mostly \"spoiled and have not been taught to be independent, responsible and express 'thank-you'.\" Well, how do you like that? First, I don't think China's youth are exactly spoiled. They certainly have more things than their parents did, but a lot of the money spent on them is for their education including various extra classes.\n         Discouragement and anxiety are now the fastest growing challenges in modern societies. We sense a lack of close friends who can talk to honestly and openly. In 1985, a US study found that one in ten people did not have such a friend. In 2006, it was one in four. It's easy to see the connection between loneliness and discouragement. But what actually causes this increasing loneliness?\n         Surely, with Internet social networking sites such as Kaixin, we have more friends than ever. A new study has shown that the more time teenagers spend in front of computers, the less close they are to friends and family.Kaixinor QQ may be fun but it lacks meaning, compared to personal connections in the real world.\n         And then there are those endless online games popular with young Chinese but increasingly there are more interesting choices. For example, new sports such as skateboarding are starting to catch on in bigger cities, as is playing music in a band. These creative hobbies are done in a group and thus friendship can be stronger. Hopefully young people will also be drawn out of the Internet cafes and interactive computer games that in fact fail to recreate a real and interactive experience.\nQuestion: What does the writer think of the Internet social networking site Kaixin?\n- Open but ridiculous.\n- Funny but meaningless.\n- Real and interesting.\n- Honest and responsible.",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: Rare birds in the UK have been living far better than the more common birds over the last decade due to the efforts of conservation organisations, according to a new assessment.\nThe research shows almost 60% of the 63 rare birds that live in the UK have increased over the last 10 years.\nBy contrast, only about one third of common species have increased over the same period. Just 28% of rare birds have decreased over the same period, compared with four out of every 10 common birds. The rare birds described in the assessment with increasing populations include theosprey  andcorncrake . All of these birds are subject to conservation action.\nThe declining common birds include the nightingale,swift , house sparrow and redgrouse  . These are suffering declines for a variety of reasons, including changes in farming practices.\nDr David Noble, from the British Trust for Ornithology, said: \"That some of our rarer birds have responded to targeted conservation action is great news. It shows just what can be achieved. What we need to do now is to continue the good work and use some of the lessons we have learned to help our more common birds.\"\nDr Mark Avery, the conservation director of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), said: \"Over the last decade we've enjoyed some great conservation successes, including removing some threatened species from the World Conservation Union's Red List of Thratened Animals and increasing the populations of red kite, osprey, etc. However, these successes arecountered  by continued declines of some widespread species.\"\nThe overview of 210 native birds has been produced by a group of conservation organisations, to mark the publication ofThe State of the UK's Birdsreport, which is in its l0th year. The report was published by the RSPB for a group of conservation organisations.\nQuestion: The passage is most likely to be found in a book about  _  .\nOptions: A: popular science\nB: historical events\nC: nature\nD: society",

        "Article: Dear Dr. White,\nWelcome to Philadelphia! Welcome to The City of Brotherly Love! We have some amazing historic sites to see during your stay. Do take advantage of them. You may have seen the filmThePhiladelphiaStory. Actually it is a comedy and still popular among the young though it was shot in the 1940s.\n\"The City of Brotherly Love\", the favored nickname for Philadelphia, is more popular. The name, Philadelphia, which means\"brotherly love\", is an ancient name that can be found in the Bible. Late in the 17th century, Philadelphia's founding father, William Penn, borrowed the name because its meaning represented his own beliefs.\nOur first stop will be the Franklin Institute which is one of the country's best science museums. The scientist and inventor Benjamin Franklin would take pride in the impressive museum named for him and presenting one of the major focuses of his life work -- spreading knowledge of the universe through science. It's the most visited museum and surely the most fun. Benjamin Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Also Franklin was a leading author, printer, politician, scientist, musician, inventor, statesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories regarding electricity. He earned the title of\"The First American\"for his campaigning for colonial unity; as an author and spokesman in London for several colonies, then as the first United States Ambassador to France, he contributed much to the building of the American nation.\nWe won't miss Please Touch Museum too. The straightforward name of this museum is accurate: As the first museum in the nation to target children aged seven and younger, Please Touch Museum encourages children to learn through active touching and doing. It is certainly one of the best places for kids.\nPhiladelphia is also unique in that it has a\"State Store\"system for non-alcoholic beer sales. Wine and spirits  are only sold at stores operated by...\nQuestion: What would Benjamin Franklin feel proud of in the Franklin Institute?\nYes or no, is the answer \"The effort of spreading knowledge through science.\"?",

        "Spending time with your kids is the best way to give them you attention. No matter whether you stay at home or work outside the home, you can still give quality time to your kids. Quality time doesn't mean the whole family sitting for four hours watching TV. It means turning the TV off and playing games together, reading books, going for walks---anything!\nGiving kids your attention means listening to them when they talk. I don't mean half-way listening and saying \"uh huh\" like we do to our spouses   when they're talking about their day at work. I mean sitting down, looking children in the eye, and listening. Ask questions. Be interested. It shows that you're paying attention, even if your question is just, \"So you say you painted the cat blue?\"\nRaising kids is not the time to be selfish with your time. You can be selfish later on when they're grown and having kids of their own. If you feel guilty about not being able to spend enough time with your kids, resist trying to buy their attention. You don't have to make every weekend a Disneyland day. And you don't have to continually buy them gifts as a means of letting them know you love them. The answer is \"time\". Time is what they want most from you.\nYour kids, no matter what age, are on some type of schedule. They get up, eat breakfast, eat lunch, eat dinner, etc. What do they do the rest of the time? Fill up some of the empty spots in their schedules with activities. Have them help you do something around the house or make them take part in a project with you. This is how day care workers are able to keep so many kids under control---they fill up the day with activities.\nThe author mentions day care workers to show the importance of letting kids  _  .\nA) eat well\nB) help parents\nC) do housework\nD) do activities",

It was taken down to make room for a new stadium. The blast  from the falling building caused the earth to shake as if an earthquake had happened \n \n      Scientists placed more than 200 earthquake recorders in the earth to measure the movement. They found which parts of the city shook the most. This information helped them know which parts of the city would be damaged in a real earthquake at an early time. \n      A real earthquake happened on February 28, 2001 in Seattle. The Nisqually earthquake was 6.8 on the Richter scale(6.8). It damaged the same parts of Seattle that scientists had predicted  from the pulling down of the Kingdome. It was a plate quake. It started deep in the earth, 37 miles below the surface on the Juan de Fuca Plate. Sometimes, huge plates under the earth cause earthquakes when the plates move against each other suddenly. \n       Scientists have learned that deep earthquakes have very few aftershocks . The Nisqually earthquake had only 4 ones. Another earthquake in California that was close to the surface had over 120 aftershocks. Scientists do not know why the deep earthquakes have fewer aftershocks. \n \n      Scientists plan to blast in the ground near Seattle with the purpose of testing the plate. The shockwaves from the blast will jump off the plate and give them an idea of where the plate is and how it is moving. This will give them more information in case another real earthquake hits the area.\nQuestion: Why were the scientists interested in the pulling down of the Seattle Kingdome?\nOptions: A: They wanted to see which areas near the Kingdome would shake the hardest.\nB: They wanted to predict what might happen in a real earthquake.\nC: They wanted to measure the movement of the Earth with earthquake recorders.\nD: All of the above.",

Newspapers, women's magazines, high schools and colleges are all encouraging millions of American women to do their own sewing, not only to make their own shirts and sweaters, but also to make nice clothes for their husbands, sons, or boyfriends. The lattes figures  show that over 89 million American women, because of the high costs of ready-to-wear clothing are now making almost all of their families' clothes. Most of these women get great satisfaction from making the family clothes on their own sewing machines. So it is natural that the demand  for excellent service of sewing machines is growing.\nThink of it! 89 million or more sewing machines, not including another 10 million sewing machines in schools of all kinds, need service at least once a year, and quite possibly four or more times each year. I know some women who return their sewing machines to repairmen time after time to get them fixed properly. I've seen sewing machines come out of repair shops in worse condition than they were when they went in.\nSo I've decided to write an introduction book to sewing-machine repair and teach people how to repair their own sewing machines at home.

        "Article: The two things - snow and mountains - which are needed for a ski area are the two things that cause avalanches, large mass of snow and ice crushing down the side of a mountain--often called \"White Death.\" \nIt was the threat of the avalanche and its record as a killer of man in the western mountains that created the snow ranger. He first started on avalanche control work in the winter of 1937 -38 at Alta, Utah, in Wasatch National Forest. \nThis mountain valley was becoming well known to skiers. It was dangerous. In fact, more than 120 persons had lost their lives in 1936 and another 200 died in 1937 as a result of avalanches before it became a major ski area. Thus, development of Alta and other major ski resorts in the west was dependent upon controlling the avalanche. The Forest Service set out to do it, and did, with its corps of snow rangers. It takes many things to make a snow ranger. The snow ranger must be in excellent physical condition. He must be a good skier and a skilled mountain climber He should have at least a high school education, and the more college courses in geology, physics, and related fields he has, the better. \nHe studies snow, terrain, wind, and weather. He learns the conditions that produce avalanches. He learns to forecast avalanches and to bring them roaring on down the mountainsides to reduce their killing strength. . The snow ranger learns to do this by using artillery, by blasting with TNT, and by the difficult and skillful art of skiing avalanches down. \nThe snow ranger, dressed in a green parka which has a bright yellow shoulder patch, means safety for people on ski slopes. He pulls the trigger on a 75 mm. Recoilless rifle, skis waist deep in powder testing snow stability, or talks with the ski area's operator as he goes about his work to protect the public from the hazards of deep snow on steep mountain slopes.\nQuestion: The snow rangers are employees of   _\nYes or no, is the answer \"the Forest Service.\"?",

As my mom and I headed towards the restaurant from our car, a girl about my age and her mother came up to us. They asked if we had any spare dollars. My mom immediately asked where they kept their things. They pointed to an old car in the parking across the street. The girl said there were six of them living in that car, the same size as my own family.\nMy mom said she had something to do after handing the people a few dollars. She sent me inside the restaurant with my dad and my three siblings  .But she didn't come.\nLater, I found out she had gone home and emptied our cupboards into a few bags. Then, she brought that food over to the car and handed the bags to the family. I wasn't there when that part happened, but I can imagine the joy it brought to their faces.\nA few days later, when I actually found out about what she had done, I asked her why she helped those people. She told me that they were not lucky. I remember the face of that girl who had asked us for dollars; she was the same age as me, yet our lives were so different.\nHere I stood, dressed in almost new clothes, headed to a restaurant and then back home to the bedroom I shared with my younger sister. I remember thinking that the girl didn't have any food to eat and that she was heading back to a cold car shared with five other people.\nAfter painting this picture in my mind, I understood my mom.

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: A few years ago, I was on a plane with my friend, waiting for it to take off. The pilot's voice was heard throughout the plane: \"Sorry for the delay, ladies and gentlemen. Our engines don't work. We are going to jump-start them. Once we get them going, we'll get up in the air and see what happens.\"\nThat was all he said. \"See what happens?\" Shouldn't we have had a better plan than that? At that point. I could only laugh nervously. One woman started crying, \"Oh no! We are going to crash!'' There were sighs of hopelessness and anxiety, and we hadn't even taken off yet.\nThe pilot even seemed unhappy. He told us our one engine was working double time, and his plan was to get up in the air and see what happens! Then we did. We got up in the air, and what happened? Nothing. We arrived in Norfolk, and no sooner had the wheels touched down than applause burst out as everyone on the airplane breathed a sigh of relief.\nWhile I do prefer planning better than \"see what happens\" when it comes to flying, it really isn't such a bad idea for life.All too often, people stop trying to achieve their goals just because they don't have a guaranteed result. But success will never be guaranteed. The best thing that you can do is just get up in the air, and see what happens. If your effort is to build a business then get up in the air and see what happens! Don't give yourself all the reasons why you can't. Do not wait until you have everything you need. You never will!\nIf your goal is to start a friendship, say \"Hello\", get up in the air and see what happens! The results could be very rewarding.\nIf your goal is to learn a new skill, get up in the air and see what happens! It might not be as difficult as your think. It could be fun!\nWhen traveling, i hope that my pilot has a more detailed plan than \"we will see what happens\" . But in life, it is not a bad strategy at all.\nQuestion: What is the main idea of this article ?\nOptions: A: \"we will see what happens\" is not a good plan for pilots\nB: Try to have everything prepared before you do something\nC: When you want to do something, you have to actually do it .\nD: Never stop chasing your goals even if they are certain to fail",

Kwon Yong-seok created the \"Prison Inside Me\"--a stress-reduction center with a punishment theme. People come here to cut themselves off from the outside world and pay to be kept in 60-square-foot (5.6-square-meter) cells  .\nLocated on the outskirts of Hongcheon, about 58 miles (93 km) northeast of Seoul, \"Prison Inside Me\" came to life after Mr. Kwon voluntarily asked to spend time behind bars for \"healing reasons,\" but his request was turned down. \"I didn't know how to stop working back then,\" he said. \"I felt like I was being swept away against my will, and it seemed I couldn't control my own life.\" So, Kwon and his wife Roh Ji-hyang decided to take matters into their own hands, and designed and built a prison-like spiritual center. The construction was completed in June last year and cost about 2 billion won ($19 million).\nThe facility includes 28 cells, furnished with only a toilet, a sink and a small table, where guests can spend time alone, thinking about life and enjoying private thinking periods. Moreover, guests can also join group thinking periods in the hall, where they are given instructions on how to free themselves from what Mr. Kwon calls the \"inner prison\" to find inner peace.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, hundreds of stressed South Koreans are checking in at the stress-reduction facility to think about their lives and regain control of it. A two-night stay at \"Prison Inside Me\" costs 150,000 won ($146).\nMr. Kwon and his wife explained that at the beginning they had a different plan for the \"relaxation center,\" and imagined a longer stay for their guests, but, given that people weren't able to take more time off, they had to reduce the length of stays to just two days.\nPark Woo-sub, a guest at \"Prison...\nWhat is the main idea of the passage?\nA) Many South Koreans voluntarily go to \"prison\" to reduce stress.\nB) Many South Koreans can hardly bear the stress of daily life.\nC) South Koreans should spend more time alone thinking about life.\nD) South Koreans have found the best way to deal with everyday pressure.",

The government of Nepal is telling climbers they cannot leave rubbish on the trails  . Each climber will have to come down the mountain with at least 18 pounds of garbage. That's the average amount of rubbish a climber leaves behind on Everest.\nOfficials say climbers are responsible for their own rubbish. \"We are not asking climbers to pick up rubbish left by someone else,\" said Maddhu Sudan Burlakoti, who works for the Nepal Tourism Ministry. \"We just want them to bring back what they took up.\"\nMore than 4,000 people have reached the 29,035-foot mountain top in the past 60 years. Leaving rubbish along the way helps climbers keep their bags light so they have energy to reach the top. \"The rubbish problem in Mount Everest is not new,\" Burlakoti says. \"When the people started to climb the mountain, they started to leave their garbage there.\" They have left behind cans, tents, food wrappers, and equipment. Last year, climbers carried down a total of four tons of rubbish.\nThe new rule came into effect in April of 2014. To make sure it is followed, climbers will have to deposit money before the climb. Once they climb back down the mountain, officials will check climbers at a return camp to make sure they have the required 18 pounds of rubbish. If they do, their money will be returned to them. If they do not, climbers will not receive their deposit and they will not be given a permit the next time they want to climb Everest.\nThe goal is to make sure no more litter will be left on Everest, which has earned the nickname   the World's Highest Dustbin. \"As we offer Mount Everest to all the people of the world they should take responsibility to clean it,\" Burlakoti says, \"After seeing the results from this, we will extend this rule to other mountains also.\"\nQuestion: Why was a new rule made?\nOptions: A: The rubbish problem there suddenly became serious.\nB: Mount Everest was considered to be a big dustbin.\nC: Climbers produced four tons of rubbish last year.\nD: The number of climbers there was beyond control.",

But a report by a Florida newspaper says that reusable grocery bags sold by some supermarkets contain high levels of lead . Lead is a metal that can be harmful to humans, especially young children. Now, Senator Charles Schumer is asking the US government to investigate  the use of lead in reusable shopping bags.\n\"When our families go to the grocery store looking for safe and healthy foods to feed their kids, the last thing they should have to worry about is poisonous bags.\" Schumer said, \"A quick investigation will allow everyone to make informed, timely decisions.\" Schumer added.\nLead in the bags is not likely to rub off on food. But over time, paint on the bags can chip and the bags can wear out. When this happens, lead can be released .\nThe Tampa Tribune newspaper said certain bags sold at Publix and Winn-Dixie supermarkets had lead levels that were a concern  to health officials. The affected bags were found in Florida. But Publix has more than 1,000 stores in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Sough Carolina and Tennessee. Publix says that all of its bags are under current laws about lead content, but that they have asked the makers of the bags to reduce the lead levels in the product.\nThe bags with the highest levels of lead had fancy designs and many pictures. Plain reusable bags without decoration were found to contain little lead. Consumers worried about lead levels in reusable bags can change to cloth or string bags. Paper bags are also a good choice, since paper can be recycled .\nSince 2007, Publix supermarkets have sold more than 13 million reusable bags. The store says because shoppers have made the change to reusable bags, it has saved more than 1 billion paper and plastics bags.\nQuestion: From Schumer's words we can learn that   _  .\nOptions: A: reusable bags do little harm to kids' health\nB: people have shown much concern for the reusable bags\nC: people will be informed of the facts about the reusable bags\nD: people should refuse to buy things from supermarkets",

There was actually more crust than filling. Often these pies were made from fowl ( ) and the fowl's legs were left to hang over the side of the dish and used as handles.

Yet most of us, myself included, tend to stuff as much as possible into whatever room is available-closets, schedules, budgets, relationships, and even the mind itself.\nHowever, some people know how to avoid overstuffing their life. For example, in Australia, it seemed that most people there operated at about 85% of their capacity ,unlike Americans pushing as close to 100% as possible. So when you run into Australians you know in the street, they have time to hang out and talk with you.\nRemember the cup: its value is in the space, the emptiness it holds. How to empty your \"cup\"?\nBe mindful of the element of space, openness , and emptiness  in your life. This includes room in a drawer, the volume of air in a kitchen, and open-mindedness in a friend. Sometimes you're just stuck with a big bucket of tasks yet to do. But at least empty the bucket faster than you fill it with new tasks. Put some space between finishing one thing and staring another. For example, after sending one email, take a breath before replying to another one. Drop the stuff you can no longer afford to _ around. At sea level, you can run with a brick in your backpack, but if you're hiking on a mountain, that brick has got to go.\nQuestion: What would be the best title for the passage?\n- The art of life.\n- Value every minute\n- The art of drinking tea\n- Empty your\"cup\"at times",

But that night she had a dream...\nShe found herself in a large cave, surrounded by gray bundles   of all shapes and sizes. Walking toward her was a woman with flowing long white hair.\n\"Who are you?\" asked the dreamer, \"and what is this place?\"\n\"This is the cave of bundles of troubles and I am the keeper of the cave.\"\n\"Bundles of troubles?\"\n\"Yes,\" the keeper explained, \"each person who walks on the earth carries a bundle of troubles on their left shoulder.\" The dreamer turned to look and there was a gray bundle on her left shoulder--it had been there all the time and she never noticed!\n\"If you wish,\" the keeper continued,\" you can take your bundle down and exchange it for another.\"\n\"Really?\" The woman lowered the bundle from her left shoulder.

It was taken down to make room for a new stadium. The blast  from the falling building caused the earth to shake as if an earthquake had happened \n \n      Scientists placed more than 200 earthquake recorders in the earth to measure the movement. They found which parts of the city shook the most. This information helped them know which parts of the city would be damaged in a real earthquake at an early time. \n      A real earthquake happened on February 28, 2001 in Seattle. The Nisqually earthquake was 6.8 on the Richter scale(6.8). It damaged the same parts of Seattle that scientists had predicted  from the pulling down of the Kingdome. It was a plate quake. It started deep in the earth, 37 miles below the surface on the Juan de Fuca Plate. Sometimes, huge plates under the earth cause earthquakes when the plates move against each other suddenly. \n       Scientists have learned that deep earthquakes have very few aftershocks . The Nisqually earthquake had only 4 ones. Another earthquake in California that was close to the surface had over 120 aftershocks. Scientists do not know why the deep earthquakes have fewer aftershocks. \n \n      Scientists plan to blast in the ground near Seattle with the purpose of testing the plate. The shockwaves from the blast will jump off the plate and give them an idea of where the plate is and how it is moving. This will give them more information in case another real earthquake hits the area.\nQuestion: According to the passage,   _   have the most aftershocks\nOptions: A: blast earthquakes\nB: earthquakes close to the surface\nC: deep earthquakes\nD: earthquakes more than 6.8 Richter scale",

        "Dear Ms. Wang,\nI am writing to inform you of some arrangements about my composition course and Latin course next year.\nI've decided to re-establish the 5-paragraph essay as the goal for the composition course. I interviewed some of my former students and they all agreed that being able to write critically and continuouslywas important to them.\nSo next academic year, Term 1 will be like always: sentences to paragraphing. And Term 2 will work toward the 5-paragraph essay. The final 3 weeks of Term 2 will be reserved tointroduce writing for TOEFL and CEE. By that time, if the students have done their job correctly, then they should be able to write quite well.\nAs for the Latin course, I will post notices around campus next week so that the students will understand what's on offer before I actually introduce the course. A number of students already emailed me about the course.\nI am sure you don't understand what a big deal our opening this program at our school is. People around the world are interested in what we plan to do. There are many rewards available to the students who succeed in the course. Please share what I have said with the administration. I want them to understand the importance of this course. The reason I have contacted these colleagues (actually Oxford contacted me) isthatI have confidence in our students and in myself. I know that when those professors meet our students and hear them speaking and reading Latin, they are going to be amazed. It will open all sorts of doors for students that they never even thought of knocking on.\nWell, that's it for now. I'll see you soon.\nYours,\nEdward Johnson\nWhy does Edward write this letter?\nA) To seek assistance from the administration.\nB) To inform the school of his course plans.\nC) To show his achievements in Latin.\nD) To apply for the teaching position.",

        "In 1992, when Xi Jinping worked in Fuzhou, he came across a newspaper report about \"My Guling,\" written by a Chinese student studying in the United States.\nThe report described an American couple who tried in vain to revisit a southern Chinese town called Guling, where the husband, Milton Gardner, had spent 10 years of his childhood before moving back to the United States in 1911.\nGardner, who later became a professor of physics at the University of California, had been longing to revisit Guling since 1979 when the diplomatic ties between China and the US were set up. But he had never made the trip due to his failing health.\nAccording to the newspaper, Gardner kept uttering  \"Kuling, Kuling\" in the final hours of his life.\nAfter he passed away, his wife Elizabeth Gardner decided to carry out the dying wish of her husband and since then made several trips to China in an attempt to find the small town that her husband had so much affection about. Her efforts ended in vain as she had few clues about the exact spot of the town. But a Chinese student lodging at the Gardners' recognized the small town as Guling near Fuzhou City from postmarks on some old mails of late Mr. Gardner. The student wrote an article about Gardners' story and sent it to the People's Daily, one of the major newspapers in China.\n\"After I read the story, I immediately contacted Mrs. Gardner through the departments concerned and invited her to visit Guling,\" Xi told the media. Thanks to Xi's arrangement, Mrs. Gardner finally arrived at Guling in August 1992. She met there with nine childhood friends of her husband, all of whom were over 90 years old at that time.\nIt was a happy occasion for Mrs. Gardner, who was later awarded the honorary citizenship of Fuzhou City, Xi recalled.\n\"She said that she would value this bond of friendship between her husband and the people of China, because after seeing for herself the beautiful Guling and the warmth and goodwill of the Chinese people, she now understood why her husband had been so deeply attached...\nWhat can we infer from the passage?\nA) Mr. and Mrs. Gardner were brought up in a southern Chinese town.\nB) The name of the town changed shortly after Milton Gardner left.\nC) Guling might have originally been pronounced as Kuling in English.\nD) Mrs. Gardner knew exactly where the small town lay in south China.",

The robbing of the three ships Sunday was about 600 miles outside the normal operation area for the international force, said a spokesman.\nThe spokesman said the attack so far out at sea was a clear sign that the international patrols against pirates were having a \"marked effect on pirate activity in the area\".\n\"Once they start attacking that far out, you're not even really talking about the Somali basin or areas of water that have any connection with Somalia,\" said an officer, Roger Middleton. \"Once you're that far out, it's just the Indian Ocean, and it means you're looking at trade going from the Gulf to Asia, from Asia to South Africa. \"\n\"This is the farthest robbing to date. They are now operating near the Maldives and India,\" said another officer.\nThe three ships--the MV Prantalay 11, 12, and l 4--had 77 members on board in total. All of them are Thai, the spokesman said. Before the Sunday robbing, pirates held l l ships and 228 sailors.\nPirates have increased attacks over the past year in hopes. of catching more dollar payments.

In the most populous city, Sydney, they've managed to use less water in 2007 than in 1974, even though the city grew by l. 2 million souls in this period.\nAcross the country nearly 20% of all households have water tanks.That would probably be due, in large part, to the various state governments offering generous\n. In NSW, for example, where 24,000 households have taken up the offer, you can get $1,500 AUD back if you fix a 7,000 + litre tank and have it attached into your toilet and washing machine.\nCreywater use has taken off too. The Australian Bureau of Statistics suggest that it's now the second most common source of water in Australia, with over half of the country's homes reusing water from their washing machines, showers and baths. The state of Victoria leads with 70% using greywater, and Queensland, coming close behind with 63%.\nUp in the northern state of.Queensland, some of their dams have been below 20%. Sydney's main dam is only at 56% of its potential capacity.\nThe country's ongoing drought  has seen more than 95% of the length of the Murray- Darling Basin ( the two major river systems that supply the nation's  'food basket' ) regarded as ' degraded',  Supply of water has become such an issue that hydro-electric power  output has dropped 7% in a recent 9 year period for the states of NSW, Victoria and Tasmania.Not good for promoting our uptake understanding of renewable energy in these climate changing times.But at least the message is getting through about making every drop count.",

Cats don't want something pushed down their throats, and they'll fight with all their strength to prevent it. In fact, it's amazing how powerful their small bodies can be.\nThe easiest way of pilling a cat is to press the pill into powder. Then mix the powder with a small amount of wet food. If your cat usually eats dry food, she will probably view the wet food as a treat and eat it up.\nIf your cat won't eat the wet food that contains the pill or if she is too ill to eat, you can get a \"pill gun\". There are some basic instructions. Getting your cat's mouth to open is going to be the most difficult part. First, be sure the pill is in a handy place. Then you can put your cat on a bookshelf with her bottom in a corner or you can put her on your lap firmly tied. Have your cat facing to the right if you're right-handed. With your left hand, hold your cat at the cheekbones, putting your palm   at the top of her head. Keeping your finger off the trigger  , with your right hand, Insert the pill gun until the pill is positioned over the tongue and open throat Be sure to give your cat a treat directly after giving the pill.\nIf you don't feel comfortable using a pill gun, you can try giving the pill by hand. Push your cat's head backwards just far enough so that her nose is pointing towards the ceiling. At this point, most cats will slightly open their mouths. With the little finger or ring finger of the hand holding the pill, open the bottom jaw a little more. You may need to hold her top jaw with your other hand while doing this. Aim straight and lightly throw the pill or drop it. Most cats will then swallow the pill.\nQuestion: Using a \"pill gun\", you had better hold your cat   _   if you're left-handed.\nOptions: A: facing to the right\nB: with your right hand\nC: at the head\nD: on your lap firmly",

As a student on a budget, I couldn't afford the 30 pounds (around 300 yuan) fare for a taxi. Even a bus was one pound and 20 pence (about 12 yuan) for a single ticket. I didn't need to travel this way anyway. I had Mabel-- my London bike.\n     When I moved to Beijing, like every foreigner, I was delighted to discover I could take a cab for cheaper than a single journey on the subway. But something was wrong. I missed Mabel. That was when I met Mandarin Mabel also known as Mandy, my Beijing bike.\n      In many ways, Beijing is made for: It is a flat, easy land compared with hilly London. The cycling city's north/south/east/west square structure is also easier to travel than London's unplanned, twisting streets.\n     However, Beijing comes completely with its own dangers. The rules of the road are\nflexible. Bikes, cars, passers-by all float up and down ways in both directions.\n     Compared with London's terrible cycle paths, in Beijing, every road has huge, wide cycle ways. But cars, taxis and motorbikes see no reason why they shouldn't use the cycle ways as a shortcut, and why they shouldn't announce you to get out of their way when they do.\n      Beijing traffic is more good-natured. In London, the road is an active war. People shout, quarrel and beat on each other's windows. In Beijing zone, drivers never get actively angry. In fact, often they ignore cyclists. Obviously that means it's up to the cyclists to see them.\n     Mandy is a tree Beijing bike. It is nearly broken, it makes loud noises every time you ride on it, and I have had to make several emergency repair stops for it.\n     But cycling round Beijing on a sunny day is a joy. It is just me, Mandy and the city.\nQuestion: What does the author think of cycling around Beijing?\nOptions: A: The city's twisting streets make it hard for the rider to find the way.\nB: Cars, taxis and motorbikes on the cycle lane pose a threat to cyclists.\nC: With the flat land and wide cycle lanes, it's safer to cycle in Beijing than in London.\nD: Cycling in Bejing is safe because of its flexible rules.",

        "Article: As summer comes near, many children are really happy to forget about school for a few months. However, they might be taking that goal too seriously. Studies have found that children often forget between one and three months' worth of school learning during the summer months. Spelling and math abilities drop off the most, while reading is not really influenced by the time off. The main reason for this is because most children sometimes read outside of the classroom, whether newspapers, magazines, books, or video game guides. However, their math and spelling skills only get exercised in the school setting.\nThe first purpose of summer holidays was to let farm children have time off to help work in the fields during the growing season, but this reason is no longer a good one since fewer kids actually work on farms today. Some cities in the United States, such as Los Angeles, have moved to a year-round school timetable, which may help reduce the loss of school skills that happens during the long summer holiday. To improve skills and to keep a good level of preparation, headmasters suggest trips to museums, summer camps, holidays with educational value, and visits to libraries to keep kids interested throughout the summer.\nThere are other educational systems that provide holidays while still keeping students' skills up to date. For example, in Japan, students attend class for seven weeks in a row, followed by two weeks of holiday. This continues the whole year. In Italy, students attend class six days per week, but finish at 1: 30 pm each day, so that school does not run their life the way that it does in America, where students attend high school from 7: 45 am until 3: 00 pm each weekday. In areas where there are not enough classrooms--in Afghanistan or Somalia, for example--older students attend classes in the morning while the younger kids go to school in the afternoon.\nHeadmasters fear that the three-month summer holiday stops the flow of learning. Just as students become used to new math problems or new ideas...\nQuestion: What can we infer from the passage?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Students love holidays and get their mind off learning in holidays.\"?",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\nArticle: \"Hypotheses ,\" said Medawarin 1964, \"are imaginative and inspirational in character\"; they are \"adventures of the mind\". He was arguing in favour of the position taken by Karl Popper that the nature of scientific method is hypothetico-deductive and not, as is generally believed, inductive.\nThe myth  of scientific method is that it is inductive: that the formulation of scientific theory starts with the basic, raw evidence of the senses -- simple, fair, unprejudiced observation. Out of these sensory data -- commonly referred to as \"facts\" -- generalisations   will form. The myth is that from a disorderly collection of factual information an orderly, relevant theory will somehow come out. However, the starting point of induction is an impossible one.\nThere is no such thing as an unprejudiced observation. Every act of observation we make is a function of what we have seen or otherwise experienced in the past. All scientific work of an experimental or exploratory nature starts with some expectation about the outcome. This expectation is a hypothesis. Hypotheses provide the motivation for the inquiry and influence the method. It is in the light of an expectation that some observations are held to be relevant and some irrelevant, that one method is chosen and others abandoned, that some experiments are conducted and others are not.\nHypotheses arise by guesswork, or by inspiration, but having been started they can and must be tested thoroughly, using the appropriate method. If the predictions you make as a result of deducing certain consequences from your hypothesis are not shown to be correct then you abandon or adjust your hypothesis. If the predictions turn out to be correct then your hypothesis has been supported and may be kept until such time as some further test shows it not to be correct. Once you have arrived at your hypothesis, which is a product of your imagination, you then move on to a strictly logical and thorough process, based upon deductive argument -- therefore the term \"hypothetico-deductive\".\nSo...\nOptions:\nA Generalisations of Scientific Theory\nB Hypotheses of Scientific Research.\nC The Psychological Behaviour\nD The Scientific Method\nAnswer:\nD The Scientific Method\nQuestion:",

South Korea was still in second place, though. Britain was at number 6.\nIn Korea the school day is long--typically 7 or 8 hours, followed by hours of private tutoring in the evenings. _ leaves Korean students so tired, they sometimes fall asleep in class next day. Worries about the effects of late night cramming  led the government to force cramming schools to close by 10 p.m. Finnish children spend the least time in class in the developed world, often finishing just after lunch, with about one hour of homework a day. Private tuition is uncommon. The British and American school day is quite long in comparison, around 6 hours, and secondary school pupils do 2 or 3 hours of selfstudy a night.\nThe Korean education system, like many in Asia, is intensely competitive, with students even competing to get into the best cramming schools, to help them get ahead. Finnish education is far less cutthroat. Classes are all mixed ability, and there are no league tables. British schools again occupy the middle ground, with quite high levels of competition for places at university, and schools and universities battling to come top of league tables for everything from exam results to student satisfaction. Korea and Finland both do well, yet their education systems are so different.\nHowever, there are some similarities between Korea and Finland. In those countries, teachers have high status in society, and education is very highly valued. Those attitudes can't change quickly. But it can be done. They might be the star pupils now, but until the 1970s, Finland's education system was poor. Their thoroughly different approach to schooling has taken them to the top in just a generation.\nQuestion: According to the text, we think in Korea   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"students spend more time in studying\"?",

The moneylender, who was old and ugly, fancied the businessman's beautiful daughter. So he proposed a bargain.\nThe moneylender told them that he would put a black pebble and a white pebble into an empty bag. The girl would then have to pick one pebble from the bag. If she picked the black pebble, she would become the moneylender's wife and he would _ her father's debt. If she picked the white pebble, she need not marry him and her father's debt would still be forgiven. But if she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown into jail.\nThey were standing on a pebble-strewn path. As they talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles. The sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two black pebbles and put them into the bag. He then asked the girl to pick a pebble from the bag. No doubt she was caught in a dilemma.\nWhat would you have done if you were the girl? Careful analysis would produce three possibilities:\n1.The girl should refuse to take a pebble.\n2.The girl should know that there were two black pebbles in the bag and expose the money-lender as a cheat.\n3.The girl should pick a black pebble and sacrifice herself in order to save her father from his debt and imprisonment.\nThe above story is used with the hope that it will make us appreciate the difference between lateral  and logical thinking.\nRead on...\nThe girl put her hand into the moneybag and drew out a pebble. Without looking at it, she fumbled and let it fall onto the pebble-strewn path where it immediately became lost among all the other pebbles. \"Oh, how clumsy of me!\" she said. \"But never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.\" Since the remaining pebble is black, it must be assumed that she had picked the white one.

In that age group, the WHO said, half of the people in rich and middle-income countries were exposed to unsafe sound levels from personal audio devices. Meanwhile 40% were exposed to damaging levels of sound from clubs and bars.\nThe proportion of US teenagers with hearing loss went from 3.5% in 1994 to 5.3% in 2006.\n\"What we're trying to do is raise awareness of the problem that is not talked about enough, but has the potential to do a lot of damage that can be easily prevented,\" said Dr Etienne Krug, the WHO's director for injury prevention.\nThe full report argued: \"While it is important to keep the volume down, limiting the use of personal audio devices to less than one hour a day would do much to reduce noise exposure.\"\nDr Krug said: \"That's a rough recommendation, it is not by the minute, to give an idea to those spending 10 hours a day listening to an mp3-player.

She dug into a box and pulled out a baseball card. She stopped for a moment and admired the picture. \"Red Stocking B. B. Club of Cincinnatti,\" the card read, under the reddish brown color photo of ten men with their socks pulled up to their knees.\nAs a collector and seller, it's her job to spot old items that might have value today. It's what Bernice,72, and her husband, Al Gallego, 80, have been doing since 1974 at their California antique store.\nThis card, she figured, was worth selling on eBay. She took a picture, wrote a description and put it up for auction.She put a $10 price tag on it, deciding against $15 because it would have cost her an extra 20 cents. Later that night she got a few odd inquiries---someone wanting to know whether the card was real, someone wanting her to end the caution and sell him the card immediately.\nThe card is actually 139 years old. Sports card collectors call the find \"extremely rare\" and estimate the card could\nfive, or perhaps, six figures at caution.\nJust like that, Bernice is the least likely character ever for a rare-baseball card story. \"I didn't even know baseball existed that far back,\" Gallego says, \"I don't think that I've ever been to a baseball game.\" The theory is that the card came out of a storage space they bought a few years back. It is not uncommon in their line of work to buy the entire contents of storage units for around $200.\nWhen she met with card trader Rick Mirigian, she found out what the card was-----an 1869 advertisement with a picture of the first professional baseball team, the Cincinnatti Red Stocking.\n\"When I came to meet her and she took it out of a sandwich bag and she was smoking a cigarette, I almost fainted,\" Mirigian says. \" They've uncovered a piece of history that few people will ever be able to imagine.

You really only need to look at our own solar system or the Earth at certain periods in its own history to appreciate that most places are much worse and much less suitable for life than our mild, watery globe.\nSo far, space scientists have discovered about seventy planets outside the solar. But it appears that if you wish to have a planet suitable for life, you just have to be very lucky, and the more advanced the life is, the luckier you'll have to be. I'm by no means a space observer, but I can recognize some particularly fortunate breaks we've had on the Earth. For example:\nWe are, to a degree, at the right distance from the perfect type of star, the one that is big enough to radiate a huge amount of energy, but not so big as to bum itself out quickly. Had our sun been ten times as huge, it would have burnt out completely after only ten million years, instead of ten billion and surely we would not exist. Too near, everything on the Earth would have boiled and withered away; any further, everything would have frozen over.\nThe universe is a surprising place, and our existence within it is a wonder. If a long and unimaginably complex sequence of events dating back 4.6 billion years or so hadn't happened in a particular manner at a particular time --if, to take just one example, the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out by a meteor --we might still be a few centimeters long, with whisker  and a tail, and you'll be reading this in a cave somewhere.\nOptions:\nA No Life Exists out of the Earth\nB Seventy Planets Discovered\nC A Place Full of Wonders\nD Perfect Conditions for Life\nAnswer:\nA No Life Exists out of the Earth\nQuestion:",

While the characteristics of friendship might vary from one country to another, people from all cultures not only enjoy friends but need them.\nMany studies have shown that teenagers who have no friends often suffer from psychological disorders. It has been shown that teenagers, perhaps more than any other age group, need companionship and a sense of belonging. The negative consequences of loneliness have also been observed among the elderly. The death of a spouse often leaves a widow or a widower totally bereft  . If, however, they are surrounded by friends and relatives and if they are able to articulate  their feelings, they are more likely to recover from their grief.\n\"No man is an island.\" In other words, we are all parts of society. We all need the love, admiration, respect and moral support of other people. If we are fortunate, our friends will provide us with all of these necessary aspects of life.\nAs most people observe, there are many levels of friendship. The degree or intensity of friendship varies depending on the personality of the individuals involved and the context of the relationships. Extroverts   enjoy being surrounded by many people whereas introverts are perhaps content with fewer but more intense friendships.\nEveryone is not equally open with all their friends. The degree of intimacy   is determined by many factors. Close friends can be formed at any stage in one's life but they are usually very rare.

Researchers have been studying green tea's effect on everything from cholesterol   to the risk of certain cancers, with mixed results so far.\nThey found those who drank the most green tea were the least likely to develop \"functional disability\", or problems with daily activities or basic needs, such as dressing or bathing.\nSpecifically, almost 13 percent of adults who drank less than a cup of green tea per day became functionally disabled, compared with just over 7 percent of people who drank at least five cups a day.\nThe study did not prove that green tea alone kept people agile as they grew older. Green-tea lovers generally had healthier diets, including more fish, vegetables and fruit, as well as more education, lower smoking rates, fewer heart attacks and strokes, and greater mental sharpness. They also tended to be more socially active and have more friends and family to rely on. But even with those factors accounted for, green tea itself was tied to a lower disability risk, the researchers said.\nPeople who drank at least five cups a day were one-third less likely to develop disabilities than those who had less than a cup per day. Those people who averaged three or four cups a day had a 25 percent lower risk.\nAlthough it's not clear how green tea might offer a buffer   against disability, Tomata's team did note that one recent study found green tea extracts   seem to increase leg muscle strength in older women.\nWhile green tea and its extracts are considered safe in small amounts, they do contain caffeine and small amounts of vitamin K, which means it could affect drugs that prevent blood clotting  .",

He appeared even weaker than the day before.\n\"How are you feeling, Dad?\" I asked. \"Can I do anything for you?\"\nHe tried to speak, but he couldn't make out a word.\n\"I'm sorry, but I can't understand you,\" I said.\nWith great difficulty he said, \"I love you.\"\nWe don't learn courage from heroes on the evening news. We learn true courage from watching ordinary people rise above hopeless situations. In many ways my father was a strict, uncommunicative man. He found it difficult to show emotion. The bravest thing I ever saw him do was overcome that barrier to open his heart to his son and family at the end of his life.",

        "When I was watching a sports event yesterday, I met with an amazing sight. It was not a gold medal, or a world record broken, but a show of pure courage and determination.\nThe event was swimming. I watched a man dive off the blocks and knew right away that something was wrong. I'm not an expert swimmer, but I can tell a good dive from a poor one, and this was not exactly medal quality. When he resurfaced, it was evident that the man was not out for gold -- his arms were waving in an attempt at freestyle.\nI heard the crowd begin to laugh at this poor man who was clearly having a hard time. Finally he made his turn to start back. It was pitiful. He made a few desperate strokes   and you could tell he was worn out. But in those few awkward strokes, the crowd changed. No longer were they laughing, but beginning to cheer. Some even began to stand and yell things like, \"Come on, you can do it!\" He did. The crowd went wild.\nJust a short year ago, he had never even swum, let alone race. His country had been invited to take part in the event. Even though he recorded the slowest time, this man gave more heart than any of the other competitors--a man that gave his all, knowing that he had no chance but to compete because of the spirit of the games.\nThe author's attitude towards the swimmer is that of   _  .\nA) tolerance\nB) disappointment\nC) carelessness\nD) admiration",

Posting too much personal information for those millions of cyber eyes to see can cause some big problems and can even invite a threat to your life.\nAs Mary learned, not everyone on the Internet is who he or she says they are. Adults will sometimes pose as other teens, posting fake photos and nice messages to gain trust. They use their fake identity to access the personal information of others, such as home address, phone number, or school name.\n\"That's not the most common scenario \", says David Finkelhor, a sociology professor at the University of New Hampshire. \"Only 3 percent of teens aged 10 to 18 who use the Internet report being asked to meet offline. But the danger is real.\nSafety measures\nMary's My Space profile is set to \"private\", which means that only the people she adds under the \"friend\" category can access her page. She also doesn't have any pictures of herself on her site. The only self-identifying material she has posted is her name, grade, and a list of hobbies.\n\"People can only add me if they know my last name or my e-mail, \"Mary says. \" I don't want random people to see my profile. I just go online to talk to my friends.\"\nStay safe and have fun online\nExperts say almost 90 percent of U.S. teens are online. But not everyone knows how to surf the Web in a smart way. With these tips, you can have fun, stay safe, and avoid embarrassment!\nPick a safe password. Make sure your password is something that other people won't be able to guess. Use numbers in between letters. \"spar123ky\" is better than \"sparky 123.\"\nPick a safe username. Make sure yours doesn't say too much about you, \"Happygirl13\" is better than \"AliceWaters13.\" Don't include your name, age, or where you are from. Never tell a stranger your name, school, address, age, birthday, phone number, or friends' names.\nQuestion: One of the safety measures mentioned in the passage is that   _  .\nOptions: A: one should not chat with strangers\nB: one should not post his or her photos online\nC: one should tell his parents about strange information\nD: one should keep his web as a secret",

        "Article: Scientists think it will be possible to record people's dreams and then interpret  them, according to a new report. They claim to have developed a system which allows them to record higher level brain activity. \nDr Moran Cerf told the journal Nature: \"We would like to read people's dreams.\" Previously the only way to access people's dreams is for psychologists to ask about them after the event and try to interpret them. Dr Cerf hopes to eventually compare people's memories of their dreams with an electronic visualization   of their brain activity. He told the BBC: \"There's no clear answer as to why humans dream. And one of the questions we would like to answer is when do we actually create this dream?\"\nThe scientist believes his latest research shows that certain neurons or individual brain cells are linked with specific objects or concepts . He found that a particular neuron lit up when a volunteer thought about Marilyn Monroe. If a database was built up identifying various neurons with concepts, objects and people it would allow them to \"read the subject's minds\", according to Dr Cerf.\nHowever, Dr Roderick Oner, a clinical psychologist and dream expert, said that this kind of visualization would be of limited help when it came to interpreting the \"complex dream narrative \". In addition to getting a detailed picture of individual neurons subjects had to have electrodes implanted deep in the brain using surgery.\nThe Nature researchers used data from patients who had electrodes implanted to monitor and treat them for brain seizures . However, Dr Cerf said he hoped that it would be possible at a later stage to monitor people without invasive surgery .He said it would be \"wonderful\" to be able to read the minds of coma patients who are unable to communicate.\nQuestion: From the text, we can know Dr Moran Cerf   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"hopes to read the minds of coma patients\"?",

        "Televisions were among the most talked about items at the 2013 International Consumer Electronics Show last week in Las Vegas, Nevada. Some employed the most advanced technology ever.\nSome of the TVs used a new technology called Organic Light Emitting Diodes, or OLED. They were thinner, lighter, offered better color1 and were brighter than traditional LEDs. Smart TVs this year were smarter. Many offered technology that let users have a more personalized experience. One such TV from the electronics company TCL uses sensors and voice recognition to determine who is watching. It then offers programming based on the specific user. Another TV from Panasonic offers a similar personalized user experience.\nIn addition to television technology, size also played a major part in CES 2013. Televisions varied in size from big to bigger, with at least two companies -- Samsung and HiSense -- exhibiting TVs measuring 110 inches.\nThe yearly Consumer Electronics Show is the biggest technology trade show in North America and one of the biggest in the world.\nGary Shapiro is president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, the group that organizes CES. He gave one of the keynote speeches on opening day.\n\"Now you know that CES is more than a trade show. It's a gathering of the brightest minds and the top leaders from many industries and those seeking a glimpse into the future.\"\nThat glimpse into the future included a look at digital health and fitness devices, which were also big at CES 2013. There were devices that track your activity and others that measure blood pressure, heart rate and weight. There was even a fork that tells you when you are eating too fast.\nCars, smart-phones, tablet computers and PCs also made news. And a 27-inch table computer drew quite a bit of attention.\nCEA President Gary Shapiro says there was much to see but not nearly enough time to see it all. \"You cannot see the show in the four days that you have. We have over 3200 different industries showing over 20,000 new products. It's  ly incredible.\"\nFrom the text, we can know that the TV from Panasonic   _  .\nA) is bigger than the others\nB) uses the technology of OLED\nC) offers a personalized experience\nD) can track your activity",

        "I'm a speed reader. Have been since I was a teen. Mother worked for the continuing education department of a university, and they were offering a class on speed reading and needed one more person to fill out the class. I became that one person.\nThe class met for only an hour or two for a few weeks, but when the goal of a class is speed, you don't need to meet for long. The instructor said to make our eyes go across the lines of words as fast as they could and not to be concerned about what the words meant. I read Animal Farm in 10 ten minutes. Cover to cover. The instructor asked what the book was about. I said I didn't know, but if I had to guess I'd say it was about animals on a farm. He looked displeased.\nI've been speed reading ever since. I can't stop and I can't slow down. Today, for example, I plan on reading Churchill's History of the English Speaking Peoples over lunch. I hope it's more memorable than Animal Farm.\nAs a result of all this speed-reading, I often experience a delay between what I think I read and what something actually says.\nThe other day I passed by a mall with a large sign that said \"Auto Theft Sale\". I thought how efficient it was for auto thieves to simply sell all the stole cars in a big tent at the mall. A half-mile later it dawned on me that the sign had said \"Auto Tent Sale\".\nEvery time I drive through a construction zone, I gasp  . The sign says: \"Hit a Worker $10, 000 (about 62,000 yuan).\" It reads like they're offering a reward. Of course, it's not an offer. It's just that my eyes rarely take in the last line that says, \"Fine.\" It's a $10, 000 fine if you hit a worker. Someone really needs to rephrase that one.\nSpeed reading has bitten me on the backside more than once. Especially as a writer. Just ask any of my editors.\nThe author tends to prove that there is always a delay in her understanding after speed reading by   _  .\nA) making comparisons\nB) analyzing cause and effect\nC) giving examples\nD) drawing a conclusion",

I had the most wonderful childhood, and it's not because I had everything I wanted or because I was a cool kid. I have learned a lot about parenting from what my parents did. Here are a few gems   that I use now or plan to use in the future with my two boys.\nHere's how a conversation often went when I was a kid. Usually it was around 4:30 p.m. I said, \"I'm hungry. Can I have a cookie?\" My mom answered, \"No. Have a banana.\" \"I don't want a banana.\" \"Then you're not hungry.\" Sometimes I was angry about it, but I knew that was good for me. Thanks mom for not letting me eat junk food  . Now I agree with my mother and I have this same conversation with my three-year-old son. I hope it helps him form healthy diet habits.\nI know many of us heard this as children. \"If everyone jumped off a bridge, would you do it, too?\" If our kids asked for something just because everyone else had it or was doing it, we often got this response. It was the perfect response, and we soon learned not to ask for things because everyone else had it, but because it was something we wanted.\nI will always be thankful that my parents let us try the things that interested us, not the things they wanted to push us into. This helped me try swimming, dance, and the piano before second grade. I found a love -- singing -- and kept up with that through my college years.

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: The following are letters to the editor of a school newspaper.              \nDear editor,\nI'd like to express my opinion about grades. Students should be allowed to study without worrying about grades. Fortunately, most educators are becoming aware of the fact that students have different interests and abilities. I understand that grades are useful, but grades often limit creativity. Competing for better grades causes many students to turn down opportunities to pursue music, dramatics and sports. Grades force an arbitrary  standard of success on everyone. I do not demand as some extremists do, that grades be removed immediately. However, I do believe that less emphasis should be placed on grades. I hope that someday grades will become optional at Village High School. \nMagdalena Smith\nDrama Club \n \nDear editor,\nI'd like to say something about grades. Let's face the facts about grades. Grades perform three basic functions. First, grades motivate  students to work at their highest level of competence . Second, they act as a reward for hardworking students and as a punishment to students who do not work hard. Finally, grades are used as an effective standard by which to measure students' achievement. Good grades help students to get jobs and to get into university. I've spoken with a number of students who have jobs, and most of them say that they were hired primarily on the basis of their grades. My grades helped me land a part-time job and will help me get into university next year. I think grades are extremely important at Village High School. \nSimon Harper\nScience Club\nQuestion: Which of the following is not Magdalena Smith's opinion?\nOptions: A: Grades should not be used to measure a person's success.\nB: Students may give up the chance to learn music and sports for grades.\nC: Students' creativity may not be developed for grades.\nD: Grades should be taken away at once.",

Even if a student is not performing well, they can predict success. We are convinced that this ability, this gift, is evidence that they were \"called to teach\" . If the gift of sight is evidence, how greater must be the gift of touch. I have a story.\nI grew up in the fifties in a poor African American neighborhood in Stockton, California, that had neither sidewalks nor an elementary school. Each day, always in groups at our parents' insistence, my friends and I would leave home early enough to walk eight blocks to school and be in our seats when the bell rang. For four blocks, we walked on dusty roads. By the fifth block, we walked on sidewalks that led to lovely homes and to Fair Oaks Elementary School. It was at Fair Oaks, in a sixth grade English class, that I met Ms. Victoria Hunter, a teacher who had a huge influence on my life.\nDuring reading periods, she would walk around the room, stop at our desks, stand over us for a second or two, and then touch us. Without saying anything to us (nothing could break the silence of reading periods), she would place two fingers lightly on our throats and hold them there for seconds. I learned many years later when I was a student at Stanford University that teachers touch the throat of students to check for sub-vocalization  , which slows down the reading speed. I did not know at the time why Ms. Hunter was touching our throats, but I was a serious and respectful student and so, during silent reading period, I did what Ms. Hunter told us to do. I kept my eyes on the material I was reading and waited for her to place her fingers lightly on my throat.\nOne day, out of curiosity, I raised my head from my book -- though not high -- so that I could see Ms. Hunter, a white woman from Canada, moving up and down the rows, stopping at the desks of my classmates. I wanted to see how they reacted when she touched their throats. She walked past them. I was confused. Did she pass them by because...",

One way in which this works is by wearing different color1s of clothes.\nNormally when we are sad, we will wear dark color1ed clothes. Oppositely, when we are happy, we often choose to wear brightly color1ed clothes. The reason for this is that our choice of color1 mirrors is how we are feeling.\nThose who don't believe in the idea are often heard saying, \"if only this truly worked\". Well in reply to those people, there has been a lot of research into what happens to someone's feelings when they are asked to wear just one color1 of clothes. It has been proven that if we wear particular color1s of clothes they can change our feelings.\nSuppose we are feeling sad, if we wear black we may begin to feel worse. However, if we wear green, red or yellow, we may begin to feel better.\nEach color1 is said to have its own healing power.

They had met in an Eighth Street restaurant, and found their tastes in art, chicory salad and bishop sleeves so much in tune that the joint studio  resulted.

In all, 104 prisoners are to be released in four rounds over the coming months.\nIn the West Bank and Gaza , the mood was overexcited as hundreds of Palestinians welcomed the prisoners back home, after many had spent more than 20 years behind bars.\nCrowds of people rushed toward the 5 prisoners released to Gaza, raising them on their shoulders, waving Palestinian flags and dancing to music. Relatives held signs that read \"we will never forget our heroes.\" More than 2,000 people welcomed the 21 prisoners released to the West Bank, who were greeted at a ceremony by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah.\nHazem Shubair, thrown into prison in 1994 for the death of an Israeli according to the Israeli Prison Service, was over delighted upon his return to Gaza. \"I am speechless,\" he said. \"Thanks to God. God is greater than the aggressors (meaning Israel)\".\nAbbas said a final peace agreement with Israel was possible on the release of the prisoners. \"There will be no final agreement without the release of all the prisoners,\" he told the violent crowd.\nIsrael's Supreme Court   earlier refused an appeal that intended to cancel the prisoner release. An organization of bereaved   families behind the appeal has said it fears the prisoners, all in connection to the deaths of Israelis, will return to violence once freed.\nQuestion: Why did Israel free 26 Palestinian prisoners early Wednesday?\n- Because they would take part in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.\n- Because that was part of an agreement between Israel and Palestinians.\n- Because the current Israeli-Palestinian peace talks failed.\n- Because the peace talks had broken down since 2008.",

Background, described as family, education, and experience, proved his lowest score at 32nd.\nThis is the 5th time the institute has conducted the survey of U.S. presidents, which is done a year after a new president takes office. The first survey was done in 1982. \"Obviously, there's not great  _ to the poll since the Presidents have only been in office for one year,\" says the survey's co-director and statistician Douglas Lonnstrom. \"But it's a benchmark for us to see how they move.\"\nPresidents tend to rank around 20th while they are in office, and Obama is no exception. His actions over the next few years will decide if he stays roughly the same like Reagan--who moved from 16th to 20th, 22nd, 16th again, and finally to 18th this year--or like Bush, who fell from 23rd to 39th.\nFranklin D.

The standards may be changed ---- no examination is perfect ---- but to have no external tests or examinations would mean the end of equality and of standards. There are groups of people who oppose this view and who do not believe either in external examinations or in any controls in schools or on teachers. This would mean that everything would depend on luck since every pupil would depend on the efficiency, the ideal and the purpose of each teacher.\nWithout external examinations, employers will look for employees from the highly respected schools and from families known to them ---- a form of favoritism will replace equality. At the moment, the bright child from an ill-respected school can show certificates to prove he or she is suitable for a job, while the lack of a certificate shows the unsuitability of a dull child attending a well - respected school. This defense of excellence and opportunity would disappear if external examinations were taken away, and the bright child from a poor family would be a prisoner of his or her school's fame, unable to compete for employment with the child from the favored school.\nThe opponents of the examination system suggest that examinations are an evil force because they show differences between pupils. According to these people, there must be no special, different, academic class. They have even suggested that there should be no form of difference in sport or any other area: all jobs or posts should be filled by unsystematic selection.

However, these crowd-pleasers can have some damaging side effects.\nOnce a firework is set off, it only takes a couple of seconds before smoke, dust and harmful chemicals are let out into the atmosphere. The loud booming noises are caused by gunpowder. While the sounds may excite some people, they can be frightening to domestic and wild animals--as well as some humans.\nThe pretty colors you see are a result of more chemicals. Barium, added to make green, is known for its poisonous and radioactive qualities. Blue comes from copper compounds. Cadmium, lithium and lead--all found in fireworks--have been linked to diseases, such as allergies and skin rashes in both humans and animals. Acid rain has been linked to gases given off by fireworks, which sometimes go beyond the toxin  limits of the United States Clean Air Act.\nOnce all those chemicals come back down to the ground, they can cause problems too. Debris   from the fireworks falls to the ground, where animals can burn their paws or noses on piping hot pieces. Humans also are at risk of stepping on or picking up something sharp or hot. Meanwhile, debris that finds its way into waterways can damage animal habitats and water supply sources.\nInstead of setting off fireworks, try to come up with some new ways for fun. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n* Sky lanterns--a tradition that originated long ago in the most-populated Asian country.\n* Party crackers--a favorite in the United Kingdom--give you noise and surprises without the mess of fireworks. You can make your own or buy eco-friendly crackers.\n* Want noise excitement with less volume? Consider a fireworks sound recording beforehand or break out the party horns   and blow up a storm!\nQuestion: What is implied from the passage?\n- Gunpowder in fireworks makes loud booming noises.\n- It must be Indians who first started to hang sky lanterns.\n- Fireworks does less harm in the air than on the ground.\n- Fireworks can even break the balance of nature.",

The African development Bank is raising concerns over the shortage of health insurance and pensions  .\nThe African Development Bank says. \"Aging is highly linked with long-term physical and mental  disability and a number of long-term chronic   conditions.\"\n\"Africa is not well prepared to care for its aging population right now. And it needs to prepare for this fact.\" said Professor Mthuli Ncube. the African Development Bank's chief economist. African nations spend far less on healthcare than developed nations do _  about $26per person per year. Not so many countries have well developed medical aid plans for the elderly, whether they are privately provided plans or indeed government plans. If you look at the pension plans, you will find the pension industries are not well developed in some of the countries.\nProfessor Mthuli Ncube said African governments failed to take action on health insurance\nand pensions because they were busy with economic reforms.\nAnother challenge for Africa is the worsening of informal systems of social protection. That is cash and support from both the extended family and community sources.\n. The African Development Bank recommends governments help carry out health insurance and pension plans. Ncube said African governments didn't have to handle the health insurance burden alone. \"It is not only a must but also an opportunity for private companies to add their bit in this regard\", he said. The report also recommends that African governments consider providing ways of free health services. medications and long-term health care facilities for the elderly.\nQuestion: Which is not highly linked with the aging according to the passage?\nOptions: A: Long-term physical disability.\nB: Long-term mental disability.\nC: Long-term chronic illnesses.\nD: Long-term shortage of care and love.",

        "Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: Why College Is Not Home\nThe college years are supposed to be a time for important growth in autonomy  and the development of adult identity. However, now they are becoming an extended period of adolescence, during which many of today's students and are not shouldered with adult responsibilities.\nFor previous generations, college was decisive break from parental control; guidance and support needed help from people of the same age and from within. In the past two decades, however, continued connection with and dependence on family, thanks to cellphones, email and social media, have increased significantly. Some parents go so far as to help with coursework. Instead of promoting the idea of college as a _ from the shelter of the family to autonomy and adult responsibility, universities have given in to the idea that they should provide the same environment as that of the home.\nTo prepare for increased autonomy and responsibility, college needs to be a time of exploration and experimentation. This process involves \"trying on \" new ways of thinking about oneself both intellectually  and personally. While we should provide \"safe spaces\" within colleges, we must also make it safe to express opinions and challenge majority views. Intellectual growth and flexibility are fostered on debate and questioning.\nLearning to deal with the social world is equally important. Because a college community  differs from the family, many students will struggle to find a sense of belonging. If students rely on administrators to regulate their social behavior and thinking pattern, they are not facing the challenge of finding an identity within a larger and complex community.\nMoreover, the tendency for universities to monitor and shape student behavior runs up against another characteristic of young adults: the response to being controlled by their elders. If acceptable social behavior is too strictly defined  and controlled, the insensitive or aggressive behavior that administrators are seeking to minimize may actually be...\nQuestion: What's the author's attitude toward continued parental guidance to college students?\nAnswer:",

They are dying because they are losing a great deal of habitat due to human incursion and global warming.  They are dying because of starvation as well.  With the sea ice they depend on for survival shrinking, it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to find food.\nAn ecosystem is highly dependent on all of its parts, and removing even a single species can result in serious consequences.  Polar bears are at the top of the predators where they live.  They play an important part in the ecosystem.  They feed on seals, fish and deer.  Several other animals depend on the kill of polar bears.  The failure to save polar bears might result in loss of these predators.\nIn addition, all large predators perform a very important function in their habitat: helping to control the populations of other species.  When an animal group loses its natural predators, its population will rise rapidly, having a direct result in population decrease of other groups.  A huge boom in population of Arctic seals would have a direct effect on the prey  of seals, and could reduce numbers of certain types of fish.\nThis could also have a direct effect on humans, who might have to compete with Arctic seals for food supplies from fish. Lack of polar bears could eventually affect human food supply. Human beings shall save polar bears to ensure the food supply.\nThere is no doubt that we should save polar bears.  However, there is still another question: can they be saved? This is a matter that scientists debate because of rapid degradation of the polar bear' environment in recent years due to warming temperatures.  It is estimated that if the bears cannot adapt to changing climates, they might die out before the end of the 21stcentury, with about 50% of the animals disappearing by 2050. So time is running out!\nThere are some things that may help slow down global warming and help delay extinction of polar bears.  These include finding new energy sources...\nQuestion: If bears can't adapt to changing climates, we will probably have lost  _  by the middle of the 21stcentury.\nAnswer:",

The word rubbish could lose its meaning because everything which goes into the dumps would be made into something useful . Even the most dangerous and unpleasant wastes would provide energy if nothing else .\nThe latest project is to take a city of around half a million inhabitants and discover exactly what raw materials go into it and what go out . The aim is to find out how much of these raw materials could be provided if a plant for recycling waste were built just outside the city . This plant would recycle not only metal such as steel , lead and copper , but also paper and rubber as well .\nAnother new project is being set up to discover the best ways of sorting and separating the rubbish . When this project is complete , the rubbish will be processed like this : First , it will pass through sharp metal bars which will tear open the plastic bags in which rubbish is usually packed ; then it will pass through a powerful fan to separate the lightest elements from the heavy solids ; after that founders and rollers will break up everything that can be broken . Finally , the rubbish will pass under magnets  , which will remove the bits of iron and steel ; the rubber and plastic will then be sorted out in the final stage .\nThe first full-scale giant recycling plants are perhaps fifteen years away .

Soon doctors were finding similar cases all over the country and the world. The AIDS epidemic had officially begun. By 1983 it was clear that AIDS had spread around the world. More than twenty years later, AIDS has left twenty-six million dead and another forty million infected.  AIDS has become the worst medical disaster ever experienced by mankind.\nHundreds of young people between the ages of 20 and 45 died each week during the early years of the U.S. AIDS.

Unfortunately, the AIDS epidemic continues today in Africa and much of Asia, where antiretroviral treatment is not available and health care is far from enough. AIDS is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, and the No. 1 cause of death due to infectious disease.\nHIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was first separated in 1983 by a team at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. That discovery made it possible to develop a test for AIDS and trace back to victims who may have died before doctors were aware of the disease.\nHowever, scientists still don't know exactly how and where AIDS started.

In the 1920s, archaeologists discovered some prehistoric human bones there which changed people's view of China's history. They came from an unknown species of man and were the first evidence of human life in China thousands of years ago. The remains were three teeth!\nIn 1929, a complete skull was also discovered. Eventually, archaeologists found almost 200 items, including six skulls and more than 150 teeth. These discoveries proved the existence of a human species who lived in the area between 700,000 and 200,000 years ago. Four sites where Beijing Man and his relatives lived were discovered on the northern face of Longgushan. They lived in the caves in the area.\nHowever, the life span of Beijing Man was short. About 70% of the people probably died before the age of 14. Fewer than 5% lived to the age of 50. Ashes were found alongside the fossils which showed they had used fire for cooking food and also for light, warmth, and protection against wild animals. This is the earliest evidence of the use of fire anywhere in the world. They also made tools of bones and stones. Unfortunately, when Japan invaded China in 1937, excavations   at the Beijing Man Site stopped and most of the fossils disappeared, including a Beijing Man skull. After the People's Republic of China was established in 1949, the work started again.\nZhoukoudian was listed as a World Heritage Site in December 1987. It has not only given us important information about prehistoric Asian societies, but also provided amazing evidence about the process of evolution. Today, parts of the caves have been badly affected by rain. Some areas are almost completely covered in weeds, causing serious damage. Pollution from the nearby factories has also led to the problem. This is a very serious matter and the Chinese Academy of Sciences is trying to raise public awareness of protecting it.\nQuestion: Archaeologists   _  .\n- thought that the findings in Zhoukoudian are the first evidence of human life in Asia\n- thought that the findings in Zhoukoudian wouldn't change the history of China\n- discovered some prehistoric human bones in Zhoukoudian\n- thought that Zhoukoudian was a beautiful village",

You have become a talented and accomplished young woman. You should be as proud of yourself as we are.\nCollege will be the most important years in your life. It is in college that you will truly discover what learning is about. You often question \"what good is this course\". I encourage you to be inquisitive  , but I also want to tell you: \"Education is what you have left after all that is taught is forgotten.\" What I mean by that is -- the material taught isn't as important as you gaining the ability to learn a new subject, and the ability to analyze a new problem. \nDo your best in classes, but don't let pressure get to you. If you graduate and learn something in your four years, we would feel happy. Your Columbia degree will take you far, even if you don't graduate with honors. So please don't give yourself pressure. The only thing that matters is that you learned. The only measurement you should use is that you tried. \nMost importantly, make friends and be happy. College friends are often the best in life, because during college you are closer to them physically than to your family. Also, going through independence and adulthood is a natural bonding   experience. Pick a few friends and become really close to them -- pick the ones who are genuine and sincere to you. Don't worry about their hobbies, grades, looks, or even personalities. If you think you like someone, tell her. You have very little to lose. People are not perfect, so as long as they are genuine and sincere, trust them and be good to them. They will give back. This is my secret of success -- that I am genuine with people and trust them (unless they do something to lose my trust). \nCollege is the four years where you have:\n  *the greatest amount of free time\n  *the first chance to be independentk%s5$u\n  *the most flexibility to change\n  *the lowest risk for making mistakes\nSo please treasure...\nOptions:\nA Friends.\nB A parent and his or her daughter.\nC A teacher and a student.\nD Sisters.\nAnswer:\nB A parent and his or her daughter.\nQuestion:",

Because of this, developing more positive self talk is an important way to reduce stress in your life. You can help yourself maintain a positive frame of mind which will help with positive self talkby surrounding yourself with positive energy in your life. You can get that by adding some elements to your life.\nListening to music that not only has a pleasant melody, but an uplifting message, can be great for developing positive self talk. Have you ever had a song \"stuck in your head\" for a few hours or days, the lyrics   repeating themselves in your mind? If those lyrics were positive and inspirational, that would be a good thing. It's a much better mental soundtrack to have than a running stream of complaints, criticisms of self-limiting thoughts, or even songs that had more depressing or sad lyrics.\nBooks on strength, personal power, enlightenment, or self help can be good resources to help you change your outlook and the things you say to yourself. Rather than bringing habitual self-defeating thoughts, you can find yourself thinking of new can-do concepts when times get tough.\nOne of the most important ways you can get and keep positive energy in your life is with the company you keep. Do your friends uplift you, or bring you down? Are they critical, or approving? Ideal friendships provide support when you're down, fun when you're up, wisdom when you're lost. Good friends can inspire you to reach greater heights, and see your strengths even when you don't always. Pay attention to how your friends make you feel, and if they're less than supportive, start putting your energy and time toward people who are better suited to be your friends.\nIn addition, positive affirmations  can certainly change your self talk from negative to positive. Now, why not begin working positive affirmations into your life in some creative ways?\nQuestion: If you have something \"stuck in your head\", you probably   _  .\nAnswer:",

        "Can dogs help with OCD?\nYou might watch and laugh when your dog chases its tail because it looks cute. But did you know that, even though it might appear like a fun game, it could mean your pet is sick?\nResearchers have found that if a dog runs after its tail, chases cars and barks  at flies that are not there, it may have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD, ).\nIn fact, OCD is even more common among humans. The symptoms   are varied: some people check and recheck the locks before they go out; others are extremely afraid of germs   and have to wash their hands many times a day.\nEnglish soccer star David Beckham, for example, cannot stand odd numbers   of items in his fridge. So if he has three cans of drink he will throw one out, according to his wife Victoria.\nHoping to better understand OCD in humans, a team of scientists from the University of Helsinki, Finland, studied 368 dogs, including those that chase their tail for several hours daily or a few times a month, according to Sciencedaily.com. They also examined dogs that had never chased their tails. Scientists took the dogs' blood sample   and asked their owners some questions about their pets' daily life.\nFindings showed that among all kinds of dogs, bull terriers   and German shepherds   were likely to chase their tails, which led scientists to believe that genes   can cause OCD.\nDiet also plays a part. It was found that dogs that eat food with certain vitamins and minerals chased their tails less. \"Interestingly, there are indications   that vitamins and minerals are helpful in human OCD treatment,\" said researcher Katriina Tiira.\nMoreover, tail-chasing is often found among dogs that were separated from their mothers too early or ones that didn't receive enough care. They are also more likely to turn out to be shyer and more afraid of loud noises at a young age.\nThe study can help us understand the causes of OCD in humans. \"Dogs share the same environment with humans, and large animals are physiologically   close to humans,\" said Hannes Lohi, leader...\nAccording to the study, OCD   _  .\nA) will help dogs to become braver\nB) shows similar symptoms in dogs and humans\nC) is more common among dogs than among humans\nD) can be eased with the help of certain vitamins and minerals",

They help to build America's first transcontinental railroad between 1863 and 1869, connecting the East Coast with the West.\nPeople know little about the Chinese railroad workers and what happened to them after the project was finished. Stanford University in California wants to learn more about the lives of these men by reaching out to their families.\nBill Yee's ancestors came from southern China. He said, \"My great-great-grandfather came to America during the'gold rush'days and he returned to China as a wealthy man. And then my great-grandfather came to work on the railroad and died there.\"\nBut that did not stop his grandfather from coming to the US on false papers. He operated a laundry. Bill Yee's father continued to run the business and has never returned to China.\n\"Things were pretty bad in some parts of China in the 1860's. They came to America at all costs in order that they no longer had to bear hunger,\" Bill Yee said.\nShelley Fisher Fishkin is helping to direct the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project at Stanford University. She said, \"Many of the Chinese workers who came to work on the transcontinental and other railroads returned to China after their work was done and created families there. Some of them settled in America and created new families, but they had families who they left when they came here and they may have descendants in China.\"\nThere is a need to create a record of the object and spoken history from the families of the railroad workers.\n\"The US could not have become the modern industrial nation without the railroads. And the railroads would not have come together without the work of these Chinese workers,\" said Shelley Fisher Fishkin.\nQuestion: According to Shelley Fisher Fishkin,  _  .\n- the descendants of the Chinese railroad workers all live a good life\n- they expect to find all the descendants of the Chinese railroad workers\n- some Chinese railroad workers hope they can find their descendants in China\n- some Chinese railroad workers have descendants both in China and the US",

According to statistics, you are more than twice as likely to die of skin cancer as a woman, and nine times more likely to die of AIDS. Assuming you make it to the end of your natural term, about 78 years for men in Australia, you'll die on average five years before a woman.\nThere are many reasons for this--typically, men take more risks than women and are more likely to drink and smoke--but perhaps more importantly, men don't go to the doctor.\n\"Men aren't seeing doctors as often as they should,\" says Dr. Gullotta. \"This is particularly so for the over-40s, when diseases tend to strike.\"\nGullotta says a healthy man should visit the doctor every year or two. For those over 45, it should be at least once a year.\nTwo months ago Gullotta saw a 50-year-old man who had delayed doing anything about his smoker's cough for a year.\n\"When I finally saw him it had already spread and he has since died from lung cancer,\" he says. \"Earlier detection and treatment may not have cured him, but it would have prolonged his life.\"\nAccording to a recent survey, 95% of women aged between 15 and early 40s see a doctor once a year, compared to 70% of men in the same age group.\n\"A lot of men think they're undefeatable,\" Gullota says. \"They only come in when a friend drops dead on the golf course and they think, 'Geez, if it could happen to him, ...'\"\nThen there's the ostrich approach. \"Some men are scared of what might be there and would rather not know,\" says Dr. Ross Cartmill.\n\"Most men get their cars serviced more regularly than they service their bodies,\" Cartmill says. He believes most diseases that commonly affect men could be addressed by preventive check-ups.\nRegular check-ups for men would inevitably place strain on the public purse, Cartmill says. \"But prevention is cheaper in the long run than having to treat the diseases. Besides, the ultimate cost is far greater: it is called premature death.\"",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: Since IQ testing began a century ago, women have been as much as five points behind, leading psychologists to suggest genetic differences between the male and the female.\nThat gap has been narrowing in recent years and this year women have moved ahead.\nThe finding has been made by James Flynn, a world-famous expert on IQ tests. \"In the last 100 years, the IQ scores of both men and women have risen but women's have risen faster,\" said Flynn. \" This is a result of modernity. The complex modern world is making our brains adapt and raising our IQs.\"\nOne possible explanation is that women's lives have become more demanding as they multitask between raising a family and doing a job. Another might be that women have a slightly higher potential intelligence than men and are only now realizing it.\nFlynn also made the great discovery that scores in western countries increased by roughly three points a decade, which means people today get 30 more points than those living 100 years ago and that IQs can be improved.\nFlynn conducted new IQ tests in western European countries, America, Canada, New Zealand, Argentina and Estonia, which showed that the gap between men and women had become very small. In New Zealand, Estonia and Argentina, women scored slightly higher than men.\nMaybe because of this, many women have exchanged the role with their husband in family life. Helena Jamieson, 33, works a full-time job and her husband, Luke, 37, is a stay-at-home father. Helena said, \"I'm definitely the more intellectual person in the relationship and I'm at work full-time rising up the career ladder while he is raising our daughter.\"\nShe added, \"In the past, men would look down on me, thinking that I was a woman and not as smart as them. But today, things have changed. I think women probably always know secretly deep down that they are the more intelligent ones-but as the gentler sex, we were just quiet about it in the past and let men believe that they ruled the world.\"\nQuestion: The main idea of the passage is that_.\nOptions: A: wives now serve as breadwinners while husbands raise children\nB: people today are much smarter than those living 100 years ago\nC: in western countries, women scored higher than men in IQ tests\nD: women's IQ has risen faster and has even gone beyond men's",

Miller's father had moved to the USA from Austria-Hungary, drawn like so many others by the \"Great American Dream\". However, he experienced severe financial hardship when his family business was ruined in the Great Depression of the early 1930s.\nMiller's most famous play,Death of a Salesman,is a powerful attack on the American system, with its aggressive way of doing business and its insistence on money and social status as indicators of worth. In Willy Loman, the hero of the play, we see a man who has got into trouble with this system. Willy is \"burnt out\" and in the cruel world of business there is no room for sentiment: if he can't do the work, then he is no good to his employer, the Wagner Company, and he must go. Willy is painfully aware of this, and at a loss as to what to do with his lack of success. He refuses to face the fact that he has failed and kills himself in the end.\nWhen it was first staged in 1949, the play was greeted with enthusiastic reviews, and it won the Tony Award for Best Play, the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It was the first play to win all three of these major awards.\nMiller died of heart failure at his home in Roxbury, Connecticut, on the evening of February 10, 2005, the 56th anniversary of the first performance ofDeath of a Salesmanon Broadway.\nQuestion: What is the text mainly about?\nAnswer:",

A part of its attempt to increase imports, the government is trying to get people to work less and spend more. The workers are disgusted.\nThe figures support the western prejudice that the Japanese are all working without play. Trying to force workers away from their desks and machines, the government said last April that the country should cut down from its 2,100 hours average work year to 1,899 hours and a five-day by 1992. Beginning in February, banks and offices two Saturdays a month. The government hopes that others will follow that practice. But some persuasion will be needed. Small companies are very angry about it and they fear competitions may not cut hour. The unions are no happier: they have even advertised in newspapers arguing their case against the foreign pressure that is forcing leisure upon them. They say shorter hours are a disguised pay cut. The industrialists, who have no objection to the government's plans, admit that shorter hours will help them cut costs. Younger Japanese who are supposed to be acting against their hard-working parents, show no sign of wanting time off either. But unlike older workers, they do spend money in their spare time. Not content with watching TV, they dance, dress up, sit in cafes, go to pop concerts and generally drive the leisure-industry boom. Now that they know how to consume, maybe the West can teach them to relax and enjoy themselves too.\nQuestion: The passage mainly discusses   _  .\nOptions: A: a new policy threatening Japanese tradition\nB: the balance between work and play\nC: different attitudes towards short working hours\nD: generation gap",

Valentine's Day has a natural enemy in China. And it is not the Chinese _ , which falls on the seventh day of the seventh month on the lunar calendar, usually around half a year away from Feb. 14. It is the Spring Festival, also known as the Chinese New Year, which will influence the Feast of Saint Valentine.\nThe real disagreement between East and West probably took place over a century ago, when China's door was forced open by Western powers and Chinese scholars supported westernization as a means to strengthen our nation's ability to compete. The introduction of the solar calendar and Western measurements was both an acknowledgment of their influence and an effort to be accepted by the world order.\nFor a full century, we have had two systems running in parallel. When it comes to the eventual outcome, practicality usually beats all other concerns. Laws can help, such as the three traditional festivals of Tomb Sweeping, Dragon Boat and Mid-Autumn gaining legal status in 2008 and giving every Chinese citizen a day off, but laws cannot push what people have no feelings for. So, the celebration or boycott of imported holidaysor homegrown ones should be no cause for worry. If they are irrelevant, no social media will change the public's mind; and if they are accepted, there must be a need which they happen to satisfy.\nSince we have no global Qin Shihuang to force one system on every country, we can always rely on a dual   approach by which we share with the outside world on one hand but preserve our own ways of life on the other.",

But many of the expressions using water have unpleasant meanings.\nThe expression \"to be in hot water\" is one of them. It is a very old expression. \"Hot water\" was used 500 years ago to mean being in trouble. One story says it got that meaning from the custom of throwing extremely hot water down on enemies attacking a castle.\nThat no longer happens. But we still get in \"hot water\".When we are in \"hot water\", we are in trouble. It can be any kind of trouble--serious or not so serious. A person who breaks a law can be in hot water with the police. A young boy can be in hot water with his mother. if he walks in the house with dirty shoes.\nBeing in \"deep water\" is almost the same as being in hot water. When you are in deep water, you are in a difficult position. Imagine a person who cannot swim being thrown in water over his head.\nYou are in deep water when you are facing a problem that you do not have the ability to solve. The problem is too deep. You can be in deep water, for example, if you invest in stocks without knowing anything about the stock market.\n\"To keep your head above water\" is a colorful expression that means staying out of debt. A company seeks to keep its head above water during economic hard times. A man who loses his job tries to keep his head above water until he finds a new job.\n\"Water over the dam\" is another expression about a past event. It is something that is finished.

While it is generally taken as an indicator of their marital   status, the practice is primarily related to the Hindu religion. The dot goes by different names in different Hindi dialects, and \"bindi\" is the one that is most commonly known. Traditionally, the dot carries no gender restriction: Men as well as women wear it. However, the tradition of men wearing it has faded in recent times, so nowadays we see a lot more women than men wearing one.\nThe position of the bindi is standard: center of the forehead, close to the eyebrows. It represents a third, or inner eye. Hindu tradition holds that all people have three eyes: The two outer ones are used for seeing the outside world, and the third one is there to focus inward toward God. As such, the dot serves as a constant reminder to keep God in the front of a believer's thoughts.\nRed is the traditional color of the dot. It is said that in ancient times a man would place a drop of blood between his wife's eyes to seal their marriage. According to Hindu beliefs, the color red is believed to bring good fortune to the married couple. Today, people go with different colors depending upon their preferences. Women often wear dots that match the color of their clothes. Decorative or sticker bindis come in all sizes, colors and variations, and can be worn by young and old, married and unmarried people alike. Wearing a bindi has become more of a fashion statement than a religious custom.\nQuestion: What is the importance of the third eye in Hindu tradition?\nOptions: A: To pay respect to God.\nB: To stay in harmony with nature.\nC: To see things with a subjective view.\nD: To observe the outside world more clearly.",

        "Read the following article and select the best answer.\nArticle: The advantages of using flashcards to build up a vocabulary are well known. You can buy sets of cards, or make your own, and carry them with you wherever you go. There's no question this is useful and because you can use them in short bursts, it's not too much for you. It can be fun. I don't recommend drilling for hours at a time with flashcards.\nIf you want to use flashcard software, things get even better. There are many packages out there for maintaining and drilling flashcards. I recommend VTrain though there are many others.\nOne stands out, however: SuperMemo. Similar to Pimsleur, SuperMemo is engineered according to a carefully researched methodology   in order to test you on a card the very minimum number of times you need to see it for it to stick. When you look at a card, you give some feedback to the software on whether you got it right and how easy you found it. It uses this information, and that of your previous attempts, to decide when you will be shown the card next. It's smart and it really works.\nIf you're like me, the news is even better! I have a version of SuperMemo that runs on my PalmOS phone. Wherever I am, if I have my phone handy, I have thousands of flashcards with me too. Honestly, it would be worth purchasing a cheap Palm device only for this. You can pick one up for $20 or even less on eBay or elsewhere. Consider it, at least.\nQuestion: With SuperMemo, whether the next card will be shown depends on   _  .\n- the time you look at the card\n- the information in the computer\n- the feedback one gives to the software\n- the times one attempts to do with a card",

The car ride to the airport followed by a two-hour flight left our legs more worse condition than they were when we first came off the mountain we just climbed.\nWhen we heard that two seats in first class on our next flight were available for a bit higher price, we jumped at the opportunity. Our spirits lifted immediately. After all, flying first class was a new experience for us, and we would end our adventure in comfort and style.\nAs we boarded the plane, we noticed that the stewardess  was working non-stop to ensure the comfort of the first class passengers. She could not walk by a seat without receiving an order. How much she must love her job! She smiled kindly at each one while attending to their needs.\nAs the stewardess walked by our seats near the end of the flight, I looked at her and said, \"Thank you and I hope you have a great night.\" She stopped, bent down, looked at me and said, \"Excuse me.\" I repeated my words and she smiled in a rather funny way, almost as if I had asked her a question that she did not know how to answer.\nAfter a few moments she returned to our seats. \"I can tell you work with the public,\" she said. \"Why do you think so?\" I asked. She answered very quietly, \"Because you are the only passenger here to say something nice to me tonight and I really appreciate your kindness.\"\nThe sense of belonging to the elite  group of people in first class disappeared as we heard her words. Our first class seats offered us more than a comfortable ride. We were reminded that without kindness, we would be flying in no class.\nQuestion: Why did they choose to take a first class flight?\nOptions: A: Because they were extremely tired\nB: Because they wanted to go back as soon as possible\nC: Because the tickets were cheaper\nD: Because they wanted to enjoy the first class service.",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\nArticle: The choice between having a career or making time for love is an extremely personal and individual decision. There are many factors which can affect your choice.\nCareers and love fulfill us in different but important ways. Having a solid career gives us a sense of accomplishment and self worth. Then there are those who measure their success in terms of having a pleasant and rewarding home life.\nSo what happens if you cannot or do not wish to make room in your life for both? Consider these factors when pondering which is more important for you.\n1. Your Career May be More Important When You are Young\nMany people these days focus on careers first and family later. The reasoning is that, while you are young and unencumbered , you have the time and energy to fully devote yourself to a career. If you have lofty career ambitions while you are young, it may indeed be the time to start making progress towards those goals.\nOnce you get married and begin to build a family, much of your time and energy-by necessity-becomes devoted to your family. This is as it should be. You should not start a family unless you are willing to devote time and attention to your loved ones.\n2. Falling in Love can be Better When You are Older\nMore and more people these days are choosing to wait when it comes to making decisions about family. It is not unusual for people to delay marriage until their late 30's or even their early 40's. Delaying family decisions allows you to be better prepared for those obligations, and creates a better likelihood that you are in touch with your most important goals and values. You have had the opportunity to completely grow up, greatly reducing the chances of feeling like you are \"missing out.\" You have had the chance to purge the foolishness of youth from your system and are now confident with the wisdom of maturity.\n3. Choosing Both\nIf you can find a work life balance that allows you to experience the joys of love and maintain a successful career, you will have a truly happy and rewarding life. A loving...\nOptions:\nA Because family life is not important\nB Because they can devote time and energy to their careers\nC Because they don't want to devote time and attention to their loved ones\nD Because they have no time for building a family\nAnswer:\nB Because they can devote time and energy to their careers\nQuestion:",

        "Article: How time flies! One month has passed before I could take any notice of it. This is the start of my freshman year in Fudan University. At the very beginning, everything and everyone was strange to me. But now, I'm getting used to it. I'd like to tell you two important and interesting things in my university life.\n    Freedom is what I am looking forward to since my primary school. Many people said to me, \"Study hard, and you will get freedom when in university.\" But when I really entered university, I find the real situation is different. Freedom costs me a lot. If I refuse to wash my clothes, for example, they will just lie there, unclean. So I have to do everything and take care of myself. Well, I like this life style very much though it is hard at the beginning. It is really a challenge for me. \n    I appreciate a famous saying from Albert Camus, \"Freedom is nothing but a chance to be better.\" That's right. Real freedom comes with responsibility. Some teenagers believe that freedom means doing whatever you like. But I think that is not real freedom at all. One can have his or her own freedom, while at the same time respect others'. It's not easy to think on behalf of others. And now I have the precious chance to practice it.\n   Another thing I want to mention is love. Now, something interesting in Fudan is that love exists everywhere. For instance, the first lesson of my English class is about love. A small play at the Freshmen Welcome Party called \"Turn Left and Turn Right\" is about students' love in Fudan. Some of my roommates have boyfriends. At night, while lying in bed, we always share their love stories. What's more, even our instructor once said, \"In our department, girls are more than boys. So we'll have a party with the Chemistry Department, in which the situation is just the opposite.\" I was surprised about the attitude towards love here. Is she encouraging us to find someone to fall in love with? I cannot understand it quite well.\n   The above are the two things that impressed me most at the very...\nQuestion: Based on what the instructor said, we can learn that   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"students are encouraged to communicate with the opposite sex\"?",

Now, a study has found that\nwhile this is certainly true, men also have to deal with the fact that they are also more stupid than the fairer sex.\n    In the study, scientists measured the IQ of 2500 brothers and sisters and they found an\nuneven number of men not only in the top two percent, but also in the bottom two percent. The\nstudy's participants were tested on science, maths, English and mechanical abilities.\n    Though there were twice as many men as women in the smartest group, there were also\ntwice as many men among the foolish.\n      The total scores of men and women were similar.\n    One of the study's authors, psychology professor Timothy Bates, said that the phenomenon\nmay be because men have always been expected to be high achievers and women have been\nrestricted to spend more time taking care of their home.\n    \"The female developmental program may be tilted more towards ensuring survival\nand the safety of the middle ground.\"the Daily Mail quoted Professor Bates, of Edinburgh\nUniversity, as saying.\n    The research agrees with past results that men were more likely than women to receive first\nclass University degrees or thirds and women secured the seconds.\n    It has been said that men are more ready to take a risk when it comes to academics.\nWhile women have always been found to be steadier in their learning.\n    A past study has shown that women are securing more firsts and seconds, while men are\ncontinuing to receive more thirds.\n    The argument for the change is that the increase of coursework at the cost of exams favors\nwomen's steady approach.\nQuestion: The purpose of the passage is to tell us that  _  .\nOptions: A: men are smarter than women\nB: .men are more stupid than the women\nC: men are more likely to receive first class university degree\nD: new fact about the IQ of men and women has been found",

        "Article: The area south of the Thames at Greenwich has a long history. Throughout time different buildings have been constructed on the same site. The Palace of Placentia, an English Royal Palace built in 1447, no longer exists apart from a few remains under the present buildings.\nThe grand buildings on the South Bank of the Thames at Greenwich were designed by Sir Christopher Wren, most famous for St. Paul's Cathedral. The buildings were finally completed in 1745, although some parts started to be used as early as 1705. They're now part of a university -- having served as a naval hospital and a naval college and the setting for several cinemas.\nBut the buildings stand on a site which has a much longer history, of which now only a part remains that is below the ground. For nearly two hundred years, from around 1450 to 1650, Greenwich was one of the main royal palaces of England. Some of the most famous English rulers, such as Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, not only lived there, but also were born there.\nHenry VIII put an armory there, and there were also gardens, a great fountain   and a mass of buildings. The Palace was also in a strategic location, because at the time either side of Greenwich on the Thames were important Royal Dockyards  .\nEventually, though, the Palace fell into disrepair. In 1664, the King at the time, Charles II, decided to replace it with completely new buildings in a modern style. Only a cellar   from the former Royal Palace now remains, under one of the new buildings. Its red brick, typical of the 16th century, contrasts   sharply with the white stone above it.\nWould you like to join us to have a good view of Greenwich?\nQuestion: The buildings on the South Bank of the Thames at Greenwich now   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"differ from those in the 16th century\"?",

Before you go to a store to buy a bicycle, first know your need. Once the basic need is determined, then go into the small details like the frame size (Too small frames can increase the risk of the knee injuries while too large ones can be uncomfortable, so it has to be just right to suit your body frame.),brakes, chains, its efficiency and the technology employed. Don't forget the budget ! Experts say that you should be ready to spend at least 500 dollars, because anything less than that would not probably be the best. ks5u\nThere are a range of bikes to choose from. However, it's important to choose the correct one that fits a woman perfectly. This is because women usually tend to have a shorter torso and longer legs than men of the same height and so does the arm size vary. Moreover, the strength of the back needs to be considered too. Therefore, you have to find the best that suits your body type and gives you a comfortable ride.\nOptions:\nA it has a great influence on the efficiency of the bike\nB it is likely to cause injuries if it is not the right size\nC it is mainly determined by personal needs\nD it has a big influence on a woman's torso\nAnswer:\nB it is likely to cause injuries if it is not the right size\nQuestion:",

The beginning of the seventeenth century saw the happening of the slave trade. Ships from Europe travelled to the West African coast, where they exchanged cheap goods for black slaves. The slaves were shipped in terrible conditions to the Caribbean islands and the American coast, where they were in turn exchanged for such products as sugar and molasses . The ships then returned to England, completing an \"Atlantic triangle\"of journeys, and the process began again. Britain and the United States had outlawed the slave trade by 1865, but by that time, nearly 200 years of trading had taken place. By the middle of the nineteenth century, there were over four million black slaves in America.\nThe policy of the slave-traders was to bring people of different language backgrounds together in the ships, to make it difficult for groups to plan rebellion. The result was the growth of several pidgin   forms of communication, and in particular a pidgin between the slaves and the sailors many of whom spoken English. Once arriving in the Caribbean, this pidgin English continued to act as a major means of communication between teh black population and the new landowners, and among the blacks themselves. Then, when children came to be born, the pidgin became their mother tongue, thus producing the first black Creole  speech in the region. This Creole English rapidly came to be used throughout the cotton plantations  , and in the coastal towns and islands.\nQuestion: It can be inferred that the slaves in the same ship    _   .\nAnswer:",

        "Read the following article and select the best answer.\nArticle: The time of year a baby is born can shape what profession they will embark on   in later life, a new study has suggested. Being born in a certain month appears to indicate the statistical likelihood of what job a person will end up with, the study by the Office for National Statistics found. Researchers have uncovered that the month in which babies are born could also affect everything from intelligence to length of life.\nA child born December is more likely to become a dentist while someone whose birthday falls in January will tend to a debt collector, they found. A February birth appears to increase the chances of being an artist while March babies appear to go on to become pilots. Meanwhile, April and May are said to have a fairly even spread of professions, births in the summer months mean a much lower chance of becoming a high-earning football player, doctor or dentist.\nThe study was derived   by researchers who analyzed the birth months of people in 19 separate occupations using information from the last census, the Daily Mail reported. Although these trends may be difficult to explain, correlations   between birth months and specific health problems have a scientific basis. Spring babies are at greater risks of illnesses including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, asthma and autism. They may also be less clever than classmates born in other parts of the year.\nQuestion: What do the researchers also study besides the analyses of the trends between birth months and professions?\n- Some serious diseases from births of many children.\n- A lot of mental illnesses caused by giving birth to children.\n- The secret of births and healthy problems.\n- The relationship between birth months and certain health problems.",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\nArticle: I've spent over a year in India, and in those 365 plus days, I've learned a lot about getting around Indian cities. My biggest lessons have been learned through being cheated, particularly by taxi and rickshaw   drivers, but that doesn't mean those are bad ways to travel, as long as you know what you're doing. Below are the best ways to get around the city of Delhi, India, and tips for how to keep from being the victim of scams  .\nTaking taxis is a great way to get around the city of Delhi and chances are, if you arrive in Delhi by plane, as soon as you make it through customs, you'll be swarmed by Indian taxi drivers. At the Delhi airport, be sure to arrange for a taxi to your hotel at one of the two Delhi Traffic Police Taxi Booths. One is inside the airport, and one is outside. The key is to make sure to go to a booth run by the police, rather than by independent taxi drivers.\nRickshaws are one of my favorite ways to get around Indian cities, partly because it's how the locals often travel. Auto-rickshaws are more common, but bicycle rickshaws are still used in Old Delhi. If you do have a chance to take a bicycle rickshaw, you should do it at least once for a unique experience that should only set you back about 15 rupees. Auto-rickshaw rates around Delhi range between 30 and 80 rupees, depending on distance.\nIf you really want to travel around Delhi like the locals, take a public bus. Indian buses become very crowded and most do not have air conditioning. They are, however, very cheap. A bus trip won't set you back any more than 15 rupees, as long as you stay within the city limits. Since Indian buses get so crowded, try to board the bus at the start of the route so you can get a seat.\nThe train is a great way to get around within the city of Delhi. Fares are reasonable, between six and 22 rupees. All departure announcements are in both Hindi and English, and tokens can be purchased for between six and 22 rupees.\nOptions:\nA save some money\nB gain some unique experience\nC enjoy the comfortable trip\nD help the local rickshaw drivers\nAnswer:\nB gain some unique experience\nQuestion:",

We are, but we're also giving a home to lots of tiny little creatures we didn't even know about. A showerhead carries thousands of bacteria called Mycobacterium.These can cause problems like coughs and tiredness, and a general feeling of poorliness  . When you turn on the water, the bacteria go from the showerhead onto and into your body.\nThis is a finding of Norman R. Pace and his team at the University of Colorado, in the US. The scientists investigated bacteria in all kinds of human environment, including showers.Pace's team looked at 45 showerheads in nine American cities. They discovered that 30 percent of them had large amounts of flying Mycobacterium.\nBut Pace said that they _ few threats to the health.Only those with a weak immune system might need to worry.He told the New York Times that the bacteria are not as unpleasant as might be thought.He said that having a shower is no more dangerous than anything else we do in the morning.\nBut for those who feel sick about the idea of all those microorganisms  , he had some advice. Let the water run for 30 seconds before getting into the shower. Why? The number of bacteria is smaller than that when the water is just turned on. If that seems like a waste of water, he added that you could also change your showerhead every few months.\nHowever, Pace had good news too. He has also been testing the air in US subways. Apart from iron particles  , which are ground off the track by the wheels of trains, subway air is fresh. The reason is that a train's movement pumps fresh outdoor air into the tunnels.\nPace explained that he wanted to understand the natural microbial environments of public places. This kind of knowledge might help discover the microbes to be used in a bioterrorist   attack.\nOptions:\nA Hot water could kill most of bacteria in showerheads.\nB Of 45 showerheads surveyed in nine cities, 30 carried large amounts of Mycobacterium.\nC Changing showerheads is the only way to avoid microorganisms.\nD Shower water contains much less bacteria after being left to run for 30 seconds.\nAnswer:\nD Shower water contains much less bacteria after being left to run for 30 seconds.\nQuestion:",

But in fact the Christmas card is a  ly modern invention.\nIn the Middle Ages, European wood engravers  produced prints with religious themes. But the first real Christmas card, as we understand the term today, was designed in London, England in 1840. It went on sale in 1843. The designer was John Callott Horsley, a well- known British painter and member of the Royal Academy. He designed the card at the suggestion of his friend Sir Henry Cole, who was the first director of the Victoria & Albert Museum. Horsley produced 1,000 cards and offered them for sale at 1s (one shilling) each. They were printed on stiff card and coloured by hand, with the greeting: \"A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to You\". The card shows three pictures: in the center, a family party; to one side the hungry receiving food; to the other side the poor being clothed. Puritans  immediately  _ the card, since it showed people drinking in the family party. But with most people the idea was a great success and the Christmas card quickly became very popular.\nChristmas cards were not the first greetings cards. Since 1796, with improvements in printing, merchants had been sending cards to their customers offering \"best wishes\" for the new year. In many countries, Christmas cards gradually became even more popular than New Year's cards.\n    As Christmas is the birthday of Jesus Christ, cards often show scenes of His nativity. Others show images connected with Christmas such as wintry scenes of snow-laden pine, Father Christmas card is \"Merry Christmas\", but many other greetings are also used, such as \"Happy Xmas\" or \"Happy Noel\".\nQuestion: What would be the best title of the text?\nAnswer:",

The group's position was approved by some experts.\n\"There is very little one can do in order to increase the chance of having a healthy brain when you get old,\" said Dr. Hans Forstl, who has studied boxing injuries.\n\" One of the best things you can do is avoid boxing.\" He said.\nAccording to the new statement, published in the journal Pediatrics, information from Canada shows a rise in boxing injuries over the past decade.\nPat Russo, a retired police officer who runs a boxing gym in Brooklyn, New York, said injuries are rare in amateur boxing. After 26 years and training thousands of kids, he has seen just one split lip among his students.\n\" If the gym is run properly, injuries are at an absolute minimum,\" Russo said. \"Football is ten times more dangerous. While tennis or football might also help kids gain confidence, boxing holds a special attraction for children in poor neighborhoods, because it allows them to act tough while in trouble.\"\nDr. Robert Cantu, a surgeon   at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Massachusetts, said AAP's attitude makes sense for upper-class and middle-class kids.\n\" Clearly boxing is safer today than it was 20 or 30 years ago, but it is still a very risky activity,\" he said.\n\"For kids in poor areas, however, the situation is different,\" said Cantu. \" The most dangerous thing for the majority of people in boxing is just where they live.

The students from Class 2, Senior 2 of the High School Affiliated to Peking University certainly did so before they published their own collection of English novels at home.\nTheir small book contains stories about a holy   war, the happy life of a self-taught artist and the story of a laid-off worker who devoted his last breath to playing his beloved accordion  . The book becomes an instant hit on campus. About 3,000 copies have been sold and the class is already working on the second volume.\n\"We're up to our ears in homework. Exercises and exams make us out of breath.

We can learn about what a person is thinking by watching his or her body language. Words are important, but the way a person stands, folds his or her arms, or moves his or her hands can also give us information about his or her feelings.\nJust like spoken language, body language varies from culture to culture. Making eye contact --looking directly into someone's eyes -- is in some countries a way to show interest. In other countries, however, eye contact is rude or disrespectful. The gesture for Ok, making a circle with one's thumb and index finger, has different meanings in different cultures. In Japan, someone who sees another person making the gesture will think it means money. In France, a person seeing the same gesture will think it means zero. In Brazil and Germany, however, the gesture is rude. The thumbs-up gesture, meaning \"great\" or \"good job\" in the US is rude in Nigeria, but in Germany and Japan it means the number one. The \"crazy\" gesture, moving the index finger in a circle in front of the ear, means \"you have a phone call\" in Brazil.\nEven the gesture we use for \"yes\" and \"no\" are different around the world. In many countries, shaking one's head means \"no\", and nodding means \"yes\". In Bulgaria, parts of Greece, and Iran, however, the gestures have the opposite meaning. There are also differences as to how often we touch each other, how close we stand to someone we are talking to, and how we act when we meet or part. In some countries, for example, France and Russia, a visiting friend is greeted with a kiss on the check, in other countries people greet each other with a firm handshake, a loving hug, a bow or a simply a nod of the head.\nWhile there are many different interpretations of our body language, some gestures seem to be universal. Pressing one's palms together and resting one's head on the back of one's hand while closing the eyes as if sleeping means \"I am tired.\" A good way of...\nQuestion: In our daily life, which of the following do we use to communicate with each other?\n- gestures\n- words\n- smiles\n- all above",

China was only ranked 112th happiest country out of 156 in the UN's World Happiness Report in April.\nThe happiest country, it seems, is Denmark, closely followed by three more northern European countries- Finland, Norway, and the Netherlands.\nBut apart from income and lifestyle differences, there are also cultural reasons for this divide. They show that Chinese people and Westerners have different perceptions of happiness.\nAccording to a survey conducted by CCTV, income levels most affected Chinese people's sense of well- being (55.5 percent), followed by health (48.9 percent) and quality of marriage or love life (32 percent).\nIt seems that all these criteria are lagging  in China, and that the obvious explanation for greater happiness in the West is higher incomes.\nBut not so, says Professor John Helliwell, an American economist at the University of British Columbia and coauthor of the UN report.\nAccording to Helliwell, low-income individuals may experience an initial jump in happiness when their money increases, but this feeling decreases as they adapt to their new circumstances. He stresses the example of the US, where, despite GDP figures rising consistently for the past 50 years, happiness has been steadily declining.\nThis is because people desire more than money and material wealth. \"To be happy, we need to feel connection, trust and meaningful relationships,\" explains Helliwell. \nDr Deborah Swallow, a UK expert on cultural diversity however, believes there are some differences in the perceptions of happiness in the West and China. \n\"For North Americans and Europeans, happiness tends to be defined in terms of personal achievement, and is best predicted by self-esteem\" she says.\n\"For East Asians, happiness tends to be defined in terms of interpersonal connectedness, and is best predicted by how well involved the self is in a social network.\"\nLiving standards are not necessarily the last...\nOptions:\nA Happiness has nothing to do with money.\nB A man with healthy body must have the most happiness.\nC A man who has a strong social relationship is sure to be happy.\nD People's sense of happiness is determined by many factors.\nAnswer:\nD People's sense of happiness is determined by many factors.\nQuestion:",

But you'd be wrong.\nA Scandinavian manuscript ,900 years old, tells of how one player, who lost a game, picked up the board and hit his opponent on the head with it.  _ \nGrandmasters have called it \"a blood sport\", like a fight to the death with broken bottles\" and \"very dangerous--you have to kill people.\"\nIf you agree with the old saying that life is too short for chess, play blitz chess. Five minutes on the clock. Now players think chess is slow and boring, but blitz is an extremely exciting sport, and as aggressive  as any martial art . In parks in Russia, where they gather in summer to play blitz, the players don't just take pieces, they knock them off the board onto the ground. And in the classic game, even world championship players have been known to kick each other under the table.\nWith all this aggression, and the stories of nervous breakdowns among chess players, it's worth remembering that chess can heal as well as harm. My own favorite chess story is that of John Healy. His autobiography , The Grass Arena , was made into a great film by the BBC. Healy was a failed boxer who became the most serious kind of alcoholic. He became homeless. The bottle nearly killed him. But in prison, he discovered chess, and managed to give up drinking completely. He is now a successful chess player, journalist and writer.\nHealy is played in the film by the British actor Mark Rylance. It's the performance of a lifetime--chess makes surprisingly good cinema. There is a moving scene where Healy tries to find the words to describe how his life has changed. \"It's like boxing again...,but not with fists...   with the mind.\"\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes blitz chess?\n- Slow and boring.\n- Fast and interesting\n- Peaceful but exciting\n- Quick and violent.",

How do you know what you can do until you try?\"\nMr. Myrus lived around the corner, and I would often stop by to talk while he worked in his garden.

Well, then you're not a failure,\" he often told me these words.\nMr. Myrus died in 1978. I had never thought about his death. He was too young. I felt sorry.

He taught me about honor, about truth, and about doing my best--and that all feelings and beliefs have dignity and deserve respect.

It seemed like this would be a good time to let my teenage daughter Holly practice her driving, so I sent her to the store in my truck. At dinner my son talked about how much he liked my truck. I enjoyed having it, but I said, \"Guy, my heart is not set on that truck. I like it but it is just metal and won't last forever. Never set your heart on anything that won't last.\" After hearing the loud noise, the whole family ran outside. My son shouted, \"Dad! Dad! Holly crashed your truck.\"\nMy heart sank and my mind was flooded with conflicting thoughts. Was anyone hurt? Who else was involved? As I ran to the door, I heard a voice in my heart say, \"Here is a chance to show Holly what you really love. She'll never forget it.\"\nThe accident had occurred in my own driveway. Holly had crashed my truck into our other vehicle, the family van. In her inexperience, she had confused the brakes and the gas pedal  . Holly was unhurt physically but when reached her, she was crying and saying, \"Oh, Dad, I'm sorry. I know how much you love this truck.\" I held her in my arms as she cried.\nLater that week a friend dropped by and asked what had happened to my truck. I told her the whole story. Her eyes moistened  and she said, \"That happened to me when I was a girl. I borrowed my dad's car and ran into a log that had fallen across the road. I ruined the car. When I got home, my dad knocked me to the ground and began to kick me.\"\nOver 40 years later, she still felt the pain of the night. _ I remember how sad Holly was on the night she crashed our truck, and how I comforted her.

He went back to America with a business plan that would help thousands of children. While on vacation, Mycoskie saw children who couldn't afford even one pair of shoes. Their feet suffered cuts, and he wanted to help. He noticed the shoes that Argentinean farmers wore. Inspired by those simple shoes with rope bottoms, he had an idea. Mycoskie wanted to give these children the shoes they needed. He gave his new plan a name --- TOMS. For every pair of shoes he sold, he would give a new pair to a needy child. One for one.\n  It was a slap  in the face to traditional business practices. How could he make a profit by giving so much away? However, he started selling shoes out of his apartment. When he had sold 10,000 pairs of shoes, he returned to Argentina with 10,000 pairs to give away.\n  Although often taken for granted, shoes play an important role. Children without shoes easily injure their feet. They can catch a disease through soil that could make them sick or slow down their growth. Some children can't attend school without shoes because they are part of the uniform.\n  TOMS, together with other charity organizations, continues to find communities that will get benefit. Since that first \"shoe drop\" in Argentina, TOMS has contributed new shoes to communities in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America.\n  Mycoskie's special principle is all about giving. This has attracted a lot of media attention, saving money on marketing. When people hear about TOMS' purpose, they buy the shoes and then share the story with a slogan of \"shoes for a better tomorrow\".",

        "Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: Americans like to think of themselves as martyrs   to work. At this time of the year they admire the laziness of their European cousins, particularly the French. Studies show that the average American gets only four weeks of paid leave a year compared with seven for the French and eight for the German. In Paris many shops close down for August; in Washington, where the weather is really hot, they remain open, some for 24 hours a day.\nBut when it comes to the young, the situation is just opposite. American children have it easier than most other children in the world, including the supposedly lazy European children. They have one of the shortest school years anywhere, a mere 180 days compared with an average of 195 for OECD countries and more than 200 for East Asian countries. German children spend 20 more days in school than American ones, and South Koreans over a month more. Over 12 years, a 15-day deficit   means American children lose out on 180 days of school, equal to an entire year.\nAmericans also divide up their school time strangely. They cram   the school day into the morning and early afternoon, and close their schools for three months in the summer. The long summer vacation acts like a mental eraser, with the average child reportedly forgetting about a month's worth of instruction in many subjects and almost three times that in mathematics. American academics have invented a term for this phenomenon, \"summer learning loss\". It is leaving American children ill-equipped to compete. They usually perform poorly in international educational tests, coming behind Asian countries that spend less on education but work their children harder. California's state universities have to send over a third of their classes to take some extra courses in English and math.\nQuestion: During the long summer vacation, American children   _  .\nAnswer:",

Is it any wonder that there are so many problems facing indigenous   Australians today?\nWhen I was growing up in Kowanyama there were 15 people in my class, I am the only one who has gone to university. I'm also the only girl in my class who did not have a child at 15. Of the boys in my class, seven have been incarcerated, two for murder, five for robbery and rape. Only three of us are not alcoholics. Four of my classmates have committed suicide.\nLife as a young aborigine is not easy, in any setting. The story of my fellow students is a lesson in the magnitude of the problems that young indigenous people in Cape York face.\nThe two issues that are central to changing this story are education and health. There is a huge gap between what we get in communities and what other kids get in cities.\nOne of the problems facing education in remote indigenous schools is that teachers tend to be just out of training and stay for only a year or two. Not one teacher stayed for the whole of my nine years at school--not even the principals. This seeming lack of commitment makes you feel they don't care.\nWe need to review the curriculum in these communities because it is pitched at a very low level. I have had to draw the conclusion that governments and educationalists see us as less than white people.\nEducation should be uplifting, not serve to reinforce lack of self-esteem and the heart-wrenching low expectations that our race suffer from.\nWe need a massive reassessment of,education policies and an equally massive investment in education. We have spent so long listening to some white fellows telling us we are stupid, lazy no-hopers that the majority of my people actually believe it.\nThe relationship between poor education and poor health is clear.

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: There is no better way to enjoy Scottish traditions than going fishing and tasting a little bit of whisky at a quiet place like the Inverlochy Castle. When Queen Victoria visited the castle in 1873, she wrote in her diary, \"I never saw a lovelier spot ,\" And she didn't even go fishing.\nScotland is not easily defined. In certain moments, this quiet land of lakes and grasses and mountains changes before your very eyes. When evening gently sweeps the hillside into orange light, the rivers, teeming with fish, can turn into streams of gold . As you settle down with just a fishing pole and a basket on the bank of River Orchy, near the Inverlochy Castle , any frustration  will float away as gently as the circling water. It's just you and purple, pink, white flowers, seeking a perfect harmony. If you are a new comer to fishing, learning the basics from a fishing guide may leave you with a lifetime's fun. For many, fishing is more than a sport; it is an art.\nScotland offers interesting place where you can rest after a long day's fishing. Set against a wild mountain and hidden behind woodland, the beautiful Inverlochy Castle Hotel below the Nevis is a perfect place to see the beauty of Scotland's mountains. Ben Nevis is the highest of all British mountains, and reaching its 1343-metre top is a challenge. But it's not just what goes up matters; what comes down is unique. More than 900 metres high, on the mountain's north face, lies an all-important source of pure water. Its name comes from the Gaelic language \"usquebaugh\" or \"water of life\"; and it is the single most important ingredient  in Scotland's best known drink: whisky.\nQuestion: What is the main purpose of the passage?\nOptions: A: To introduce Scottish traditions to tourists.\nB: To show the attractions of Scotland to readers.\nC: To explore geographical characteristics of Scotland.\nD: To describe the pleasures of life in Scotland.",

        "Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: As you grow older, you'll be faced with some challenging decisions--like whether to cut class or try cigarettes. Making decisions on your own is hard enough, but when other people get involved and try to pressure you one way or another it can be even harder. People who are your age, like your classmates, are called peers. When they try to influence how you act, to get you to do something, it's called peer pressure.\nPeers can have a positive influence on each other. Maybe another student in your science class taught you an easy way to remember the planets in the solar system. Maybe you got others excited about your new favorite book, and now everyone's reading it. These are examples of how peers positively influence each other.\nSometimes peers influence each other in negative ways. For example, a few kids in school might try to get you to cut class with them; your soccer friend might try to convince you to be mean to another player and never pass him the ball.\nIt is tough to be the only one who says \"no\" to peer pressure, but you can do it. Paying attention to your own feelings and beliefs about what is right and wrong can help you know the right thing to do.\nYou've probably had a parent or teacher advising you to \"choose your friends wisely.\" Peer pressure is a big reason why they say this. If you choose friends who don't cut class, smoke cigarettes, or lie to their parents, then you probably won't do these things either, even if other kids do.\nIf you continue to face peer pressure and you're finding it difficult to handle, talk to someone you trust. Don't feel guilty if you've made a mistake or two.\nQuestion: For whom is the passage most probably written?\nAnswer:",

During the day they sleep in hard-to-find spots.\n\"Dad, why do you need to count owls?\" she asked. \"It's important for the scientists to have current information about bird populations,\" he explained. \"We want to know which birds have decreased in number and whether any new kinds of birds are coming into a certain area.

        "You're sitting on the train home and the person opposite you yawns . Suddenly, you're yawning with him, though you're not tired.\nThis phenomenon confused scientists for years until a recent study found that people tend to sympathize with fellow humans. Supporting this claim was the discovery that those children who were unable to form normal emotional ties with others did not experience contagious  yawning, which showed that humans communicate regularly with out words.\nHugo Critchley, a neuroscientist, has conducted an experiment recently, which will prove that happiness and sadness can spread like the common cold. According to Critechley, our mind and body are in constant exchange about how we're feeling. \"Emotions are closely linked with states of internal  responses,\" he explained. \" There are also more visible changes in our gestures and facial expression. When we're in a group, these signals can spread to another person. For example, there's the obvious tendency to smile when smiled at and there are less obvious changes that reflect emotions of surprise, anger or sadness such as a change in our heart rate and blood pressure.\nHugo Critchley further explained, \"Our bodies synchronies and when we like the other person, we ever copy his behavior. Next time you chat with a friend, take note of how you're sitting-- it's pretty likely that you will be the same. Scientists believe it's our way of telling each other that we're partners. Through body language, humans give each other very subtle  but clear signals that show emotions.\"\nSo, what lessons can we learn from this? \" Spend time with happy people-- otherwise your health could suffer,\" said Critchley.\" When we're sad, our body goes into fight or flight mode. But when we're happy, our body works normally and we feel relaxed and positive. So we look bright, our skin glows, we feel healthy and it affects everyone around us.\"\nAccording to Hugo Critchley,   _  .\nA) emotions are as visible as facial expressions\nB) we yawn more frequently when we have a cold\nC) emotions are connected with states of internal responses\nD) the change of blood pressure is not linked with the change of emotions.",

        "Article: The most common use of intelligence test scores is to predict degree of academic success. Such scores are used in some communities as bases for admitting able children to schools at ages younger than normal, and they are very generally used to determine admissions to schools beyond public secondary school. Another use common in elementary schools involves comparing such scores with performances in various subjects to identify children who are working below capacity.\nThe greatest problem in using intelligence tests for the purpose of prediction is that no dependable criterion of their accuracy exists. The ideal criteria would be objective and reliable achievement tests following instruction in each subject, but there are few such tests, especially at the college level. Studies have shown that correlations  between intelligence tests and achievement tests in various subjects through secondary school range roughly from 0.5 to 0.8. Such correlations are fairly high, but they do not suggest anywhere near complete agreement.\nAt the college level there are two major tests used as criteria of admission. By far the more important is the College Entrance Examination, constructed by the Educational Testing Service authorized by the College Entrance Examination Board. These tests are returned to the Educational Testing Service for scoring, and the results are then made available to the various colleges authorized by the students to receive them. The second test of this type is the American College Test, which operates in essentially the same fashion.\nBoth tests constitute measures of certain skills, abilities, and knowledge that have been found to be related to success in college. Their correlations with academic success are limited for three outstanding reasons. First, measures of achievement in college are themselves perhaps no more reliable than those in elementary and secondary schools. Second, intellectual factors do not alone determine academic success, especially at the college level.

Different reasons are given for America's weight problem---a problem increasingly shared by other countries. Almost one-fifth of American children and teenagers are overweight.\nSchools have been asked to increase physical education, an important tool for public health. However, a recent study has shown an increase in the number of injuries in P.E. classes.\nResearchers say one possible reason for this is a decrease in the number of school nurses. Schools without a nurse on duty may be more likely to send an injured child to a hospital.\nAnother possible reason for more injuries is a change in the traditional idea of physical education. This \"New P.E.\" expands the kinds of sports that are taught. But activities that some schools offer now, like rock climbing and skateboarding, can also increase the risks, says Cheryl Richardson, who is with the National Association for Sport and Physical Education(NASPE).\nShe also says not all states require P.E. teachers to be specially trained. Untrained teachers could be less likely to recognize unsafe conditions.\nCheryl Richardson points to one of the study's findings -that injuries are often the result of contact with a person or a structure. This tells her that the teachers were not giving each student enough space to move around safely.\nSix activities produced seventy percent of all injuries: running, basketball, football, volleyball, rugby and gymnastics.\nThe researchers say larger class sizes are another possible reason for the increase in injuries. Larger classes can mean less supervision .

        "Read the article and select the best answer.\nArticle: There are many differences between America and China. The biggest difference is traffic rules. In America there are too much more cars than in China. But there are much fewer traffic jams and accidents in America than in China. We hardly see traffic police in the street, but all cars obey strictly traffic rules, and people hardly find that a car does not obey traffic rules in the street.\nAbout American traffic rules, there are many better terms, such as:\n1. Stop line: There are stop lines in all crossing without traffic light (some have two stop lines and others have four stop lines). All cars must stop while meeting the stop line.\n2. Traffic light: There is traffic light in the crossing of the road. Cars may almost turn every direction. The traffic light can give signal step by step including u-turn. There is a kind of middle lane of turning left. When a car wants to turn left in the road, he may enter into the middle lane of turning left and give a signal of turning left. When he thinks being safe, he may turn left. In many conditions the order of passing is also given very specifically. If people want to change lane or turn, they must look behind and think being safe. Only so, they may do it.\n3. Specific item: Such as parking, there are three kinds of lines (their colors are white, blue or red) in the roadside. Every line may park different kinds of cars. There are many streets in some residential areas  , and there is a kind of rule that any car cannot park at any time or any period time. In every parking, there are some special positions for invalid   people.\n4. About the priority of passenger and car: At any case, passengers have the priority to cars. And only after passengers have passed the road and got the top of sidestep, cars may go ahead.\nIn general, traffic rules of America are very specific, convenient, safe and humanizing.\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?\nOptions: A: In America, all cars in the crossing must stop when they meet the stop line.\nB: In America, any car cannot park in the streets in some residential areas.\nC: If people want to turn, they can obey the guide of the traffic police.\nD: There are more traffic jams in China.",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\nArticle: The surprising experiment I am about to describe proves that air is all around you and that it presses down upon you. Air pressure is a powerful force. When you swim underwater, you can feel water pushing on your body. The air all around you does the same. However, your body is so used to it that you do not notice this. The pressure is caused by a layer   of air called the atmosphere. This layer surrounds the Earth, extending to about five kilometers above the Earth's surface.\nThe following experiment is an easy one that you can do at home. But make sure that you are supervised  , because you will need to use matches. Now for the experiment.\nWhat you need\n* hard-boiled egg without the shell\n* A bottle with a neck slightly smaller than the egg\n* A piece of paper\n* A match\nMethod\n1) Check that the egg will sit firmly on the neck of the bottle.\n2) Tear the paper into pieces and put them into the bottle.\n3) Light the paper by dropping a burning match into the bottle.\n4) Quickly sit the egg on the neck of the bottle.\nResult\nAstonishingly, the egg will be sucked into the bottle. Your friends will be amazed when you show them the experiment. But be careful when you handle matches.\nWhy it happened?\nAs the paper burns, it needs oxygen and uses up the oxygen (air) in the bottle. The egg acts as a scale in the neck of the bottle, so no more air can get inside. This reduces the air pressure inside the bottle. The air pressure must equalize, so more air from outside must enter the bottle. The outside air presses against the egg, and then the egg is pushed into the bottle! This proves that air is all around and that it is pressing down on us.\nOptions:\nA water pushes on your body when you swim underwater\nB the earth is surrounded by a layer of air called the atmosphere\nC the pressure of air around us has a powerful force\nD the air pressure is not equalized around us\nAnswer:\nC the pressure of air around us has a powerful force\nQuestion:",

Robert Dane and his Solar Sailor were given the top prize at the Australian Design Awards recently.\n     The Solar Sailor has been in use for six months. It uses four sources of energy for its power -- solar, wind, battery power with stored solar energy and a fuel generator  in store all controlled by computers. The ferry can travel up to 7.5 knots on just wind and solar power. It's solar wings and fiberglass solar panels   which not only take in sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails.\n      \"We angle  our solar panels to the sun in two planes , which increases the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40 percent,\" Dane says. \"And also we can use that same structure to do another job, which is also the sail, and so these wing sails actually push the ferry forward just like a soft sail does.\"\n      Computers check the sun and wind and angle the solar wings to take in the most sunlight. If there isn't much wind or it is a cloudy day, energy stored in the batteries runs the electric motor for up to five hours.\n\"If the batteries are too low, then the computer turns the generator on so the boat is always able to meet a commercial schedule, or get from point A to point B no matter what,\" Dan explains.\n     Dane got his idea for the Solar Sailor from a book on insects. He was amazed how insects use their wings to collect solar energy to warm themselves.\n      \"When I read that, I realized there was a good example in nature for what we were going to do, which was to use a solar wing to collect solar energy and also to sail,\" he says.",

Dad did some research and had no difficulty in finding us cheap tickets online.\nOn the day of our flight, we had to wake up very early. When we checked our bags in, we found that one bag weighed too much, so we had to pay a fine. After that, Dad insisted that we go and have some breakfast at the airport restaurant. We had a lot of fun watching many different people there. Then we realized it was getting late, so we rushed to the gate. It took one hour for everyone to get on the plane, but finally the door was shut and we were on our way!\nI think my favorite experience during our trip was our visit to Mount Rainier, a volcano near Seattle. It was nothing like I had expected. Before we left, my aunt lent us hats to protect us from getting sunburned, so I supposed that it would be very hot. Imagine my surprise when we drove up the mountain and I discovered the top was covered in snow and ice!\nMy uncle led us to a small path beyond the main trails to increase our chances of seeing wildlife. We walked over a small hill, and suddenly before us there appeared a field of snow. Small wild flowers grew up through the snow; underneath the snow we could hear rushing water -- a small stream. Little animals stood still to avoid being noticed; tiny birds rose into the air. It was the most beautiful sight that I'd ever seen.\nQuestion: Why did they choose a small path instead of the main trails?\nYes or no, is the answer \"To enjoy more of the wildlife.\"?",

Being situated between them means the islands experience some of the strongest earthquakes and most powerful volcanic eruptions known on Earth.\nThe Pacific Ring of Fire is the world's greatest earthquake belt according to U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), because of its series of fault  lines covering about 25,000 miles from Chile through Japan and Southeast Asia.\nEarthquakes usually occur along faults, which are breaks in the rocky plates. About 90 percent of all the world's earthquakes, and 80 percent of the world's largest earthquakes, strike along the Pacific Ring of Fire. About 17 percent of the world's largest earthquakes and 5-6 percent of all quakes occur alone the Alpide belt. In 2009 alone Indonesia had 10 earthquakes greater than magnitude   6.0, according to the USGS.\nMonday's 7.7-magnitude earthquake that caused a 3-meter-high tsunami, killing at least 113 people, occurred when the Australian and Sunda plates struck into each other.

The studies, mostly carried out in the prefix = st1 /United States, largely focused on television, but some looked at video games, films, music, computer and Internet use. Three quarters of them found that increased media viewing was connected with poor health.\nThe studies offered strong evidence that children who get more media exposure are more likely to become overweight, start smoking and begin earlier sexual activity than those who spend less time in front of a screen, the researchers said. Studies also showed more media exposure is linked to drug and alcohol use and poorer school performance. \"We were pretty surprised by the number of studies that showed these negative health results,\" said one of the researchers in the report.\nFor decades, experts have worried about the effect on young viewers of the violence and sexual content in some TV programs, movies and video games. Another issue is that kids are spending time sitting on a couch  watching TV or playing computer games when they could be running around outside. \nOne study found that children who spend more than eight hours watching TV per week at age 3 are more likely to be overweight at 7. And research showed that many USchildren watch far more. Another study showed TV and other media content can have a deep influence on children's attitudes and beliefs, particularly among teens. A US study published in November showed that adolescents who watched more programs with sexual themes had a higher risk of becoming pregnant   or causing a pregnancy. Thirteen of 14 studies that evaluated  sexual behavior found a connection between media exposure and earlier sexual behavior, the researchers said.\nQuestion: How did the experts carry out their research?\nYes or no, is the answer \"By analyzing 173 studies on influences of media sources.\"?",

It is surprising how few people really do this carefully. Once I arrived at he airport a few minutes after ten. My secretary had got the ticket for me and I thought she had said that the plane left at 10:50. When I arrived at the airport, the person at the departure desk told me that my flight was closed. Therefore, I had to wait three hours for the next one and missed an important meeting.\nThe second rule is to remember that even in this age of credit cards  , it is still important to have some local money in cash  . Once I arrived at a place at midnight and the bank at the airport was closed. The only way to get to my hotel was by taxi but because I had no dollars, I offered to pay in pounds instead. \"Listen! I only take real money!\" the driver said angrily. You can imagine how terrible I felt at that moment.\nThe third and the last rule is to find out as much as you can about the weather at your destination  before you leave.

With the coming of new technologies like computers and smartphone, writing by hand has become something of nostalgic  skill. However, while today's educators are using more and more technology in their teaching, many believe basic handwriting skills are still necessary for students to be successful---both in school and in life.\nVirginia Berninger, professor of educational psychology at the University of Washington, says it's important to continue teaching handwriting and help children acquire the skill of writing by hand.\nBerninger and her colleagues conducted a study that looked at the ability of students to complete various writing tasks---both on a computer and by hand. The study, published in 2009, found that when writing with a pen and paper, participants wrote longer essays and more complete sentences and had a faster word production rate.\nIn a more recent study, Berninger looked at what role spelling plays in a student's writing skills and found that how well children spell is tied to know well they can write. \"Spelling makes some of the thinking parts of the brain active which helps us access our vocabulary, word meaning and concepts. It is allowing our written language to connect with ideas.\" Berninger said.\nSpelling helps students translate ideas into words in their mind first and then to transcribe  \"those words in the mind written symbols on paper or keyboard and screen,\" the study said. Seeing the words in the \"mind's eye\" helps children not only to turn their ideas into words, says Berninger, but also to spot  spelling mistakes when they write the words down and to correct then over time.\n\"In our computer age, some people believe that we don't have to teach spelling because we have spell checks,\" she said. \"But until a child has a functional spelling ability of about a fifth grade level, they won't have the knowledge to choose the correct spelling among the options given by the computer.\"\nQuestion: What conclusion could be drawn from the passage?\nAnswer:",

Working outside not only made her body strong but also made her learn about the Underground Railroad,on which she helped hundreds of people escape from slavery later. She also learned many things from the other slaves,which one day would help her lead her people to freedom. She became more of a rebel  .\nIn 1844,at about age 24,she married a free black man named John Tubman. By now,Harriet was sure she wanted to try to escape. Suddenly,the time came. Her owner died. Though opposed by her husband,she decided to escape.

Harriet traveled back and forth eighteen times,helping about 300 slaves escape into free territory. She became an expert at hiding from slave hunters. The people she helped called her Moses. At one time,anyone finding Harriet was promised $40,000 for catching her-dead or alive.\nDuring the Civil War,Harriet Tubman went into enemy territory to spy for the North. She also served as a nurse. After four years of bloody fighting,the North won the war.\nAfter the fighting ended,Harriet Tubman returned to Auburn,New York. She kept working. She traveled and gave speeches to raise money for better education for black children. She also worked for women's rights and housing. Harriet Tubman died in 1913.She was about 93 years old. By that time,she was recognized as an American hero. The United States government gave a funeral with military honors for the woman known as Moses.\nQuestion: Which of the following is true of the Underground Railroad?\n- It was a system that helped slaves escape from the South to North.\n- It was a special train,on which slaves couldn't be found easily.\n- It was a special place where slaves could hide themselves.\n- It was a group of people who would like to help the blacks.",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\nArticle: The biggest danger facing airlines nowadays may not be a terrorist with a gun, but the man with portable computer in business class. In the last 16 years, pilots have reported well over 100 incidents that could have been caused by electromagnetic interference  . The source of this interference remains not proved, but increasingly, experts are pointing the blame at portable electronic devices such as portable computers, radio and cassette players and mobile telephones.\nRTC.A. an organization which advises the aviation ( )industry, has suggested that all airlines ban such devices from being used during \"critical\" stages of flight particularly take-off and landing. Some experts have gone further, calling for a total ban during all flights. Currently , rules on using these devices are left up to individual airlines. And although some air- lines prevent passengers from using such equipment during take-off and landing, most are unwilling to carry out a total ban, given that many passengers want to work during flight.\nThe difficulty is predicting how electromagnetic fields might affect an aircraft's computers. Experts know that portable devices send out radiation which affects those wavelengths which aircraft use for navigation and communication. But, because they have not been able to reproduce these effects in a laboratory, they have no way of knowing whether the interference might be dangerous or not.\nThe fact that aircraft may be fragile to interference raises the risk that terrorists may use radio systems in order to damage navigation equipment. As worrying,though, is the passenger who can 't hear the instructions to turn off his radio because the music's too loud.\nOptions:\nA a new rule for all airlines\nB the disadvantages of electronic devices\nC a possible cause of aircraft incidents\nD effective safety measures for air flight\nAnswer:\nC a possible cause of aircraft incidents\nQuestion:",

There was a terrible thunderstorm as we crossed a vast open plain. Later we had a quick tour of Ulan Bator.\nNext, the train took us into Siberia. After a stop at Irkutsk, a popular holiday resort  , where a tour group left the train, we passed the great Lake Baikal. Later, we saw some lovely wooden houses in pretty, sunny countryside. This surprised us, as we had imagined Siberia as being covered in thick snow.\nOver the next few days, we passed through Novosibirsk, Omsk and other cities in the heartlands of the Russian Federation. By now, our body clocks were losing their sense of time. We wanted to sleep and eat at the wrong time!\nAt last we reached Moscow. We were too tired and slept for 16 hours that night.

Whether in sports or school, children often face lots of pressure to succeed and do well, and the school was becoming concerned.\n\"Young people from all walks of life live in a high-pressure environment where they are trying very hard to achieve a level of perfection,\" said Sue Bruce, head of personal and social education in the school.\n\"This week at Fettes we have been focusing on one of the most misunderstood parts of success: failure. While we are often scared of failure, it is important to learn that it is only through failing, often many times, that we learn how to succeed. All through the week, we have looked at the experiences of some of the most successful inventors, artists and businessmen, who failed hundreds, if not thousands of times on their journey to success,\" read a letter on Fettes College's website.\nTo celebrate failure, students were encouraged to try something they've never done before, like playing an instrument or dancing in front of audiences. A number of students stepped up and tried things that they finally failed in, but they had fun and enjoyed the experience. \"The concert was extremely enjoyable, proving that we should always try not to worry about failure and have a go!\" read another note on the website. Students were also taught about famous people like J.K. Rowling and Richard Branson who failed many times before they finished what they set out to do.\n\"If they let the fear of failure stop them from doing something, they are actually stopping themselves from learning, developing, and potentially succeeding,\"said Bruce.\nQuestion: During the \"failure week\" the students could do the following things EXCEPT   _  ?\nAnswer:",

        "Most people agree that honesty is a good thing. But does Mother Nature agree? Animals can't talk, but can they lie in other ways? Can they lie with their bodies and behavior?\nAnimal experts may not call it lying, but they do agree that many animals, from birds to chimpanzees, behave dishonestly to fool other animals. Why? Dishonesty often helps them survive.\nMany kinds of birds are very successful at fooling other animals. For example, a bird called the plover sometimes pretends to be hurt in order to protect its young. When a predator   gets close to its nest, the plover leads the predator away from the nest. How? It pretends to have a broken wing. The predator follows the \"hurt\" adult, leaving the baby birds safe in the nest.\nAnother kind of bird, the scrub jay, buries its food so it always has something to eat. Scrub  jays are also thieves. They watch where others bury their food and steal it. But clever scrub jays seem to know when a thief is watching them. So they go back later, unbury the food, and bury it again somewhere else.\nBirds called cuckoos have found a way to have babies without doing much work. How? They don't make nests. Instead, they get into other birds' nests secretly. Then they lay their eggs and fly away. When the baby birds come out, their adoptive parents feed them.\n _ After a fight, the losing chimp will give its hand to the other. When the winning chimp puts out its hand, too, the chimps are friendly again. But an animal expert once saw a losing chimp take the winner's hand and start fighting again.\nChimps are sneaky in other ways, too. When chimps find food that they love, such as\nbananas, it is natural for them to cry out. Then other chimps come running. But some clever chimps learn to cry very softly when they find food. That way, other chimps don't hear them, and they don't need to share their food.\nAs children, many of us learn the saying \"You can't fool Mother Nature.\" But maybe you can't trust her, either.\nBy \"Chimpanzees, or chimps, can also be sneaky\" , the author means   _  .\nA) chimps are ready to attack others\nB) chimps are sometimes dishonest\nC) chimps are jealous of the winners\nD) chimps can be selfish too",

        "Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: Every day, millions of shoppers hit the stores in full force--both online and on foot--searching for the perfect gift. Aside from purchasing holiday gifts, most people regularly buy presents for other occasions throughout the year, including weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and baby showers. This frequent experience of gift-giving can cause _ feelings in gift-givers. Many enjoy the opportunity to buy presents because gift-giving offers a powerful means to build stronger bonds with one's closest persons. At the same time, many fear the thought of buying gifts; they worry that their purchases will disappoint rather than delight the intended receivers.\nWhat is surprising is that gift-givers have considerable experience acting as both gift-givers and gift-recipients, but nevertheless tend to overspend each time they set out to purchase a meaningful gift. In the present research, we propose a unique psychological explanation for this overspending problem -- i.e., that gift-givers equate how much they spend with how much receivers will appreciate the gift (the more expensive the gift, the stronger a gift-recipient's feelings of appreciation). Although a link between gift price and feelings of appreciation might seem intuitive   to gift-givers, such an assumption may be unfounded. Indeed, we propose that gift-receivers will seldom tend to base their feelings of appreciation on the significance weight of a gift than givers assume.\nWhy do gift-givers assume that gift price is closely linked to gift-recipients' feelings of appreciation? Perhaps givers believe that bigger (i.e., more expensive) gifts convey stronger signals of thoughtfulness and consideration. According to Camerer (1988) and others, gift-giving represents a symbolic ritual , by which gift-givers attempt to signal their positive attitudes toward the intended receiver and their willingness to invest resources in a future relationship. In this sense, gift-givers may be motivated to spend more money on a gift in order to send a \"stronger...\nQuestion: The authors indicate that people value gift-giving because they feel it   _  .\nAnswer:",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\nArticle: Family relationship, love and friendship are the three most important emotions in the world. Family relationship is the inborn connection, which you can't avoid or choose at will. Love, for a student, is not always within our reach and as for friendship, personally, it's most important. Nowadays, it is common to see friendship in colleges or middle schools. What is difficult is how to deal with personal contacts between different sexes. The key is to know how to tell love from friendship.\nThe term, friend, covers a much wider range of meanings. It can be a nodding acquaintance, a comrade, a confident  , a partner, a playmate, a brother, etc. Everyone needs friendship. No one can sail the ocean of life single handed. We need help from, and also give help to, others. In the modern age, people attach more importance to relations and connections. Without stars, the night sky won't be so beautiful; without friendship, our life won't be meaningful. With friendship, life is happy and harmonious. So, friendship may be a quiet walk in the park with the one you trust if possible, while love is the company you are always feeling like keeping. And friendship is when someone gazes into your eyes, you feel only care and calm while love is when someone gazes into your eyes, you will not keep calm.\nLove is not a word spoken out easily. In a way, love is selfish, while friendship is selfless and extensive. Love is not necessarily to be returned. But friendship needs something in exchange. You can't wish \"let there be love in our hearts\", for love needs enough time to sow, to water and to take good care of and also needs a rosy, calm, relaxed, emotional and private atmosphere. With such heavy feelings of high pressure and nervousness, do you think the schoolyard the proper field for us middle school students to sow our love?\nOptions:\nA Students can't tell love from friendship.\nB Schools lack correct and strict control.\nC Students lack great expectations.\nD Students' learning load is too heavy.\nAnswer:\nA Students can't tell love from friendship.\nQuestion:",

The goal was to communicate by radio in clear and simple English with people whose native language is not English. Experts said the goal was admirable, but the method would not work. They were proved wrong. The Special English programs quickly became some of the most popular on VOA. And they still are.\nForty years later, Special English continues to communicate with people who are not fluent in English. But during the years its role has expanded. It also helps people learn American English. And it provides listeners, even those who are native English speakers, with information they cannot find elsewhere.\nToday, Special English broadcasts around the world seven days a week, five times a day. Each half-hour broadcast begins with ten minutes of the latest news followed by 20 minutes of feature programming. There is a different short feature every weekday about science, development, agriculture and environment, and on the weekend, about news events and American idioms.\nThree elements make Special English unique. It has a limited vocabulary of 1500 words. Most are simple words that describe objects, actions or emotions. Some are more difficult. They are used for reporting world events and describing discoveries in medicine and science. Special English is written in short, simple sentences that contain only one idea. No idioms are used. And Special English is spoken at a slower pace, about two-thirds the speed of Standard English. This helps people learning English hear each word clearly. It also helps people who are English speakers understand complex subjects.\nThrough the years, Special English has become a very popular tool for teaching English, even though it was not designed as teaching program. It succeeds in helping people learn English in a non-traditional way. Individuals record the programs and play them over and over to practice their listening skills. In countries around the world, English...\nQuestion: At the beginning, Special English program was  _  .\nOptions: A: well received\nB: rejected by native people\nC: doubted by some professionals\nD: intended for teaching English",

No kidding.\nBai Minghui, a Beijing-based designer, creates his artwork using Tyvek, a synthetic  paper material which is difficult to tear, waterproof and, more importantly, totally recyclable.\nBorn to a worker family in 1983 in Tangshan, Hebei Province, Bai worked as a graphic designer at a financial magazine in Beijing after graduating from Minzu University of China.\nIn the spring of 2008, Bai visited an exhibition about Tyvek in Beijing's 798 art zone, and then worked with the material, trying to bring his designs to life. The first thing that came into his mind was the paper wallet, a must-try handicraft assignment that most Chinese students do in elementary school.\n\"A paper wallet is definitely more useful than a paper crane or frog,\" Bai told Beijing Review, smiling. \"At first, many people have no idea what it is, because it looks like a piece of newspaper or an express parcel receipt, and feels like real paper. But it's hard to tear.\"\n\"The completed, folded wallet is seamless , which creates so much fun for a designer. To be honest, I didn't think about profits at all,\" he said.\nAfter months of research and development on printing and designing, the first generation of his paper wallet made a stunning debut in May 2008. The second generation, which offers a greater range of pattern options, was put on the market at the beginning of 2009.\n\"You can have graffiti or write down phone numbers on it, or paint whatever you like. I would like people to be able to use it easily,\" he said. \"I don't want to do things without creative ideas. Now my focus is on how to create better design rather than the wallet itself.\"\nQuestion: What can people do with this kind of wallet?\nOptions: A: They can use it as a handkerchief.\nB: They can make it into a dictionary.\nC: They can write their friend's phone number on it.\nD: they can buy a paper frog or paper crane with it.",

The man in the Mercury  capsule was alone, but friendly voices reached him by radio. On the dark land 100 miles below, he saw a sprinkling of light. They marked the city of Perth, where people had turned on their lights as a greeting to him.\nIn Friendship7, Glenn radioed, \" The lights show up very well. Thank for everybody for turning them on.\" His capsule raced on to the east.\nDuring his three orbits(......) of the earth, Glenn could always reach one of eighteen tracking stations. Some of them were on ship at sea. Others were in the United States.\nMany of the stations had been built with the help of other countries. These countries allowed Americans to bring in radio equipment and set it up. Without the help of such lands as Nigeria , Zanzibar(,), and Mexico, there would have been breaks in the worldwide radio network.\nJohn H. Glenn. Jr., was the first America to orbit the earth. For his flight, the tracking network  covered 60,000 route miles. Five hundred men worked in the stations along the route. Since his flight, the network has grown.

His work helped inspire the creation of the personal computer and the Internet.\nArtificial Intelligence\nBefore Minsky, computers were more like calculators, performing math operations at speeds much faster than humans. Minsky was the first to say that computers can one day be as intelligent as human beings. He was so convinced about this, that in 1959, he and his friend John McCarthy invented the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nMinsky wrote a book called Perceptrons, describing a particular type of \"artificial neural  network\". Neural networks have made a comeback in a new field of Computer Science called Deep Learning. Deep Learning is used to recognize things and people in pictures (as seen in Facebook and Google Photos), language translation( try Google Translate sometimes), and so on.\nRobotics, Microscopes and Virtual Reality\nHow many of you have done Robotics at school and loved it? You have Minsky to thank again, for his work on Robotics. One of his biggest inventions was the confocal scanning microscope, an instrument that is still widely used today in medical and scientific research.\nMinsky was really futuristic. He created one of the first head-mounted graphics displays , which gave rise to the exciting area of Virtual Reality. This year, Facebook is releasing Oculus, a virtual reality headset, which you can use to play games with your friends in a 3-D environment.\nMinsky's major prediction that computers will one day become as intelligent as humans is now called the Theory of Singularity.\nQuestion: Which is NOT one of Minsky's characteristics according to the passage?\nOptions: A: Farsighted.\nB: Creative.\nC: Pioneering.\nD: Considerate.",

The three main warning signs are an increase of coughing that doesn't clear up, coughing up blood and sharp chest pains.\nPeople with those symptoms should see a doctor.

And more than 80 percent of the respondents  surveyed said something must be done to narrow the expanding gap between the rich and poor, while 14.1 percent said it was necessary.\nThe polarization has aroused wide concern among the public in recent years. The State Development and Reform Commission  said the _ had reached 0.47 for China, up from o.29 two decades ago. Usually, a country with a number above 0.4 is warned to pay attention to the income inequality problem.\nTo find out the people's view, the survey covered 10,250 respondents, between the ages of 20 and 30 with a college education and a monthly salary between 1,000 and 3,000 yuan. Surprisingly, most disagreed with the view of experts who claim the urban-rural difference is causing the widening gap. More than 70 percent of the respondents believed that \" the group of special interests\" is the prime reason for the polarization, followed by \"people in power\" 68 percent, and \"bosses\" 50 percent.\nAnother unexpected finding is that almost all agreed that a good educational background and knowledge were not the decisive factors in gaining wealth. About 95 percent said rich people are not necessarily those who are able to speak English or have a college education.\nToday in China, rich people , accounting for 10 percent of the population, control 45 percent of the total social fortune, and poor people, also 10 percent of the population, only control 1.5 percent, according to an investigation published by the National Bureau of Statistics last June.",

Our hearts' desire is to give and receive love in relationships that make us feel that even if others disagree with what we do or say, they still love us, accept us, and appreciate what we give to the world. While it would be wonderful to have these types of relationships with all people, we know that's hard to do. However, we can have such relationships with some others, but only when we first have them with ourselves--and, strangely, this is often the hardest relationship of all.\nDo you love yourself? You may think you do, but do you really? There's only one way to find out-- by taking a close look at what you think, say, and do. You may not like some of what you find, but if you are serious about really loving yourself, you can use this insight to do some positive inner work. Here're three ways for gaining greater personal insight for deeper love:\nListen Closely to Your Thoughts\nYour thoughts will determine your actions. One thing helping you to listen to your thoughts is keeping a journal. It is not necessary for you to write in it every day, but it helps to record various insights you gain as you go about your life. Instead of using a big notebook, you might use a small notepad that you can keep in your pocket for easy access to record your thoughts as they occur to you. Whichever method you choose, what's most important is that you write your thoughts down. It will help you know what's in your heart.\nBe Honest with Yourself\nTo do this, you should pay attention to your actions. Actions speak louder than words, and they always tell the truth. If you say you love your job, but your actions say otherwise, which do you think is more reliable? On the other hand, if you say you're not good at a certain job, but your actions say otherwise, that's also important. What do you do with this insight? You can use it to make more positive choices in your life. By being honest with yourself, you will act according to truth instead of just what you...\nQuestion: .It can be learned from the passage that if we want to have love without limits, we must first of all_.\nOptions: A: be honest with ourselves anytime\nB: give our love to others generously\nC: love ourselves unconditionally\nD: take quiet time and think deeply",

Turning over its pages is my way of knowing it's time to relax and slow down.\" Meier, who's sticking with physical books, doesn't consider herself any kind of digital \"resister.\" \"I'm comfortable with all forms of technology,\" she says. \"However, when it comes to books, I suppose I'm a traditionalist. My _ will always be the real thing.\"\nTo her, part of the joy of reading is the book itself: \"pulling it from the shelf, inspecting the cover, letting it fall open to a random page.\"\nBoth have lots of company. Statistics show that e-book sales grew 43% last year, but that's a slowdown compared with the triple-digit increases in recent years. E-books remain the fastest-growing part of the book market but account for only about 20% of all sales, reported by publishers.\nMiscioscio and Meier are at opposite ends of a book business in transition. Even though e-book sales have grown more than 4,000% since 2008, it's unlikely that physical books will disappear the way records did in the music industry.\nQuestion: What is the passage mainly concerned with?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Readers go their own way in choosing books.\"?",

Well, I'll tell you why it's one of the best movies ever. The Sound of Music simply has everything one could want in a movie.\nFirst of all, it has a real romance--one where you can watch the _ slowly fall in love.\nSecondly, it has humor, clever and sarcastic  humor. When Schraeder said, \" Bye, Maria, I'm sure you'll make a fine nun .\" You just want to slap  her across the face after hearing that.\nThirdly, it's got adventure. The Nazis are the worst \"bad guys\" in any movie, so it's great to see Maria, the Captain and the kids outwit  them.\nFourthly, it's got great music. The songs of the film are popular all over the world.\nFifthly, it's got great scenery. The plot  and dialogue are also amazing. I find new things to admire each time I watch.\nFinally, is there a greater scene in any movie than the nuns showing the stolen Nazi car parts? In short, the film doesn't just succeed because it cheers people up with a beautiful love story or songs. It also succeeds because it's a wonderfully-constructed, wonderfully-written, and wonderfully-acted movie.\nOptions:\nA in the author's opinion, The Sound of Music succeeds mainly because of its songs\nB the author can find something new to enjoy every time he watches the movie\nC Maria just wants to slap Schraeder after hearing what she says to her.\nD The Sound of Music is a movie about how Maria outwits the Nazis with the nuns\nAnswer:\nB the author can find something new to enjoy every time he watches the movie\nQuestion:",

        "Article: We each have a unique genetic (,) make-up. Every cell of your body has the same set of about 100,000 separate genes made of DNA. These are the instructions for producing a person. Genes decide everything from the colour of your skin to the way your brain works. You have one of several billion combinations of DNA which come from the random mixing of your parents' genes. Except for identical twins  , no one has the same combination as another person. You are unique! You are unique in another way too: in the way you are raised and all the experiences you have from before birth to adult life. These experiences influence you, your behaviour and attitudes, and the choices you make.\nBut are genes or life experiences more important in shaping your appearance and personality? Scientists are studying twins to find out. One set of twins occurs every 70 births---some are identical and others are non-identical twins. Identical twins are special because they share exactly the same genes and often the same environment. Non-identical twins are more like ordinary brothers and sisters.\nSome identical twins have been adopted and brought up in different homes. With identical genes but a different home environment, scientists can study twins to see how much a particular feature depends on the genes we inherit. For example, we know that eye problems, like short-sightedness, are mostly genetic. But resistance to pain is largely dependent on experiences. Genes also influence our eating habits. Identical twins brought up apart often like to eat at the same time of day and feel full after eating the same amount. Non-identical twins in similar circumstances have more varied eating habits. Identical twins are also more likely to follow the same patterns for marriage and divorce than non-identical twins.\nScientists are trying to identify the different genes that influence our behaviour. Some people are thrill-seekers and get into risk-taking and adventurous activities. They take up extreme sports like bungee jumping and possibly take...\nQuestion: According to the passage,   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"identical twins are genetically the same\"?",

But you will find, as you read this book, that\nalthough pirates can be murderous and treacherous ,they can also be cowardly, superstitious, and easily led. As it turns out, that is fortunate for Jim Hawkins.\n    It's a brilliant story. Billy Bones, a retired seaman, comes to live at the Admiral Benbow inn. Jim is just a boy, but he can see that Billy Bones is a nervous man, always on the look-out for strangers arriving at the inn. And well he might be nervous, because he carries with him in his battered old sea-chest a map drawn by Captain Flint himself giving the whereabouts of all Flint's buried treasure! Captain Flint! -the most feared pirate ever to travel the high seas.\n    Well,Flint is dead, but there are plenty of men who served with Captain Flint still alive who will feel they have a fair claim to the treasure. The map, though, ends up in the possession of Jim Hawkins---(it's a near thing, read the book to see how that happens)\n    Jim tells the secret in the local doctor, who quickly joins forces to acquire a ship and crew to sail for Treasure Island\n    There's a famous scene where Jim, hiding in the apple barrel on deck, discovers that mutiny is planned. It's a bad moment. The numbers suggest that the pirates are going to have it all their own way. There are nineteen mutineers and seven honest men, including Jim.     And now, you will have to read the book for yourself. This is a fantastic tale of cheat, bravery and cowardice. I don't know how things would have turned out if it hadn't been for Jim Hawkins. For it is Jim who single-handedly steals the Hispaniola from under the very noses of the pirates and sails her round the island to a secret beaching place.\n    And do you know what happens to Long John Silver, the greatest double-crosser of them all?

        "Article: Plants that live in the rainforest have adapted in amazing ways to several very difficult conditions. This means that the plant has changed something in its \"body\" or \"habits\" to make it easier to survive in difficult conditions. There are several conditions they have had to adapted to. First, the soil of the forest floor is shallow. Also, the soil of the rainforest is not very rich, or easy to grow in. Next is the problem of very heavy rain which continues over a large part of the year. Finally, many plants of the rainforest are food for animals that live there.\nThe biggest problem that rainforest plants have to adapt to is the lack of sunlight in the rainforest's lower levels. Plants have adapted to this problem in several ways. Many plants have very large leaves. The large leaf is helpful because it has a bigger surface area. The bigger surface area a leaf has, the more sunlight it can absorb. The canopy trees  adapt by growing to be 100 feet tall so that their leaves can grab all available sunlight. Other plants called lianas   have adapted by rooting themselves in the soil of the forest floor and growing up the trees until they reach the canopy layer. Still other plants, such as epiphytes, have adapted by growing directly on the trees' trunks and branches in the canopy and understory layers of the rainforest.\nAn adaptation to the large amounts of rainfall that many rainforest plants have is called \"drip tips\". Their leaves are tapered  to a sharp point at the end. This allows water to run off the leaf quickly. There are many other adaptations that rainforest plants have made to their environment. These will be discussed in detail, as we investigate the plants of the rainforest!\nQuestion: What would be the best title of the passage?\nYes or no, is the answer \"How Do Plants Adapt to the Rainforests?\"?",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: After a fight and before forgiveness often comes an apology. But saying \"I'm sorry\" comes more easily for some people than doing that for others. A new study suggests that specific personality traits offer clues about whether a person is likely to offer a sincere apology. \nPsychologist Andrew Howell and his colleagues at Grant MacEwan University in Edmonton designed a questionnaire to measure a person's willingness to beg someone's pardon. They asked participants to indicate their level of agreement with a series of statements, such as \"My continued anger often gets in the way of me apologizing\" or \"If I think no one will know what I have done, I am not likely to apologize.\" The researchers then used the answers to determine every participant's \"proclivity  to apologize,\" and they cross-referenced  these scores with results from a variety of personality assessments.\nFrom the beginning, Howell was confident that people with high marks on compassion and agreeability would be willing apologizers -- and the study results confirmed his hypothesis . But the experiment also turned up some surprising traits of the unrepentant .\nPeople with low self-esteem, for example, were less inclined to apologize, even though they probably feel bad after a conflict. Unlike people who experience guilt about a specific action and feel sorry for the person they have wronged, individuals who experience generalized shame may actually be feeling sorry for themselves.\nIn contrast, \"people who are sure of themselves have the capacity to confess to wrongdoing and admit it,\" Howell suggests. But just the right amount of self-esteem is the key. The study also found that narcissists -- people who, in Howell's words, \"are very egocentric, with an overly grand view of themselves\" -- were reluctant to offer an apology.\nThe researchers were most surprised to find that a strong sense of justice was negatively correlated with a willingness to apologize, perhaps suggesting that contrition  and an \"eye for an eye\" philosophy are incompatible ....\nQuestion: What kind of people are more likely to apologize?\nOptions: A: Intelligent people.\nB: Confident people.\nC: People valuing fairness.\nD: People feeling sorry for themselves.",

As time went by, I found myself so good at running that sometimes, I even forgot how many rounds I ran around the playground.\nThanks to all this practice, I was able to win the 5thplace in short course marathon game at 'BASF Yeosu Site Athletic Competition' held in October 2002. This event inspired me to take part in public short-course marathon games such as 10km, 20km and half-course competitions. Finally, in May 2003, I was able to complete a full course   marathon for the first time of my life. My next challenge was the Boston Marathon race, which is the world's oldest and most famous marathon races. To qualify for the Boston Marathon, one should meet the designated time standard of their age group at a certified marathon. So I took part in ChunCheon Marathon in Korea. I had to finish the full coursewithin 3 hours and 30 minutes to meet the time standard for my age group (45 to 49 years old). But to my pleasant surprise, I recorded 3 hours 22 minutes, which is 25 minute faster than my previous best record!\nIn April 2004, I was finally able to go to Boston. I was very pleased and proud because I could play a role to promote BASF all across the world through this sport. And it really happened! When I ran in the Boston Marathon wearing BASF logo , people along the streets rooted for me shouting 'BASF! BASF!'. I was very touched and so proud of my company.

A recent survey shows that companies like graduates in such fields as business and health care who can go to work immediately with very little on-the-job training.\nThat's especially true of booming fields that are challenging for workers. At Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, for example, bachelor's degree graduates get an average of four or five job offers with salaries ranging from the high teens to the low 20s and plenty of chances for rapid advancement. Large companies, especially, like a background of formal education coupled with work experience. But in the long run, too much specialization doesn't pay off. Business, which has been flooded with MBAs, no longer considers the degree an automatic stamp of approval. The MBA may open doors and command a higher salary initially, but\n.\nAs further evidence of companies gradually losing faith in specialized degrees, Michigan State's Scheetz mentions a pattern in hiring practices. Although companies tend to take on specialists as new hires, they often seek out generalists for middle and upper-level management.  \"They want someone who isn't constrained by details to look at the big picture,\" says  Scheetz. This sounds like a formal statement that you approve of the liberal-arts  graduates. Time and again labor-market analysts mention a need for talents that liberal-arts majors are assumed to have: writing and communication skills, organizational skills, open-mindedness and adaptability, and the ability to analyze and solve problems. David Birch, manager of the Boston Red Sox, claims he does not hire anybody with an MBA or an engineering degree, \"I hire only liberal-arts people because they have a less-than-canned way of doing things,\" says Birch.\nFor a liberal-arts degree, students focus on some basic courses that include literature, history, mathematics, economics, science, human behavior--plus a computer course or two.

Anders Ericsson of the University of Florida and his team, based on a survey of a violin class in a college of music, have found that the students whose levels are rated as \"A\" have spent on average over 10,000 hours on violin-practice, those with level B a bit less than 8,000 hours, and those with average or lower levels no more than 5,000 hours.\nThe result of the survey is widely preferred because it suggests that practice makes perfect, that is, the distinction between \"excellent\" and \"good\" lies more in hard work than in natural intelligence. Malcolm Gladwell points out in his latest book Outliers: The Story of Success: \"Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good.\" Besides, he thinks IQ plays little part in the formation and development of ability. \"When one has an IQ of 120,\" writes he, \"what is beyond it does not make an evidential difference in real life.\" \nHowever, scientists' experimental results are quite different from the psychologists'. Their findings show success in many areas depends on intelligence --- and not a little. David Lubinski and Camilla Benbow of Vanderbilt University, with their research group, carried out a milestone research. They selected from Youth Talented Search 2000 teenagers of or under 13 whose SAT results ranked top1%. After tracking the achievements the 2,000 \"wonder children\" made in academy and career, Lubinski and Benbow's group found that those ranking top 1% have more possibility (averagely by two to four times) to get a doctor's degree, a certificate, and publish academic theses and works than those ranking top 9%. As a conclusion, it's a great advantage in the real world to have a high IQ.\nQuestion: Psychologists apply violin-practice as an example to support the idea that   _  .\nOptions: A: common people have more chances to become skilled\nB: practice plays a key role in the development of ability\nC: a man's ability has little to do with one's intelligence\nD: even a high IQ man can not succeed without practice",

        "A team of researchers in the UK has shown that children who were taken to the library more often and owned more books at two years old achieved higher scores in school tests when they began primary school. The research also showed that although social background has a noticeable effect on a child's readiness for school, attending pre-school and having their parents teach them a wide range of activities have a positive effect---while extended exposure to television lowers their scores.\n\"One message coming through loud and clear is that how a child learns in his very early years is critical   for a smooth transition into the educational system,\" said Professor James Law. \"This is a very positive message, as it gets us away from the belief that a child's educational future is pre-determined by standard measures of socio-economic disadvantage, such as income, housing, or the mother's education.\"\nData from the study shows that children from a positive communication environment had a better expressive vocabulary by their second birthday. These children went on to achieve higher scores in language, reading and maths tests when they entered school. In the early years, the communication environment was a better predictor of children's success with language than their general social background.\nMost children develop speech and language effortlessly, but some are slow to acquire these skills and go on to struggle with literacy   and academic skills throughout their schooling.

Employers often decide to hire someone in the first three minutes of the interview. They judge you by your appearance, attitude and manners.\nA friendly smile when you walk into the room is important. A smile shows a confident and positive attitude.\nWhen you introduce yourself, make eye contact with the interviewer. Some interviewers offer a handshake. Others don't.\nTry to be as natural as possible. But pay attention to your body language. The way you sit, walk, gesture, use your voice and show feelings on your face is all part of your body language. It makes the interviewer know how you feel about yourself and the situation you are in. Are you feeling positively about yourself? Your abilities? Your interest in the job?\nSpeak clearly and loudly enough. Show interest and enthusiasm in your voice. When you speak, look at the interviewer. Also, don't say negative things about yourself, or former employer.\nListen to questions carefully. If you don't understand a question, ask the interviewer to repeat or explain politely.\nAlmost everyone is nervous in a job interview. Interviewers know that. They don't expect you to be totally calm and relaxed. But they expect you to try to control your nervousness. They expect you to show confidence in your ability to do the job.\nAt the end of the interview, thank the interviewer for her or his time.\nIt's a good idea to send a short thank-you letter right after the interview, or deliver it by hand.\nPhone the company if you have not heard anything after one week. Ask if they have made a decision about the job.\nGood luck!\nQuestion: We pay attention to our body language because   _  .\n- it is needed by our employer\n- we need it to improve our feelings\n- it can help us feel about the employer\n- it can help us win the employer's impression",

Being the cautious type, I  fancied a reliable brand. So I went on the Net, spent 15 minutes reading product reviews on good  websites, wrote down the names of three top recommendations and headed for my nearest big  friendly camera store. There in the cupboard was one of the cameras on my list. And it was on   special offer. Oh joy. I pointed at it and asked an assistant, \"Can I have one of those? \" He looked   perturbed . \"Do you want to try it first?\" he said. It didn't quite sound like a question. \"Do I need to?\" I replied, \"There's nothing wrong with it.\" This made him look a bit offended and I started to feel bad. \"No, no. But you should try it,\" he said encouragingly, \"compare it with the others.\nI looked across at the others: shelves of similar cameras placed along the wall, offering a wide range of slightly different prices and discounts, with each company selling a range of models based around the same basic box. With so many models to choose from, it seemed that I would have to spend hours weighing X against Y, always trying to take Z and possibly H into account at the same time. But when I had finished, I would still have only the same two certainties that I had entered the store with: first, soon after I carried my new camera out of the shop, it would be worth half what I paid for it; and second, my wonderful camera would very quickly be replaced by a new model.\nBut something in the human soul whispers that you can beat these traps by making the right choice, the clever choice, the wise choice. In the end, I agreed to try the model I had chosen. The assistant seemed a sincere man. So I let him take out my chosen camera from the cupboard, show how it took excellent pictures of my fellow shoppers... and when he started to introduce the special features, I interrupted to ask whether I needed to buy a carry-case and a memory card as well. Why do we think that new options still offer us anything new? Perhaps it is because they offer an...\nQuestion: It can be inferred from the passage that in the writer's opinion,   _  .\nOptions: A: we waste too much money on cameras\nB: cameras have become an important part of our daily life\nC: we don't actually need so many choices when buying a product\nD: famous companies care more about profit than quality",

It will also be a great idea to practice speaking and writing in business English. If a university offers a course on business English, it will be a good idea to take the class. Reading, writing and speaking English is necessary to start a business.\nBusiness English is different from asking where to find the nearest hotel. There are classes you can take to help you but there are things that you can learn on your own. Vocabulary and grammar are a good place to start with. You need to know what words mean. Later, try to pronounce the words and then look them up in the dictionary. Try using them in a sentence and ask someone who is good at English to help you. Once you have an understanding of English, you can use it in business English.\nIn business you will have to learn such things as taking messages, answering the phones with proper words and communicating with your co-workers. You may have to learn how to make travel plans. Business English is very different than spoken English. Grammar is the same but you have to learn things like expressing yourself in a proper manner or maybe making a report in your office.\nIf you are working in the customer service sector  , you really have to learn business English. Dealing with the public is sometimes more important than asking your boss for a raise  . Most businesses offer training classes and some companies offer classes on how to do the job with proper business English.\nQuestion: The following language skills are mentioned of business English EXCEPT   _  .\n- listening\n- reading\n- speaking\n- writing",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: It is winter in many parts of the world. For some areas, that means snow. Maybe even lots of snow. If you don't have to drive in it or remove it, snow can be very beautiful. When snow covers everything around you, the world looks like a \"winter wonderland\". That is the name of a very popular song about winter. Richard Smith and Felix Bernard wrote the song back in 1934. There are hundreds of recordings of this happy song.\nBut winter is not always such a beautiful and happy time. It's cold outside. You try hard to keep warm. The days are darker and shorter. The sun rarely shines. The leaves on the trees are brown. It isn't surprising that some people are sad in winter. And some people dream about being somewhere else where it's warm and pretty--like the state of California. The Mamas and the Papas recorded this famous song \"California Dreaming\".\nDuring the 1960s, many other famous rock groups released songs about winter. Here is a poetic song by Simon and Garfunkel called \"A Hazy Shade of Winter\". They sing about life and hope and possibilities.\nIn 1968, the group Blood, Sweat and Tears recorded this gentle, sad song about winter. They sing about a lost love and forgotten memories in \"Sometimes in Winter\".\nIn the early 1990s, Tori Amos wrote and recorded the beautiful song called \"Winter\". She enjoyed singing about winter when she was a child.\nFinally, on a happier note comes this song written and recorded by Fountains of Wayne in 2003. They sing about a snowstorm in a New England town. Nothing unusual there. But instead of being sad or tense about the snow, they write a song about it.\nQuestion: Which of the songs can bring us hope of life?\nOptions: A: Winter Wonderland.\nB: California Dreaming.\nC: A Hazy Shade of Winter.\nD: Sometimes in Winter.",

It is now becoming increasingly difficult to buy anything that is not done up in beautiful wrapping.\nThe package itself is of no interest to the shopper, who usually throws it away immediately. Useless wrapping accounts for much of the refuse put out by the average London house-hold each week  So why is it done? Some of it, like the cellophane on meat, is necessary, but most of the rest is simply competitive selling.  This is absurd.Packaging is using up valuable energy and resources and polluting the environment.\nRecycling is already happening with milk bottles which are returned to the dairies , washed out, and refilled. But both glass and paper are being threatened by the growing use of plastic. More dairies are experimenting with plastic bottles.\nThe trouble with plastic is that it does not rot  Some environmentalists argue that the only solution to the problem of ever increasing plastic containers is to throw away plastic altogether in the shops, a suggestion unacceptable to many producers who say there is no alternative   to their handy plastic packs.\nIt is evident that more research is needed into the recovery and re-use of various materials  and into the cost of collecting and recycling containers rather than producing new ones.  Unnecessary packaging, intended to be used just once, and make things look better so more people will buy them, is clearly becoming increasingly absurd  But it is.not so much a question of throwing away packaging as using it wisely.What is needed now is a more advanced approach  to using scarce resources for what is, after all,  a  ly unimportant function.\nQuestion: Packaging is important to producers because  _  .\nOptions: A: it is easy to use it again\nB: they want to attract more shoppers\nC: shoppers are all interested in beautiful packaging\nD: packaged things will not go rotten",

        "Article: In 2006, the UK government started to allow universities in England and Wales to charge British students tuition fees. More than 80 percent of students in England and Wales now take out a student loan in order to go to university. They use the loan    to pay for tuition fees, books and living expenses. Although the interest on student loans is quite low, it begins as soon as the student receives the loan. The average student in England and Wales now graduates from university with debts of around PS12,000. Students of medicine usually have debts of more than PS20,000. That is a lot of money. It means graduates cannot afford to buy a house for many years. They even struggle to pay rent on a flat, because they have to start paying back the student loan after graduating. If you start to earn over PS15,000 a year, the government takes repayments directly from your monthly salary. Is it any surprise, therefore, that the average British person does not leave their parents' home until they are 30 years old?\nYou might think that a British person with a degree will find it easy to get a well-paid job. However, most people in white-collar jobs seem to have a degree these days, so there is a lot of competition. Also, British companies tend to value work experience over a piece of paper. Like everyone else, graduates usually have to start at the bottom and work their way up. That can be very frustrating for them, since they are often over-qualified for the work they are doing. While at university, they have dreams of getting an exciting, challenging job. Therefore, life after university ends up being quite disappointing for a lot of graduates.\nAll of the above is beginning to make British people question whether a university degree is really worth the money.\nQuestion: We can infer from the passage   _\nYes or no, is the answer \"Having a degree doesn't get aBritish person a good job\"?",

Welcome to Generation Supergirl - the young women who are supposed to have everything.\nUnlike their grandmothers, they don't have to fight for their right to be heard. Unlike their mothers, they are confident they can have the career without sacrificing the home life.\nRecord numbers of them are achieving top grades, heading to the best universities and on to great jobs.\nBut are all these opportunities making them happy? According to a new book, Supergirls Speak Out: Inside the Secret Crisis of Over-Achieving Girls, the answer is no.\nAs the book's 21-year-old author, Liz Funk, explains: Their search for perfection has turned them into stressed-out women who are at risk of eating disorders, depression and even suicide .\nSo why have so many teenage girls come to the conclusion that anything short of perfection is failure?\nStephen Hinshaw, professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, believes that they are suffering from the weight of expectations: society's, their parents', and most crucially , their own.\nThey are constantly bombarded by \"perfect\" celebrity(, ). Articles about how to have the perfect career and perfect life appear to be everywhere.\nSo it is hardly surprising that increasing numbers of young women are unable to cope and are unsure of just who they are. \"Many teenage girls have no intrinsic sense of their own worth,\" says Funk. \"Instead, they see themselves in terms of how they look, how they are seen, what they've achieved.\"\nTeenage girls believe that they must be all things to all people. They must be good at \"girl\" stuff-cultivating relationships and being beautiful - as well as being good at \"guy\" stuff - competing aggressively both at college and in the workplace.\nAccording to Funk, teenage girls need to recognize that \"you don't have to be successful at everything.\" \"Young women should take time for themselves and think about what matters to them, or enjoy life for what it is,\" she said.\nQuestion: It can be inferred from the article that Generation Supergirl   _  .\nOptions: A: tries to make its voice heard\nB: is under great pressure to succeed\nC: turns out to be the happiest generation\nD: struggles to balance work and life",

After the Taliban began attacking girl schools in Swat, Malala gave a speech in Peshawar, Pakistan, in September 2008. The title of her talk was, \"How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education?\"\nWhen she was 14, Malala and her family learned that the Taliban had issued a death threat against her. Though Malala was frightened for the safety of her father----an anti-Taliban activist-she and her family initially felt that the fundamentalist group would not actually harm a child.\nOn October 9, 2012, on her way home from school, a man boarded the bus Malala was riding in and demanded to know which girl was Malala. When her friends looked toward Malala, her location was given away. The gunman fired at her, hitting Malala in the left side of her head. Two other girls were also injured in the attack.\nDespite the Taliban's threats, Yousafzai remains a firm advocate for the power of education. On October 10, 2013, in acknowledgement of her work, the European Parliament awarded Yousafzai the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. That same year, she was nominated   for a Nobel Peace Prize. She didn't win the prize, but was named a nominee again in March 2014.\nMalala Yousafzai's Speech at the United Nations (Excerpt)\nDear brothers and sisters, do remember one thing. Malala Day is not my day. Today is the day of every woman, every boy and every girl who have raised their voice for their rights. There are hundreds of human rights activists and social workers who are not only speaking for human rights, but who are struggling to achieve their goals of education, peace and equality.Thousands of people have been killed by the terrorists and millions have been injured.I am just one of them.\n...\nDear sisters and brothers, now it's time to speak up.\nSo today, we call upon the world leaders to change their strategic policies in favour of...\nQuestion: Malala was shot for the reason that   _  .\n- she didn't behave herself on the bus\n- she fought against the Taliban\n- she appealed for girls' rights to education\n- her father was an anti-Taliban activist",

Now, four scientists say they have discovered something in lava that will help do this. They did the research on Mount Unzen on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. \nMount Unzen exploded in November, 1990. Since then, more explosions have killed 43 people and destroyed the homes of more than 2,000 others. The volcano is still active today. \nThe scientists say the lava of the volcano contains high level of an element ,which is a sign of the presence of the lava from deep in the earth, not from the surface. They say it shows that the lava coming directly from inside the earth is connected with huge explosions instead of smaller ones. \nThe scientists examined the lava from 18 explosions of Mount Unzen that took place during many thousands of years. They also studied the lava from other volcanoes in the area that are older than Mount Unzen. The lava studied came from both large and small explosions. The scientists found that large explosions contained more of the element than small ones. The scientists say if they had known this two years earlier, they could have warned the people living in the area near Mount Unzen and saved many lives.\nQuestion: Scientists have searched for a long time in order to   _  .\n- tell whether a volcano explosion will be small or large\n- tell whether a volcano explosion will be worthy or not\n- tell the number of active volcanoes in the world\n- find if there is any volcano in Japan",

        "A person steps on what seems like solid ground but discovers with horror that the ground is giving way underfoot. The person struggles desperately but is trapped. There is no escape. Slowly the person sinks deeper and at last is gone. The solid ground was solid only in appearance. It was actually quicksand, which is a deep mass of fine sand mixed with water.\nHow is quicksand formed? Water pushes up from below the surface and is held by the sand. The grains of sand are forced apart by the water. They cannot hold any weight. The subsurface water may have come from a spring, a river, or a stream. Sometimes pools of water near beaches become filled with sand. When the soil under these pools does not allow for good drainage , the sand can become stretches of quicksand.\nIs it true that a person who steps into quicksand is doomed to die? No, for people have fought their way from quicksand to firm land again. It is panic  that creates the condition that can result in death, for the more a person struggles, the worse matters become. Quick movements will make the sand yield for a time, but then it rushes back and settles solidly around the body.\nPeople trapped in quicksand should either lie back with arms outstretched, or not move at all. When the weight of the sand around his body has displaced equals that person's weight, the victim will stop sinking. With feet held still, and with slow movements of the arms, as in the backstroke  in swimming, people have managed to roll to safety and reach firm ground.\nThe passage mainly tells about   _  .\nA) what solid ground looks like\nB) the nature of quicksand\nC) stepping into quicksand\nD) escaping from quicksand",

Are they the result of cooperation, a way in which one pair signals to others that they've got it together? Or are they the result of conflict, evolving to avoid one partner's song interfering with the other's?\nA study of duetting in Peruvian warbling antbirds  suggests that it might be a little of both, and that context is everything. Joseph A. Tobias and Nathalie Seddon of the University of Oxford show in Current Biology that sexual conflict can cause the female of a pair that normally cooperates to \"jam\" the male's song by singing over it.\nThe researchers exposed antbird pairs to recorded songs of other antbirds and monitored the songs the pairs produced. In one experiment, they played the songs of an intruding pair. In this case, the resident pair \"both are likely to lose their territory, so both should cooperate,\" Dr. Tobias said. And they do. They produce a coordinated duet that in effect tells the intruders to keep away.\nBut when the researchers played the song of a single female, the pair behaved differently. \"You'd expect the resident female to be highly motivated to defend her position in the partnership,\" Dr. Tobias said. And that's what occurs. The male sings its heart out, flirting  with the single female, and the female of the pair does its best to interfere with the song by singing over it, apparently to make her mate less attractive to the other female.\n\"It's clear that the male doesn't like what she's doing,\" Dr. Tobias said. The behavior \"breaks up what is otherwise a very cooperative situation into a more complicated signal,\" he added.\nIt's the first evidence of this kind of signal jamming among pairs, Dr. Tobias said.\nAnd in that it leads the male to alter its song to avoid the female's interfering notes, it shows that this kind of conflict could, over a long period, drive the evolution of coordinated song.\nQuestion: Why did the female bird sing according to Paragraph 4?\n- It wanted to show its singing talent to the partner.\n- It aimed at keeping the partnership with the male.\n- It wanted to frighten the other females.\n- It wanted to make her mate more attractive.",

        "Article: Every family with kids has seen its share of arguments, shouting and complaining. It turns out that all those conflicts serve an important purpose in the development of children . Saying \"no\" followed by a bad temper, just may be an unavoidable part of growing up. And _ . These are the first steps toward independence. Even young children have to challenge their parents sometimes. Studies have shown the following:\n*Although stressful, conflicts are beneficial for children.\n*Learning to manage conflicts is necessary for a child's development.\n*Conflicts during the preschool years occur because children desire more attention than parents can or should give.\nIf you understand why conflicts occur, it can minimize the conflicts between you and your children. Conflict is a child's attempt to develop a sense of self and how he or she learns to express his or her needs and ideas. Parents develop and drive this independence by putting children to the outside world both formally and informally.\nConflicts can grow out of a difference of opinion or might just be a way to blow off steam . In rare situations, constant conflicts between parents and children can indicate a deeper emotional problem. Consult your doctor if this seems to be your situation.\nIt's important to offer your child choices, which should be determined by age and developmental level. The more responsible a child is, the more choices he or she gets in reward. You can threaten your child with punishment, but often offering a choice will better improve angry situations. Consequences and rewards should have some meaning to your child.\nOften a child's adverse reaction when he or she hears the word \"no\" can be avoided by giving the child an explanation as to why you have refused his or her request.\nQuestion: What can be concluded from the passage?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Communication can reduce conflicts between parents and children.\"?",

However, we will try to introduce you to some of the more important cultural differences.\nPersonal Space\nWhen two people are talking to each other, they tend to stand a distance apart. Each person has an invisible boundary   around their body into which other people may not come.\nInterestingly,the average personal distance varies from culture to culture. Americans tend to require more personal space than in other cultures. So if you try to get too close to an American during your conversation, he or she will feel that you are \"in their face\" and will try to back away.\nTry to avoid physical contact while you are speaking, since this may also lead to _ .\nTipping \nRestaurants do not include a service charge in the bill, so you should tip the waiter 15% of the total bill. If service is slow or particular bad, some Americans will tip only 10%. If service is particularly good, it is appropriate to tip 20%. If service is so bad that you will never eat in the restaurant again, leave two cents. It tells the waiter that you haven't forgotten to leave a tip. Tipping is only appropriate in restaurants which offer table service. You do not tip the cashier in a fast food restaurant.\nGestures\nTo wave goodbye or hello to someone, raise your hand and wave it from side to side, not front to back. Wave the whole hand, not just the fingers. Waving the hand front to back or the fingers up and down means \"no\", \"stop\", or \"go away'. Holding your hand up with the palm facing forward but no movement means \"stop\".\nIf you want to point at an object, extend the index finger and use it to point at the object. It is not polite to point at people.\nAlthough showing your fist with the thumb up or your open hand with the tips of the thumb and index finger together forming an \"O\" means \"OK\", these are stereotypes  . Americans understand these gestures, but they are mainly used by actors in movies, not in real life.\nQuestion: If an American to whom you are speaking backs away a little, you'd better   _  .\nAnswer:",

I guess that would have been when I was about six or seven years old, just several weeks or maybe a month before the orphanage  turned me into an old man. \n     I would get up every morning at the orphanage, make my bed just like the little soldier that I had become and then I would get into one of the two straight lines and march to breakfast with the other twenty or thirty boys who also lived in my dormitory. \n     After breakfast one Saturday morning I returned to the dormitory and saw the house parent chasing the beautiful monarch butterflies who lived by the hundreds in the bushes scattered around the orphanage. \n     I carefully watched as he caught these beautiful creatures, one after another, and then took them from the net and then stuck straight pins through their head and wings, pinning them onto a heavy cardboard sheet. \n     How cruel it was to kill something of such beauty. I had walked many times out into the bushes, all by myself, just so the butterflies could land on my head, face and hands so I could look at them up close. \n     When the telephone rang the house parent laid the large cardboard paper down on the back cement step and went inside to answer the phone. I walked up to the cardboard and looked at the one butterfly who he had just pinned to the large paper. It was still moving about so I reached down and touched it on the wing causing one of the pins to fall out. It started flying around and around trying to get away but it was still pinned by the one wing with the other straight pin. Finally its wing broke off and the butterfly fell to the ground and just trembled. \n     I picked up the torn wing and the butterfly and I spat on its wing and tried to get it to stick back on so it could fly away and be free before the house parent came back. But it would not stay on him.\nQuestion: What is the author's attitude towards the house parent's pinning some butterflies on the cardboard?\nAnswer:",

        "Article: A lot of people are afraid of spiders . One would even avoid walking in grass . And if he thought the spider was in the room or house, he would have to leave the house for days. In fact, fear of spiders is a type of disorder called specific phobia , one of the most common anxiety disorders, which annoys about 7% of the population, a study says. Common specific phobias also include fear of blood, needles, snakes, flying and enclosed spaces.\nThe Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine tried the \"exposure Therapy \", which was small, done on 12 adults, but all of them held or petted the spider afterward. One participant celebrated by getting a spider tattoo  after having been unable to even look at photos of spiders.\nThis is the first study to document the immediate and long-term brain changes after treatment and to illustrate how the brain recognizes long-term to reduce fear as a result of the therapy.  Every one would come in thinking: I am going to be the one who can't do this . There is no way ,\"Haunter ,author of the study ,says \"They were impressed by the end.\"\nIn therapy lasting two or three hours, which is different for each person, the participants were taught that troublesome thoughts about spiders were untrue.\" \"They thought the spiders might be capable of jumping out of the cage and on to them,\" Hauner says.\nExposure therapy gets its name from exposing a patient to what he fears, says Todd, research assistant professor: \"A lot of it about dispelling people's beliefs. You can get significant changes in a short period of time\".\nQuestion: Which of the following is true about the people with \"specific phobia?\"\nYes or no, is the answer \"They have a sense of scare about something.\"?",

But the problem is not in the number of students, a new report says. The report is called \"Turning the Tide -- Making Caring Common.\"\nThe report argues that the process schools use to choose students causes major problems. David Hawkins is the Executive Director for Educational Content and Policy. He says that most colleges and universities require many things from students when they apply.\nSchools usually require an essay describing a student's interests or why they want to study at that school. The schools also ask for letters from teachers describing why a student is a good candidate. But, Hawkins says, schools are most concerned with a student's high school grades and standardized test results. \nThe Education Conservancy is an organization that fights to make higher education equal and available. Lloyd Thacker is the Executive Director of the Education Conservancy, saying that the college admission process has changed a lot.\n\"Over the past 30 years, college admissions have become more complex.\" He says that ranking systems for colleges and universities are a big part of the problem.\nU.S. News and World Report is a media company that creates a list of what it calls \"America's Best Colleges.\" The company bases the list on information collected from colleges and universities across the country. This information includes results of standardized tests like the SAT from all of a school's students. Higher average test results help put schools higher on the list.\nThacker claims, \"Too many students are learning to do whatever it takes in order to get ahead, even if that means sacrificing their own individuality, their health, their happiness and behavior...\"\n\"The impact on students and on parents is that...\nQuestion: The media company ranks the schools on the basis of  _  .\n- peoples' attitude towards the schools\n- employment rate of its graduates\n- the schools' teaching quality\n- information like test results",

However, some of my students are tired of doing so, thinking that it is both hard and useless. They argue that it takes a long time to recite a text from memory and text itself never appears in a test paper.\nIn my opinion, it naturally takes time to recite a text, but it is worth doing so. When you are able to recite a text, you are sure to be familiar with the words and expressions. When you need them in reading or writing or doing exercises, they will come to your mind quickly, and so you will give quick response to all kinds of language situation. How can we say that it is useless?\nBesides, many students complain that they soon forget what they were once able to recite. This is true, but you don't need to worry. While you are reading and forgetting the texts, your language   level is being raised. Sure you don't remember your Chinese texts that you once read in the primary school, but now you are able to read novels and newspaper. So, recitation of the texts will help you improve your language ability.\nQuestion: The writer often asks his students to recite the texts,   _  .\nOptions: A: But they don't like to do so\nB: And they are eager to do so.\nC: But they wrote a letter to the Department of the Education reporting the thing.\nD: But they do more exercises instead of reciting the texts.",

He decided to send his mother some roses.\nHe went into the shop and saw a young man talking to the florist. \"How many roses can I get for six dollars, ma'am?\" the boy asked. The florist tried to explain that roses were expensive.

This is correct because life teaches us what is correct to do and what is not.\nLet's consider a mistake that one has made while trying to learn to drive. It is true that, for a beginner, it is common to make mistakes, but after doing something wrong once, twice or three times, it is quite impossible to make the same mistake a fourth time. Everyone tries their best in order to improve their skills and they will be very pleased to notice that these improvements really happen.\nOn the other hand, being successful in everything he does, one cannot know what failure means. He would always see only the best side of things and it would be difficult for him to face the difficulties to come in the future. Here we can mention the case of a very successful football player, who has known what fame   is from the very beginning of his career. We have to admit that most of his luck originates from the great talent that he was born with. But some fellow players can also work to achieve the same thing because they make mistakes in their games and they learn from each mistake that they make.\nIn the end, we can say that one needs to make mistakes in life in order to better appreciate things. And at the same time, mistakes teach us how important it is to fight for something we wish for in life. Of course, moments of happiness will come in return when we see the changes or improvements.\nQuestion: What is the author's attitude towards someone that is always successful at something?\nAnswer:",

They had been planted by a very old gardener who took care that they would all grow up to be straight and healthy. However, the area was hit by strong winds, and the little trees preferred to avoid the annoying winds, so they bent  their trunks   and branches to protect themselves.\nThe old man, knowing they could never grow well like this, decided to straighten them out, and spent many hours tying their tiny trunks to supporting poles , hoping his beloved trees would understand he was doing this for their own good. But those naughty trees disliked all the wind. They always avoided the gardener's help by bending themselves, hiding from the wind. One of those trees, one standing right in the middle of the forest, forced itself to grow up straight, patiently bearing the annoying wind.\nThree years passed, and the old man died. And from then on the trees could grow however they liked, bending from the wind just as they pleased, with no one bothering them about it. All, that was, except the single straight tree in the center of the forest, who decided to grow up just as a tree should.\nBut as the forest grew, and the trees got thicker and stronger, they began to hear cracks  from inside. Their branches and trunks needed to keep growing, but the trees were so twisted that the growth they were experiencing only brought them pain and suffering.\nAnd it was a place with a special beauty since, right in its center, surrounded by thousands of short twisted trees, rose one impressive tree that was long and straight like no others. And that tree, the only one that never cracked, continued growing, without a worry for the changeable wind.\nQuestion: Why did the trees bend their trunks and branches?\nOptions: A: Because the gardener often touched them.\nB: Because the wind were not strong.\nC: Because they protected themselves from being destroyed.\nD: Because they were very shy and afraid to meet the wind.",

That's not a  _ , folks,and I have not lost my mind. It is good to make mistakes, and here's why.\nFirst of all, mistakes are a clear sign that you are trying new things. It's always good to try new things because when you are trying new things you are growing. If you never try anything new, how can you improve? How can you expand? How can you innovate? The simple answer is, \"You can't.\" Look around you. With very few exceptions, either everything you see in your physical world or every single detail of every single thing is the result of someone trying something new.\nAnother good thing about mistakes is this: when you are making mistakes, you are learning. Consider this: Edison failed 10,000 times before he perfected the light bulb. When asked how he felt to fail that many times, he remarked that he hadn't failed 10,000 times, but rather had learned 10,000 things that didn't work.\nFinally, when you make a mistake you are that much closer to success. Why? Because when all is said and done, you will have tried some finite number of things before you succeeded. Every time you made a mistake you eliminated one of those things and are one step closer.\nBut this all doesn't mean that you should forge ahead with disregard for the consequences of a mistake.  Quite the contrary, when you try something new you have to be willing to set some reasonable limits so that, in the event that it doesn't work out the way you want it to, you will be in a position to try again.\nWe all have limited resources in the form of time and money, so don't blow them all on one approach to a problem. Realize that it probably won't be perfect the first time and allocate these resources appropriately so you can learn, modify, and try it again. Only by embracing and using your mistakes in this way can you make significant advances in your business and your career.\nThere is an old axiom that goes, \"If you're not making mistakes, you're not trying hard enough.\"\nSo...\nQuestion: What does the writer mainly tell us in the passage as far as mistakes are concerned?\nOptions: A: Don't be afraid of making mistakes. They are unavoidable.\nB: Try your best to make fewer mistakes. They are expensive.\nC: Don't be afraid of making mistakes. They are beneficial.\nD: The more mistakes you make, the more advances you'll make.",

Back in the old days, the idea of renting one never existed since the books are affordable or readily available in libraries. But the time has changed and with the changes in educational system and various economic challenges happening across the globe, the price of textbooks increased.\nGiven such fact, textbook renting is now a new fashion among college students. Research was made to find out if renting helps one save money and time rather than buying new textbooks and realized that it really is. Let's examine carefully further and see why renting books is a cost-effective way to still get to have your textbooks without _ too much money from your pocket.\nGives value for your money\nYou don't have to buy all of your textbooks. Those non-major subjects, are better acquired through renting. It saves one money and helps you give out the money you save on some other personal possessions you need in college.\nRenting textbooks allows you to save at least 50% off the standard retail   price for each item. You can tell, with a little research, that renting is a lot cheaper compared to buying used books aside from looking way better than the former.\nSaves time\nYou can save a great deal of time when renting a textbook. Instead of browsing your way for hours trying to look for better deals online, you can simply go to a popular book renting marketplace online and just order away. There is literally no need to skimming for hours and see where you can find a great deal. Often, the rental company gives you prepaid postage slip just to get you going and do the same when you decide to return the book.\nThis process not only saves you time, it also saves other resources like gas if you decide to go to the nearest bookstore to buy books or spend hours using electricity just to find a good deal.\nUser Friendly\nAside from being able to save money and time, renting textbooks brings convenience to all users.

Early clowns often both annoyed and delighted listeners with their comments and songs. They were not the silent performers seen in today's circus rings. Clowns  _ when the big three-ring circuses made it impossible for the audience to hear them.\nCircus clowns give performances in various ways. Walk-around clowns use an animal or something, like a huge rubber hammer, as part of their performance. A carpet clown moves around, talking with the audience and performing while the acts change in the rings. Then there are acrobatic clowns, riding clowns, juggling clowns and others. \nEverything a clown does looks easy, but it is not. Making people laugh can be hard work. Clowns must be in good physical condition to prevent injuries. Each funny move is carefully timed and well-rehearsed  . Most clowns have also been trained as acrobats, jugglers or aerial artists, and many include such skills into their acts.\nGenerally, there are three types of circus clowns--whiteface, auguste and character. Each has a special makeup and clothes. Each has a typical act as well.\nThe neat whiteface is usually a strict, in-charge character who sets up the punch line (the point of a joke) with a partner who is typically an auguste. His facial makeup is neatly detailed in red or black, and his clothes look so loose with a ruffle around the neck. \nOld circus stories have it that the auguste clown got his name from a German nickname for someone who is clumsy, acting in a careless and stupid way. The auguste wears light-coloured makeup, but white is used around the mouth and eyes, and there's a big red nose. This clown performs a great deal of humour. An oversized suit or baggy trousers allow freedom of movement for all the clumsy acts. He also wears big shoes.\nCharacter clowns perform as different characters--cowboys, grandmothers or concert conductors. The most famous character clown, however, is the tramp  .

Singaporeans, even those of the same ethnic group  , have many different first languages and cultures. For example,  within the Singaporean Chinese group, nearly a third speak English as their home language while almost half speak Standard Chinese as their home language and the rest speak various Chinese dialects   as their home language. Due to these reasons, the English fluency level of people in Singapore varies vastly from person to person.\nMost reasonably educated Singaporeans do speak Singapore Standard English, alternatively known as Educated Singapore English, which, grammatically, is not different from standard British English, with changes being limited to accent and a few borrowed words, causing few challenges to any native Britons. \nSingapore English derives   its roots from the 146 years of British colonial rule over Singapore until its independence in 1965. Before 1965, the standard form of English in Singapore had always been British English. After Singapore declared independence, English in Singapore began to take a life of its own, leading to the development of modern Singapore English.\nEnglish had been the official language of the colonial government, and when Singapore gained self-government in 1959, the local government decided to keep English as the main language in order to help develop economy. The use of English as the nation's first language serves to bridge the gap between different ethnic groups in Singapore.

        "Read the following article and select the best answer.\nArticle: As skies are filled with millions of migrating  birds, European scientists say the seasonal wonder appears to be strange: The fatter the bird, tile better it flies.\n    The results of their study led to a theory opposite to a central one of aerodynamics  , which says that the power needed to fly increases with weight.\n    For birds, obviously, the cost of flying with heavy fat is much smaller than we used to think. Researchers found that red knot wading birds double their normal body weight of 100 grams before making their twice-a-year nonstop flight between the British Isles and the Russian Arctic. Distance: 5,000 kilometers.\n    Another study in the magazine Nature measured the advantage of flying in an aerodynamic group which allows birds to save energy by flying smoothly and quietly in the lead bird' s air stream.\n    Flying in groups, their heart rates were 14.5 percent lower than flying alone, according to Henri, a French scientist. The findings help explain how birds complete difficult migrations. Researchers had thought that thinner, stronger birds would have the best chance to survive.\n    The first study suggests that building up fat to be burnt as fuel during the migration is worth more than the energy it takes to carry the additional weight.\n    In the study, researchers said their team studied the birds flown at different body weights during 28 simulated  flights. They forced a small amount of special water into the birds' bodies so that they could measure the amount of energy burnt during the flight.\nQuestion: During their migrating flight, red knot wading birds can save energy by flying\n- separately\n- alone\n- in groups\n- in pairs",

It's now 70 years after _ appeared in the film, but it still seems to hold its power especially during an economic downturn.\nThe phrase comes from a film adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's successful 1936 novelGone With the Wind. It's set in the American South and tells the story of a strong heroine, Scarlett O' Hara, who struggles to find love during the Civil War and, afterwards, of her strength in surviving the war and its hardships.\nLove story\nIn a moment of despair, Scarlett finally realizes that her love belongs to Rhett Butler. For many audiences, it is the theme of love and struggle that has kept the movie alive. While the burning of Atlanta might seem irrelevant to today's viewers, the timeless theme of love keeps its ability to touch people.\nWith a promise to her lover still in her mind, Scarlett chooses to stay in the midst of war and take care of Melanie. But her heart is broken when Rhett just walks away, leaving the woman that he once loved with cruel words, \"Frankly, dear, I don' t give a damn.\"\nGreat epic\nThe film shows the love-hate relationship of these characters, but also American history, the fall of the Confederacy and the following period of Reconstruction in the South.

        "Article: The Swiss army knife is a popular device that is recognized all over the world. In Switzerland, there is a saying that every good Swiss citizen has one in his or her pocket. But the knife had poor beginnings.\nIn the late nineteenth century, the Swiss army issued  its soldiers a gun that required a special screwdriver  to take it apart and clean it. At the same time, canned food was becoming common in the army. Swiss generals decided to issue each soldier a standard knife to serve both as a screwdriver and a can opener.\n _ was a lifesaver for Swiss knife makers, who were struggling to compete with cheaper German imports. In 1884, Carl Elsener, head of the Swiss knife manufacturer(maker) Victorinox, seized that opportunity with both hands, and designed a soldier's knife that the army loved. It was a simple knife with one big blade , a can opener, and a screwdriver.\nA few years after the soldier's knife was issued, the \"Schweizer Offizier Messer,\" or Swiss Officer's Knife, came on the market. Interestingly, the Officer's Knife was never given to those serving in the army. The Swiss army purchasers considered the new model with a corkscrew  for opening wine not \"essential for survival,\" so officers had to buy this new model by themselves. But its special multi-functional design later launched  the knife as a global brand. After the Second World War, a great number of American soldiers were stationed in Europe. And as they could buy the Swiss army knife at shops on army bases, they bought huge quantities of them. However, it seems that \"Schweizer Offizier Messer\" was too difficult for them to say, so they just called it the Swiss army knife, and that is the name it is now known by all over the world.\nQuestion: What is the main purpose of the passage?\nYes or no, is the answer \"To explain the origin of the Swiss army knife.\"?",

But Andersen, a 46-year-old father of four, wasn't expecting any trouble on the road last New Year's Eve, when he set off for a ski trip to the Bear River Mountains with nine-year-old daughter Mia, four-old son Baylor, and nine-year-old neighbor Kenya. Andersen had driven through the Canyon hundreds of times over the years.\nThe weather was fine-but the higher they drove, the more slippery the roads became. Rounding a sharp U-turn at mile marker473, Andersen saw a truck that had skated off the road and immediately tapped his brakes. In an instant, the car was sliding at 25 miles per hour toward the shoulder of the highway, then rolling down a steep ten-foot dam toward the extremely cold Logan River. As it hit the water, the car tipped toward the passenger side, hesitated, and then rolled onto its roof and sank into the river.\nThere was no time to tell the kids what to do. The crash had broken a few windows, and within seconds, the upside-down car was filled with water. \"It was frightening how fast we were completely underwater,\"remembers Andersen, a soft-spoken product development manager.\"You're thinking, is this how it's all going to end?\"\nHaving lost all sense of direction, Andersen began to search the freezing water for the kids. Mia had been right next to him in the front seat; now, in the blackness, he couldn't find her.\"I thought, if I don't get out, maybe none of us are going to get out.\" Andersen got out of his seat belt, swam through a broken window, and, deeply and quickly, breathed air at the surface. That's when he saw a group of men, about ten in all, appear at the top of the dam. One after another, they raced down into the water.

I told her I hope she could contact the bank and get things straightened out before her problem got worse.

But no, there is another truly universal fast food, the ultimate fast food. It's easy to make, easy to serve, much more varied than the hamburger, can be eaten with the hands and it's delivered to your front door or served in fancy restaurants. It's been one of America's favourite foods for over 50 years. It is, of course, the pizza.\nIt's kind of silly to talk about the moment when pizza was \"invented\". It changed over the years, but one thing's for certain--it's been around for a very long time. The idea of using pieces of flat, round bread as plates came from the Greeks. They called them \"plakuntos\" and ate them with various simple toppings such as oil, garlic , onions and herbs. The Romans enjoyed eating something similar and called it \"picea\". By about 1000 AD in the city of Naples, \"picea\" had become \"pizza\" and people were experimenting with more toppings: cheese, ham, anchovies and finally the tomato, brought to Italy from Mexico and Peru in the sixteenth century. Naples became the pizza capital of the world. In 1889, King UmbertoIand Queen Margherita heard about pizza and asked to try it. They invited pizza maker, Raffele Esposito, to make it for them. He decided to make the pizza like the Italian flag, so he used red tomatoes, white mozzarella cheese and green basil leaves. The Queen loved it and the new pizza was named \"Pizza Margherita\" in her honour.\nPizza went to America with the Italians at the end of the nineteenth century. The first pizzeria in the United States was opened in 1905 at 53 Spring Street, New York City, by Gennaro Lombardi. But the popularity of pizza really exploded when American soldiers returned from Italy after World WarII and raved about  \"that great Italian dish\". Americans are now the greatest producers and consumers of pizza in the world.\nQuestion: What's the best title of the passage?\nOptions: A: McDonald's and Pizza\nB: Global Pizza\nC: Pizza in the United States\nD: How to Make Pizza",

To match today's standard of living, it is necessary for both men and women to support the family.\nToday, women have been given bigger roles to play in society.

Since then, he has decided to choose his career as a wildlife protector. He went to school to learn more first of all. After he earned his doctor's degree, he eagerly signed up for a job studying cougars  , which once lived throughout the United States, but now live mainly in the Rocky Mountains and westward.\nThey need not only a lot of land to survive but also plenty of food and places to raise their young. But many wild areas have been divided by freeways and taken over by towns. The small wilderness areas of the Santa Ana Mountains in Southern California didn't have much room for them. And yet a few still lived there. How did they do it?\nMany big animals are disappearing. Those that survive are being trapped in shrinking patches of habitat. A patch may not have enough space or food for a cougar to survive. Scientists wondered if cougars could move from one patch to another. If so, maybe humans could preserve wildlife corridors to connect the patches, providing enough room for the animals. But no one had shown that animals use wildlife corridors in real life.\nTo see if cougars had found corridors through local suburbs and freeways, Paul and his research team studied 32 cougars for five years. They used a drug to make each cat sleep, buckled a radio collar around its neck, and let it go. Every day, Paul used an electrical device that sends and receives radio signals to find cougars, listening for radio beeps from their collars. Once or twice a week, he trailed one of the cougars all night. He traced their travels on a map. Sure enough, some of them had discovered paths from one small park land to the next.\nOne cougar became famous for his travels. He was named M6:\"M\"for Male, and\"6\"because he was the sixth one collared in the study. M6's corner of the Santa Ana Mountains wasn't large enough for him. Chino Hills State Park was not far away, but the trip was not safe. After dark, M6 used a paved vehicle underground passage to cross undera busy...\nQuestion: How did Paul's research influence the cougars according to the passage?\n- Their moving routine was made secure.\n- Their food was provided by humans.\n- Their number increased rapidly afterwards.\n- They were visited by many foreigners.",

The Bluefin 21 submarine can create a sonar map of the area to chartany wreckage on the seafloor.\nThe move comes after crews picked up a series of underwater sounds over the past two weeks that were consistent with an aircraft's black boxes.\n\"We haven't had a single detection in six days, and l guess it's time to go under water,\" said Houston.\n\"Analysis of the four signals has reduced the search area on the ocean floor.

He certainly did not consider that he took great pains over anything, he did just enough to get it right. Exactly right, of course, for as he was fond of telling his staff, \"if it's not exactly right, it's wrong\". Occasionally a worker might be sad on hearing these words, because it meant another hour or so of going over the same bit of work, correcting the mistakes which Cameron had patiently pointed out. And doing the corrections exactly right of course.\nStrangely enough, his department had the reputation for performing the highest quality work in the company, and it was seen, and not only by those who worked in the department, as a sort of elite   unit. Those programmes that had to work first time, straight out of the box, Cameron's men got those. \"It's mission   critical--give it to Cameron\" was almost a catch-phrase with his team.\nIt helped that Cameron was not merely particular about things. He wanted things done just so, not because of a personal taste, but because he had discovered through patient experimentation that this was the best way for it to be done.\nIn Cameron's dictionary, \"Take as long as you want\" meant that you could work on your task not just in office hours, but that evening, and late into the early hours of the following morning if you so desired. But the project had to be in by its completion date, and yes, done exactly right.

But occasionally you feel horrible, and you lose things and you cannot focus on your schoolwork.\nFor more than 20 years, scientists have suggested that high self-esteem   is the key to success. Now, new research shows that focusing just on building self-esteem may not be helpful. In some cases, having high self-esteem can bring bad results if it makes you less likeable or more upset when you fail at something.\n\"Forget about self-esteem,\" says Jennifer Crocker, a psychologist   at the University of Michigan, US. \"It's not the important thing.\"\nFeeling good\nCrocker's advice may sound a bit strange because it is good to feel good about yourself.\nStudies show that people with high self-esteem are less likely to be depressed, anxious, shy, or lonely than those with low self-esteem.\nBut, after reviewing about 18,000 studies on self-esteem, Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University, has found that building up your self-esteem will not necessarily make you a better person.\nHe believes that violent and wicked people often have the highest self-esteem of all. He also said: \"There's no evidence that kids with high self-esteem do better in school.\"\nProblems\nAll types of people have problems. People with high self-esteem can have big egos   that can make them less likeable to their peers , said Kathleen Vohs, a psychology professor at Columbia University.\nPeople with high self-esteem tend to think more of themselves, Vohs says. People with low self-esteem are more likely to rely on their friends when they need help.\nWhat to do\nResearchers say it is best to listen to and support other people. Find positive ways to contribute to society. If you fail at something try to learn from the experience. \"The best therapy   is to recognize your faults,\" Vohs says. \"It's OK to say, 'I'm not so good at that,' and then move on.\"\nQuestion: The new research comes to the conclusion that high self-esteem   _  .\nOptions: A: is not important at all\nB: has taken on a different meaning\nC: may not be the key to success\nD: does not help you do better at school",

But what is their most common response to seeing them again? It may seem strange,but most of the time they break down in tears.\nNow a group of psychologists from Yale University say they have found the reason why, and that crying tears of joy may well be the body's way of keeping emotional balance. \"They seem to take place when people are overtaken by strong positive emotions, and people who do this seem to recover better from those strong emotions,\" Oriana Aragon, the lead researcher said.\nAragon and her fellow psychologists looked at hundreds of participants' emotional responses to different things, including happy reunions and cute babies. Many participants said they would react in a negative or aggressive way to the positive things ---- to cry at happy moments and want to pinch a cute baby's face or even tell them \"I want to eat you up!\" But then researchers found that these people were able to calm down from strong emotions more quickly.\nThere are many other examples of times when people respond to a positive experience with a negative emotional reaction. At an exciting concert, fans scream at their idols . People who have just had a big lottery win are often in floods of tears. \"These findings advance our understanding of how people express and control their emotions, which is importantly related to mental and physical health, the quality of relationships with others, and even how well people work together.\" said Aragon.\nQuestion: Which of the following agrees with the findings of the research?\nAnswer:",

        "Article: If you haven't heard or seen anything about Road Rage in the last few months, you've probably been avoiding the media. There have been countless stories about this new and scary phenomenon, considered a type of aggressive driving. You have most likely encountered aggressive driving or Road Rage recently if you drive at all.\nWhile drunk driving remains a critical problem, the facts about aggressive driving are surely as disturbing. For instance, according to the National Highway Transportation Safety Association, 41,907 people died on the highway last year. Of those deaths, the agency estimates that about two-thirds were caused at least in part by aggressive driving behavior.\nWhy is this phenomenon occurring more than ever now, and why is it something that seemed almost nonexistent a few short years ago? Experts have several theories, and all are probably partially correct. One suggestion is sheer overcrowding. In the last decade, the number of cars on the roads has increased by more than 11 percent, and the number of miles driven has increased by 35 percent. However, the number of new road miles has only increased by 1 percent. That means more cars in the same amount of space; and the problem is magnified in urban areas. Also, people have less time and more things to do. With people working and trying to fit extra chores and activities into the day, stress levels have never been higher. Stress creates anxiety, which leads to short tempers. These factors, when combined in certain situations, can _ Road Rage.\nYou may think you are the last person who would drive aggressively, but you might be surprised. For instance, have you ever yelled out loud at a slower driver, sounded the horn long and hard an another car, or sped up to keep another driver from passing? If you recognize yourself in any of these situations, watch out!\nWhether you are getting angry at other drivers, or another driver is visibly upset with you, there are things you can do to avoid any major conflict. If you are easily influenced by Road...\nQuestion: Which of the following characterizes aggressive driving?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Shouting at another driver.\"?",

The so-called shopping method has become common practice these days, but that can put your wallet under a lot of pressure. So if you are sad and feel like shopping, don't!\nAccording to the recent study, sadness leads to self-focus   thinking. In other words, sad people are willing to spend more money on the same thing than calm people.\n\"It is the result of sadness and self-focus, and it turns out that sadness leads to an increase in self-focus,\" said Cynthia Cruder. \"What we think is that sad and self-focused people are feeling pretty bad about themselves, and one way to deal with this is buying material goods.\"\nIn a perfect situation, when you know you are sad, you should avoid  making decisions and spending money.

They would be classified to the ranks of escapee, beaten to the New World by Aboriginals   in boats.\nTo a European, this may seem like an academic argument, but to Americans it is a philosophical question about identity, Silvia Gonzales, of Liverpool University said .\nHer claims are based on skeletons found in the California Peninsula of Mexico that have skulls quite unlike the broad Mongolian features of Native Americans. These narrow-skulled people have more in common with southern Asians, Aboriginal Australians and people of the South Pacific Region.\nThe bones, stored at the National Museum of Anthropology   in Mexico City, have been carbon-dated and one is 12,700 years old, which places it several thousand years before the arrival of people from the North. \"We think there were several migration waves into the Americas at different times by different human groups,\" Dr. Gonzales said. \"The timing, route and point of origin of the first colonization of the Americas remains a most contentious topic in human evolution.\"\nBut comparisons based on skull shape are not considered conclusive by anthropologists, so a team of Mexican and British scientists, backed by the Natural Environment Research Council, has also attempted to take out DNA from the bones.

You don't have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy.\nHere are some tips for preventing weight gain and maintaining physical fitness:\nDon't skip meals.Before you leave home,have a small,low-fat meal or snack.This may help to avoid getting too excited before delicious foods.\nControl portions.Use a small plate (about 10 inches) and put aside the large ones that may encourage you to \"load up.\" You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist. Once you have your \"tasting\" serving,move away from the buffet . Doing so will make it less tempting to be eating constantly as your appetite is inspired by the sight of food.\nBegin with soup and fruit or vegetables. Fill up beforehand on water-based soup and raw fruit or vegetables. Or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you feel full.\nStick to physical activity. Don't let exercise take a break during the holidays. A 20-minute walk after a meal can help burn off excess calories.\nAvoid high-fat foods. Dishes that look oily or creamy may have a large amount of fat. Choose lean meats. Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables. Use lemon juice instead of dessert or butter.\nIf the passage appears in the newspaper,you think it should belong to   _   Column.\nA) Holidays and Festivals\nB) Health and Fitness\nC) Fashion and Frontier\nD) Student Times Club",

The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.\nAn international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, \"the worst came to the worst\". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.\nThe magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.\nMr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan.

It represents a very important victory for laborers everywhere.The holiday is a celebration of the social and economic achievements of American workers.\nMore than a century ago workers were forced to deal with harsh conditions.They were paid very little and they often worked 10-to l2-hour days.Men, women and even small children were forced to work even when they were sick.Tired of long hours and dangerous conditions,workers began organizing themselves into labor unions.On top of fighting for higher pay and shorter workdays,they also fought for the rights of children.The workers wanted employers to place limits on the age of their workers so that small children were not overworked or hurt in factories.\nA New York City carpenter named Peter McGuire is credited  for coming up with the idea for Labor Day.In 1872,after working many hours under poor conditions, McGuire _ 100,000 workers to go on strike.The workers marched through the streets of New York City,demanding a better work environment.McGuire spent a decade fighting for workers' rights.In 1882,he proposed the idea to create a special holiday for workers.On Tuesday,September 5,1882, more than 10,000 workers hit the streets of New York City for the first ever Labor Day parade.Two years later the celebration was moved to the first Monday in September.And in 1894,Congress passed a law making Labor Day a national holiday.Americans celebrated the first Labor Day holiday with a parade,picnics and fireworks.\nToday,many people hit the road to enjoy the last of their summer vacation.Others enjoy the long weekend with picnics,backyard barbecues or just rest and relaxation.However you spend Labor Day,remember that the holiday is a time to pay tribute  to the workers who have made America what it is today.\nOptions:\nA There were about 100,000 workers in New York City in 1872.\nB Labor Day became a national holiday in 1884.\nC The idea for Labor Day was first put forward by McGuire in 1872.\nD The first ever Labor Day parade was held in 1882.\nAnswer:\nD The first ever Labor Day parade was held in 1882.\nQuestion:",

Most people, and many animals, like eating it. However, the only way for them to get that honey is to find a wild bees' nest and take the honey from it. Often, these nests are high up in trees, and it is difficult to find them. In parts of Africa, though, people and animals looking for honey have a strange and unexpected helpera little bird called a honey guide.\nThe honey guide does not actually like honey, but it does like the wax   in the beehives  . The little bird cannot reach this wax, which is deep inside the bees' nest. So, when it finds a suitable nest, it looks for someone to help it. The honey guide gives a loud cry that attracts the attention of both passing animals and people. Once it has their attention, it flies through the forest, waiting from time to time for the curious animal or people as it leads them to the nest. When they\nfinally arrive at the nest, _ reaches in to get at the delicious honey as the bird patiently waits and watches. Some of the honey, and the wax, always falls to the ground, and this is when the honey guide takes its share.\nScientists do not know why the honey guide likes eating the wax, but it is very determined in its efforts to get it.

They will quickly arrive whenever a beekeeper is taking honey from his beehives, and will even enter churches when beeswax candles are being lit.",

        "Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: A recent National Public Radio program examined the disappearance of some of the first words we were probably taught - \"please\" and \"thank you.\" Other polite phrases are also disappearing. \"You're welcome\" has been replaced by \"sure,\" \"no problem,\" \"you bet\" or \"enjoy.\"\n  Are we becoming ruder, or are patterns of speech merely updating for changing times?\n  Peter Post, director of the program, argues about people stopping using \"you're welcome\". He says, \"Thank you\" is an expression of appreciation one person offers another. To respond \"No problem\" is to ignore this acceptance as really being undeserved. By responding with a simple \"you're welcome,\" Post adds, a person admits the thanks and shows appreciation for the person giving it.\n  Whatever polite vocabulary you believe is fading, sociologist Gregory E. Smith says that such fading is a sign that we're becoming ruder as a society. \"Saying please and thank you, asking permission, offering help, and following up on solutions to problems are no longer as important,\" he says. In 2011, 76 percent of people surveyed said Americans are becoming less civil.\n  But could it be that it's simply the words we're using that are changing? Actually, the principles of respect, consideration and honesty are universal and timeless, but manners do change. For example, it's important to greet people when you see them, though the form of greeting has changed over time. \"How do you do,\" for instance, became \"Hello, how are you?\" which changed into \"Hello, how are things,\" or \"How's it going?\". As for \"no problem\", if the appreciation is expressed in a sincere manner, many Americans think they do not see its use as a loss of politeness.\nQuestion: According to the text, when you meet a person for the first time,   _  .\nAnswer:",

        "Article: When next year's crop of high-school graduates arrive at Oxford University in the fall of 2009, they'll be joined by a new face: Andrew Hamilton, the 55-year-old provost  of Yale, who'll become Oxford's vice-chancellor----a position equal to university president in America.\nHamilton isn't the only educator crossing the Atlantic. Schools in France, Egypt, Singapore, etc. have also recently made top-level hires from abroad. Higher education has become a big and competitive business nowadays, and like so many businesses, it's gone global. Yet the talent flow isn't universal. High-level personnel  tend to head in only one direction: outward from America.\nThe chief reason is that American schools don't tend to seriously consider looking abroad. For example, when the board of the University of Colorado searched for a new president, it wanted a leader familiar with the state government, a major source of the university's budget. \"We didn't do any global consideration,\" says Patricia Hayes, the board's chair. The board finally picked Bruce Benson, a 69-year-old Colorado businessman and political activist  who is likely to do well in the main task of modern university presidents: fund-raising. Fund-raising is a particularlly American thing, since U.S. schools rely heavily on donations. The fund-raising ability is largely a product of experience and necessity.\nMany European universities, meanwhile, are still mostly dependent on government funding. But government support has failed to keep pace with rising student numbers. The decline in government support has made fund-raising an increasingly necessary ability among administrators  , and has hiring committees hungry for Americans.\nIn the past few years, well-known schools around the world have joined the trend. In 2003, when Cambridge University appointed Alison Richard, another former Yale provost, as its vice-chancellor, the university publicly stressed that in her previous job she had overseen \"a major strengthening of Yale's financial position.\"\nOf course,...\nQuestion: What is the chief consideration of American universities when hiring top-level administrators?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Their ability to raise funds.\"?",

        "Read the article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Today, we complete our story about the influential English writer William Shakespeare. He wrote plays and poems during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, which remain very popular today.\nDuring earlier times, people would probably have learned several ancient Roman and Greek plays. It was not unusual for writers to produce more current versions of these works. For example, in Shakespeare's play \"The Comedy of Errors\"(<<>> )Shakespeare borrowed certain details from the ancient Roman writer Plautus. For his play \"Macbeth\"(<<>> ), Shakespeare most likely used a work on Scottish history by Raphael Holinshed for information. Shakespeare might have borrowed from other writers, but the intensity of his imagination and language made the plays his own. While many plays by other writers of his time have been forgotten, Shakespeare and his art live on.\nShakespeare was also influenced by the world around him. He described the sights and sounds of London in his plays. His works include observations about political struggles, the fear of diseases, and the popular language of the city's tradesmen. Shakespeare's knowledge of the English countryside is also clear. His works include descriptions of deep forests, local flowers, and the ancient popular traditions of rural people.\nIt would be impossible to list all of the ways in which Shakespeare's works have influenced the world culture. But the first and greatest example would be his great influence on the English language. During his time, the English language was changing. Many new words from other languages were being added. Shakespeare used his sharp mind and poetic inventiveness to create hundreds of new words and rework old ones. For example, he created the noun forms of \"critic\", \"mountaineer\" and \"eyeball\". Many common expressions in English come from his plays, including \"pomp and circumstance \"from \"Othello\"(<<>> ), \"full circle \" from \"King Lear\"(<<>> ), etc. The list of cultural creations influenced by Shakespeare is almost endless. From paintings to...\nQuestion: Shakespeare's greatest influence should be on  _  .\nOptions: A: the English language\nB: paintings\nC: television\nD: music and dance",

Everywhere I looked there were smashed houses and cars turned upside down.\nThat same night Bob Templeton was driving down the same highway. He stopped to look at the disaster just as I had; only his thoughts were different than my own. Bob was the vice-president of Telemedia Communications, which owns a string of radio stations in Ontario and Quebec. He thought there must be something we could do for these people with the radio stations they had.\nThe following night I was doing another seminar in Toronto. Bob Templeton and Bob Johnson, another vice-president from Telemedia, came in and stood in the back of the room. They shared their conviction   that there had to be something they could do for the people in Barrie.\nAfter the seminar we went back to Bob's office. He was now committed   to the idea of helping the people who had been caught in the tornado.\nThe following Friday he called all the executives   at Telemedia into his office.

He said to his executives, \"How would you like to raise 3 million dollars 3 days from now in just 3 hours and give the money to the people in Barrie?\" There was nothing but silence in the room.\nFinally someone said, \"Templeton, you're crazy. There is no way we could do that.\"\nBob said, \"Wait a minute. I didn't ask you if we could or even if we should. I just asked you if you'd like to.\"\nThey all said, \"Sure we'd like to.\" He then drew a large 'T' underneath the 333.

        "I was born in a middle class family. At one time, I was a girl who was talkative and confident. Friends around me envied me that l was always keeping a smile on my face and regarded me as a little happy swallow.\n    However, things have changed with the passage of time. In 2006, I failed to get into my ideal university. But I didn't want to give up, so I was determined to retake the exam in 2007. At that time, I was confident in showing my abilities.\n    Unfortunately, things didn't go well again. I can clearly remember that it was on August 15th of 2006 that my family received a bad news from my  s. It wasn't until then that I came to realize how much of burdens I have to bear. Having heard that my elder sister suffered from mental illness, I couldn't help crying in class. Reluctant to accept the fact, I often said to myself 'God is just playing with me. It can't be true.' For this reason, I had struggled with these difficulties for a long time. During the fourth year of senior life, I almost buried myself in great grief. As a result, I had no appetite for study any more, and I even gave up. Consequently, I failed, once more.\n    Looking back to the most difficult time, from 2006 to 2007, when I had no interests and low spirits every day, I often think how silly l was then. Happily, my elder sister is getting better and better under the considerate care of my family. Apart from this, thanks to my friends, l am trying to recover quickly. Gradually, I am adjusting to life in college and get along well with new dorm-mates. \n    Everyone who hears my story would feel sorry for my experience. I need no sympathy but I would rather have more care and encouragement. I am convinced that life will be different and meaningful if I make every effort to take challenges and meet them.\nWhat does the author mean by saying \"I almost buried myself in great grief\"?\nA) She didn't want to meet anyone.\nB) She had a sorrowful mood.\nC) She didn't want to eat anything.\nD) She couldn't feel happy or hurt.",

They can round up lost children and protect those who experience unfortunate \"accidents\". Wendy Dyble, aSheetlandIslandswoman who teaches children up to age seven, made it clear to her fellow friends that she was not \"barking mad\". They obviously believed her, supporting her idea by 16 votes to 13, with a total of 63 abstentions .\nHe said big dogs could help round up children, keep them in line, lick up the milk they spill on the floor and provide the extra eyes that a teacher needs to keep order. \"A big dog would also be helpful for breaking up fights and look for lost property, like gym shoes or dolls, \" Dyble said at the conference. \"The dog will also be useful in sniffing out smells that children do not own up to,\" she added. \"It would be nice for the teacher not to have to go round sniffing each child to find the culprit .\"\nThe idea was greeted by the Dog Defense League but less so by bigger teaching unions. A spokesman for Education Secretary David Blunkett, who is blind, said his guide dog was always popular with pupils when he visited schools. The Professional Association of Teachers, with around 35,000 members, is the smallest teaching union in Britain. It has an honour for occasional strange ideas.\nEarlier this week, its annual conference here suggested stopping exams because they lead to stress and introducing selection at the age of 12 based on physical coordination and manual skill in the use of hand.\nQuestion: A spokesman for Education Secretary_.\n- once used a dog as classroom assistant\n- sang high praise for Dyble's idea\n- would employ dogs as teachers\n- benefited from dogs more than others",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: An environment group called the Food Commission is unhappy and disappointed because of the sales of bottled water from Japan. The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 \" _ \" before it reaches Western customers. \"Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK.\" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles).\nCounting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of \"food miles\" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.\nWhat is the idea of \"food miles\" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment.\nQuestion: From the passage we know that the author is most probably  _  .\nOptions: A: a supporter of free global trade\nB: a member of the Food Commission\nC: a supporter of First World food markets\nD: a member of an energy development group",

        "Article: Go to church, then have a big lunch, then go out to play while mum does the housework. That was a typical   British Sunday in the 1960s. But things now could not be more different.\nSome British sociologists recently studied the typical British Sunday. They found that people get up later and do less housework than they did 40 years ago. They are far more likely to be out shopping or enjoying themselves than cooking Sunday lunch.\nSunday mornings were busy 40 years ago. Most women caught up on their weekly housework and cooked a nice lunch. They seldom allowed themselves any \"leisure\" until afternoon, after the dishes were cleaned. Then there would be another rush to the table between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm for tea.\nBut now, Britons can have brunch   at the restaurant. Fewer people bother  to cook themselves.\n              \"You only have two free days a week. You don't want to have to waste one because there is nothing to do but watch boring TV,\" said Elizabeth Biggs, 25, a producer in London.\n\"On Saturday you are recovering from the week,\" Biggs added. \"Sundays are the last chance for the weekend -- you want to get as much as you can out of the day before you have to go back to work.\"\nIn the past, British women usually did their shopping during the week, while the husband was at work. \"Now men seem to do that as much as women,\" said Jonathan Gershuny, a professor who took part in the study.\nMen also do more housework now on Sundays. Back in the 1960s, men were far more likely to spend Sundays out of the house -- at the pub or playing football -- before lunch.\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT true?\nYes or no, is the answer \"British women did their shopping on Sundays in the past.\"?",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: However urban life strikes you, cities worldwide have been growing ever more rapidly. Some of this growth has occurred in the developed world, but the most dramatic increase has been in the Third World. Almost all the world's population growth over the next 30 years will take place in the cities of developing countries\nBy the year 2030, for the first time in history, 60 percent of the world's people will be living in cities.\nThis is actually good news in some ways. \"Cities are the fundamental building blocks of prosperity,\" says Marc Weiss, chairman of the Prague Institute for Global Urban Development, \" both for the nation and for families.\" Industrial and commercial activities in urban areas account for between 50 and 80 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in most countries of the world\" there's the crazy notion that the way to deal with a city's problems is to keep people out of them,\"Weiss continued. \"But the problems of the rural life are even more serious than those of the city.\" For better or worse, urban-watchers are clear on one point: The quality of life for most people in the future will be determined by the quality of cities. Those cities will be bigger than ever. And yet, population numbers by themselves don't determine a city's prospects; after all, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and Hamburg, Germany, have the same population. Nor is explosive growth necessarily the determining factor. \"City problems,\" one authority points out, \"mostly have to do with weak, ineffective, and usually unrepresentative city governments.\"\nQuestion: According to the passage, in the year of 2030   _  .\nOptions: A: there will be 21 cities having a population of more than 10 million.\nB: rural area will be extinct.\nC: most people will live in cities.\nD: the third world will keep abreast with the developed world.",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\nArticle: William Butler Yeats, a most famous Irish writer, was born in Dublin on June 13, 1865. His childhood lacked the harmony that was typical of a happy family. Later, Yeats shocked  his family by saying that he remembered \"little of childhood but its pain\". In fact, he inherited excellent taste in art from his family--both his father and his brother were painters. But he finally settled on literature, particularly drama and poetry.\nYeats had strong faith in the coming of new artistic movements. He set himself the fresh task in founding an Irish national theatre in the late 1890s. His early theatrical experiments, however, were not received favorably at beginning. He didn't lose heart, and finally enjoyed success in his poetical drama.\nCompared with his dramatic works, Yeats's poems attract much admiring notice. The subject matter includes love, nature, history, time and aging. Though Yeats generally relied on very traditional forms, he brought modern sensibility to them. As his literary life progressed, his poetry grew finer and richer, which led him to worldwide recognition.\nHe had not enjoyed a major public life since winning the Nobel Price in 1923. Yet, he continued writing almost to the end of his life. Had Yeats stopped writing at age 40, he would probably now be valued as a minor poet, for there is no other example in literary history of a poet who produces his greatest works between the ages of 50 and 75. After Yeats' death in 1939, W. H. Auden wrote, among others, the following lines:\nEarth, receive an honored guest:\nWilliam Yeats is laid to rest.\nLet the Irish vessel lie\nEmptied of its poetry.\nOptions:\nA Envy\nB Sympathy\nC Emptiness\nD Admiration\nAnswer:\nD Admiration\nQuestion:",

At first, my brothers and sister and I would travel hours to get home, but eventually we got to the point where just one or two of us would make it back to go to Mass with her and spend the day together.\nThe great love of her life, the man who broke up with her right before her college graduation, only to return two years later claiming he'd traveled the world and hadn't found anyone to compare with her, remained a daily presence in her life. She spoke about him so often and kept his memory so alive that people were sometimes surprised to learn that he was gone. She took over the garden where he'd planted and made it her own.\nWhen the 10th anniversary of his death approached, my mom began talking about it and planning for it weeks in advance. The date on her kitchen calendar was circled and marked R.I.P. (Rest in Peace). Of course she wanted all of us there and settled the dates for our coming back.\nOn Monday -- the day before the anniversary -- she went to morning Mass and walked downtown for lunch with friends, and later told my sister on the phone that she felt Dad still so close that as she was walking back home, she heard someone yell and thought, \"Oh, there's Dick.\"\nThat evening she went out to water flowers, just as my father, 10 years before, had gone out to the garden to pick vegetables before he died.

When Washington wrote that, Englishmen had been referring to insects as bugs for more than a century, and Americans had already created lighining-bug . But the English were soon to stop using the bugs in their language, leaving it to the Americans to call a bug a bug in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\nThe American bug could also be a person, referring to someone who was crazy about a particular activity. Althoug fan became the usual term. sports fans used to be called racing bugs, baseballbugs, and the like.\nOr the bug could be a small machine or object, for example, a bug-shaped car. The bug could also be a burglar alarm, from which comes the expression to bug, that is, \"to install   an alarm\". Now it means a small piece of equipment that people use for listening secretly to others' conversation. Since the 1840s, to bug has long meant \"to cheat\", and since the 1940s it has been annoying.\nWe also know the bug as a _ in a computer program or other design. That meaning dates back to the time of Thomas Edison. In 1878 he explained bugs as \"little problems and difficulties\" that required months of study and labor to overcome in developing a successful product. In 1889 it was recorded that Edison \"had been up the two previous nights discovering 'a bug' in his invented record player.\"\nQuestion: The passage is mainly concerned with  _  .\nAnswer:",

World Food program says there are growing concerns over food insecurity in the developing world. Some of those concerns are discussed in a report to agree with the anniversary Sunday of World Food Day.\nThe theme for World Food Day 2011 is \"Food prices-From Crisis to Stability\". A ceremony to mark World Food Day will be held Monday at the headquarters of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome.\nRising food prices, weather emergencies and political instability are deepening the struggle of families trying to provide for their households in many developing nations.\nThis year's \"State of Food In security in the World\" report, published last week, focuses on the impact of food price  _ confirming that high, unpredictable prices are likely to continue.\nThe report highlighted how poor consumers, small farmers and countries dependent on imports, especially in Africa, have been deeply affected by the food and economic crises.\nGregory Barrow is with the World Food Program in Rome.\n\"if you look at the places where World Food program works particularly in developing countries, you see populations of people who might be spending 60,70,80percent of their salaries on purchasing food for their families\".\nBarrow added that if prices become changeful and generally start rising, even by a small amount, it means that many of these people are going to struggle to put nutritious food on their tables.\nThe report also showed that even short-term fluctuations in prices can have a long-term effect on development, and that cutting back on nutritious food in the first 1.000 days of a child's life can affect mental and physical development and finally, future earning capacity .\nThe United Nations has programs in place aimed at reducing the number of hungry people by one-half by 2015.But most observers agree this target is unlikely to be reached.\nQuestion: The U.N.

Then I joined a slimming club. My target was 140 pounds and I lost 30 pounds in six months. I felt great and people kept saying how good I looked. But Christmas came and I started to slip back into my old eating habits. I told myself I'd lose the weight at slimming classes in the new year... but it didn't happen. Instead of losing the pounds, I put them on. I'd lost willpower and tried to believe that the old bag of fish and chips didn't make any difference -- but the _ don't lie.\nRoz Juma:\nTo be honest, I never weigh myself any more. I've learnt to be happy with myself. It seemed to me that I would feel sorry about every spoonful of tasty food that passed my lips. My idea is simple. You shouldn't be too much thinking about food and dieting. Instead, you should get on with life and stop dreaming of a super thin body. This is obviously the size I'm meant to be and, most of all, I'm happy with it.\nLesley Codwin:\nI was very happy at winning Young Slimmer of the year. I'd look in the mirror unable to believe this slim lady was me! That might have been my problem -- perhaps from then on I didn't pay any attention to myself. Winning a national competition makes everything worse, though. Because you feel the eyes of the world are fixed upon you. I feel a complete failure because I've put on weight again.\nRos Langfod:\nBefore moving in with my husband Gavin, I'd always been about 110 pounds, but the pleasant housework went straight to my waist and I put on 15 pounds in a year. Every so often I try to go on a diet... I'm really good in a few days, then end up having the children's leftovers or eating happily chocolate -- my weakness. I'd like to be slim, but right now my duty is the children and home. I might take more exercise when my kids are older.\nQuestion: What do you think the four women were talking about?\nOptions: A: Different diets they prefer.\nB: Their life after marriage.\nC: Tex books for students.\nD: Their own slimming matter.",

        "Article: Could a grizzly bear move to your neighborhood? If you live in the U.S. West, the answer may be yes. People and grizzly bears are living closer together now.\nThe grizzly bear is one of the largest meat-eating land animals in North America. In the early 1800s, about 50,000 grizzly bears lived there. Today there're far fewer bears. Settlers built cities and roads where bears lived. Many bears were hunted and killed. Now only 1,200 to 1,400 grizzly bears have remained.\nIn and around Yellowstone National Park, grizzly bears have been making a comeback because of people's efforts to protect them. Some bears are moving to areas where people live. People are also moving into grizzly countries.\nPeople there have to learn how to live with their new, furry   neighbors peacefully. If someone leaves their barbecue grill out overnight, or leaves their pet food or rubbish where a bear can get it, the bear will learn to come to their house for food. Grizzly bears that learn to eat people's food can become dangerous, and they often have to be killed or moved. Also, it's important not to surprise a grizzly. Besides, if you are hiking in a grizzly country, you should go with others and make a noise to make bears hear your coming and get out of the way. You may not want to invite grizzly bears to your next neighborhood party, but with a little effort, grizzly bears and people can live together peacefully.\nQuestion: Compared with the early 1800s, the number of grizzly bears has got smaller by   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"about 96%\"?",

Apart from \"family\", \"friends\" and \"favorite foods\", many people mentioned \"the Sunday newspapers\" and \"the crossword puzzle\".\nIt's certainly true that among their many hobbies, the English enjoy words, above all reading them and playing with them. Reading books is one of the most popular relaxation activities, with approximately 100,000 books a year published. Over 80 per cent of the population regularly read a daily newspaper, and there are more newspapers per person than any other country except Japan. The weekend newspapers generally contain hundreds of pages, and even the most popular hobbies -- fishing, stamp collecting, train-spotting, bird-watching, walking, sports, pets, flower-arranging, knitting and pigeon-fancying -- have at least  _ , if not several specialist magazines, devoted to them. In fact, many people probably spend more time reading about their hobbies than actually doing them.\nIt's also undoubtedly true that word games, puzzles and competitions are hugely popular in newspapers, on the radio and even on television. One of the most popular television games in the 1980s and 1990s was \"Call My Bluff\" where two teams of players had to guess which of three meanings of an unfamiliar word was correct. In many cases newspapers have a word games section, such as a \"Words within Words\" competition where the aim is to make as many words as possible with the letters of a single word. Above all, crossword puzzles are the most familiar word game, with clues ranging from words which have the same meaning as other words, to the \"Cryptic\" where the meaning of the word is expressed in a very indirect way, and in a variety of linguistic  and cultural references. Apparently, some people choose their newspaper not because of the quality of the news coverage but because of the crossword puzzle.\nYou...\nQuestion: What is the author's purpose of writing the article?\nOptions: A: To encourage readers to read newspapers.\nB: To tell readers the functions of the newspaper.\nC: To report the result of a survey by The Dependent.\nD: To entertain readers with what is written in the article.",

There have been hundreds of other books declaring to offer a quick look behind the Palace doors, but this is the first written by someone who is closely related to the royal family and has shared their lives----not only throughout the Queen's reign but also through that of her father, King George VI.\n         The Final Curtseywas written by Her Majesty's cousin and childhood playmate, the Honorable Margaret Rhodes. It tells in detail the story of Mrs. Rhodes's relationship with the royal family over eight decades. The book, showed with delightfully informal and never-before-seen pictures, has been written with the full knowledge of the Queen, who has read and approved parts of it.\n         Mrs. Rhodes lives on the royal farm in Windsor Great Park, in a house given to her by the Queen in 1980.

        "A rapidly advancing contemporary science that is highly dependent on new tools is Earth system science. Earth system science involves observation and measurements on the Earth at all scales from the largest to the smallest. The huge amounts of data that are gathered come from many different locations and require special techniques for handling data. Important new tools that facilitate Earth system science include satellite remote sensing, small deep-sea submarines, and geographic information systems.\nMore than any other way of gathering evidence, satellite observations continually remind us that each part of the Earth interacts with and is dependent on all other parts.\nEarth system science was born from the realization of that interdependence. Satellite remote sensing makes possible observations at large scales, and in many cases, measurements of factors that could not otherwise be measured. For example, the ozone hole over Antarctica--the decrease in the concentration of ozone high in the atmosphere--is measured by remote sensing, as are changes in deserts, forests, and farmlands around the world. Such measurements can be used in many areas of specialization besides Earth system science. Archaeology, for example, has benefited from satellite observations that reveal the traces of ancient trade routes across the Arabian Desert.\nNew tools for exploring previously inaccessible areas of the Earth have also added greatly to our knowledge of the Earth system. Small deep-sea submarines allow scientists to travel to the depths of the ocean. There they have discovered new species and ecosystems thriving near deep-sea vents that emit heat, sasses, and mineral-rich water.\nJust as important as new methods of measurement and exploration are new ways to store and analyze data about the Earth system. Computer-based software programs known as geographic information systems, or GIS, allow a large number of data points to be stored along with their locations. These can be used to produce maps and to compare different sets of...\nThe author of the passage mentions that satellite observations are especially effective in   _  .\nA) conducting scientific studies of life on the ocean floor\nB) predicting future climate changes\nC) providing data to determine Earth's age\nD) demonstrating interactions among all of Earth's parts",

And so it goes on until one of the men crashes through a window and falls thirty feet to the ground below. He is dead!\nOf course he isn't really dead. With any luck he isn't even hurt. Why ? Because the men who fall out of high windows or jump from fast moving trains, who crash cars of even catching fire, are professionals .They do this for a living. These men are called stuntmen. That is to say, they perform tricks .\nThere are two sides to their work. They actually do most of the things you see on the screen. For example, they fall from a high building. However, they do not fall on to hard ground but on to empty cardboard boxes covered with a mattress . Again, when they hit one another with chairs, the chairs are made of soft wood and when they crash through windows, the glass is made of sugar!\nBut although their work depend on trick of this sort, it also requires a high degree of skill and training. Often a stuntman's success depends on careful timing .For example, when he is \"blown up\" in a battle scene, he has to jump out of the way of the explosion just at the right moment.\nNaturally stuntmen are well paid for their work, but they lead dangerous lives. They often get seriously injured, and sometimes killed. A Norwegian stuntman, for example, skied over the edge of a cliff a thousand feet high. His parachute failed to open, and he was killed.\nIn spite of all the risks, this is no longer a profession for men only.

The New York Times received suggestions recently from PhD students and seniors at some of the top universities . Here is their advice.\n\"Many young people today are raised in a protective cocoon \", wrote Tim Novikoff, a PhD student at Comell. \"College is a time to explore the world beyond and a chance to learn new things about yourself. Take classes in different subjects. Try lots of different clubs and activities.\"\nRemember also to take some time away from campus, suggested Willie Lin, a student at Washington University. \" _ \"\nTry to find work assisting a researcher or a professor---this is the advice from Aman Singh Gill, a PhD student at Stony Brook University. And he also said, \"With a window into the world of research, you will find yourself thinking more critically, accepting fewer states at face value and perhaps developing a brave sense of what you can accomplish.\"\nMany young people can't imagine even a single day without devices such as computers and cell phones. But try to keep yourself off them, cautioned Christine Smallwood, a PhD student at Columbia University.\nStart by scheduling a few Internet-free hours each day, with your phone turned off. It's the only way you'll be able to read anything serious. \"This will also have the benefit of making you harder to reach, and thus more mysterious and fascinating to new friends and acquaintances ,\" she suggested.\nQuestion: This passage is mainly about   _  .\nOptions: A: tips from some students for college life\nB: ways to read something serious regularly\nC: days without cell-phones and computers\nD: chances to go to university you really like",

Town or city twinning means two towns in different countries agree and decide to become \"twins\" with a sister-city relationship.\nThe people find pen friends in the twin town. They exchange newspapers and stamps. The school teachers discuss teaching methods with the teachers in the twin town. Officials visit the twin town for celebrations. Ordinary people travel to the twin town, too, but not very often if it is far away.\nSometimes, schools even exchange their classes for two or three weeks! For example, German middle school students study for a while at the school in their twin town in Britain, staying with British families. A few months later, their British friends come to study in Germany.\nMany British towns are so pleased with the results of the twinning that they set out to find more than one twin town!\nTonbridge, a small town in Kent, for example, has twin towns in both Germany and France. Richmond near London has relationships with Germany, France and even a town in a Balkan  country!\nTown twinning can help make friends. It helps students improve their language skill, and also helps people to understand the differences between nations.\nQuestion: Which is the best title for the passage?\nOptions: A: Town Twinning\nB: Friendly Towns\nC: Exchanging Teachers and Students\nD: Peace and Understanding",

It crossed New York from Buffalo on Lake Erie Troy to Albany on the Hudson River. It joined the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean. The canal served as a route over which industrial goods could flow into the west, and materials could pour into the east. The Erie Canal helped New York develop into the nation's largest city.\nThe building of the canal was paid for entirely by the state of New York. It cost $ 7 143 789, but it soon gained its price many times over. Between 1825, when the canal was opened, and 1882, when toll charges  were stopped, the state collected $121 461 891.\nFor a hundred years before the Erie was built, people had been talking about a canal which could join the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. The man who planned the Erie Canal and carried the plan through was De Witt Clinton. Those who were against the canal laughingly called it \"Clinton's Ditch \". Clinton talked and wrote about the canal and drew up plans for it. He and Governor Morris went to Washington in 1812 to ask for help for the canal, but they were unsuccessful.\nClinton became governor of New York in 1817, and shortly afterwards, on July 4, 1817, broke ground for the canal in Rome, N.Y. The first part of the canal was completed in 1820. As the canal grew, towns along its course developed fast. The length of the canal is 363 miles.\nQuestion: It can be inferred that   _   into the Atlantic Ocean.\nOptions: A: the Great Lakes flow\nB: the Hudson River flows\nC: Lake Erie flows\nD: the Erie Canal flows",

The trip was for 2 weeks during the March break from school. This trip was probably about 20 years ago so it was before the time of things like portable video games and being able to watch movies in the back seat.2\nSo to pass the many hours of travel my brother and I had to entertain ourselves and each other. My mum would set the back seat up so that it was our own little playroom. She would pack everything up so that we had a big level area to play in. We would play cards and board games.C\nWhen it got to the point where we were at each other's throats we would be sent back to our own side of the seat and would be forced to either nap or read by ourselves until we could be friendly to each other again. I can remember us playing for quite some time when we turned the back seat into a spaceship and traveled around the earth.f\nAnother time we turned it into a kitchen and had a bake-off . But the thing that I remember the most and that gave us many hours of enjoyment was using each other's faces as silly Plasticine  and making funny faces. We would see how far we could stretch each other's mouths open, see how thin we could make the other's eye by pulling on it. We would keep going until one of us begged for mercy because we had to give our faces a rest.7\nSo while I can remember us having a great time on the beach, laughing a lot trying to put the tent up in the rain, what I remember the most of that trip and what always makes me smile the most is remembering the pain that our faces would be in after the trip.g\nQuestion: What does the author mean by saying \"we were at each other's throats\"?A\nAnswer:",

The Galapagos are among the world's most important scientific treasures, a group of volcanic islands surrounded by deserted beaches and inhabited by unique varieties of giant tortoise, lizards, and birds.\nYet life on this United Nations world heritage site has turned sour. Battles have broken out between fishermen and conservationists. Ecuador, which owns the islands, has sent a naval patrol   to put down disturbances.\nThe controversial director of the Galapagos National Park--which controls 97 percent of Galapagos land and the reserve extending to 40 miles offshore--has been fired, while an air of uneasy tension hangs over the islands, as the islanders prepare for election when they pick their representatives in Ecuador's national assembly.\n\"It's a very tense situation,\" said Leonor Stjepic, director of the London-based Galapagos Conservation Trust, which raises money to help projects on the islands. \"We are watching it with concern.\"\nThe violence has been triggered by an alarming growth in the islands' population.

And their complaints are often valid, but such an experience at Beijing's restaurants will apparently soon be history.\nForeign visitors will no longer, hopefully, be confused by oddly worded restaurant menus in the capital if the government's plan to correctly translate 3,000 Chinese dishes is a success and the translations are generally adopted.\nThe municipal office of foreign affairs has published a book to recommend English translations of Chinese dishes, which aims to help restaurants avoid bizarre translations. It provides the names of main dishes of famous Chinese cuisines in plain English, \"an official with the city's Foreign Affairs office said .\" Restaurants are encouraged to use the proposed translations, but it will not be compulsory .\" It's the city's latest effort to bridge the culture gap for foreign travelers in China.\nComing up with precise translations is a\ntask, as some Chinese culinary techniques are untranslatable and many Chinese dishes have no English-language equivalent.The translators, after conducting a study of Chinese restaurants in English-speaking countries, divided the dish names into four categories: ingredients, cooking method, taste and name of a person or a place.

If she were hired because of her excellent performance, she still wouldn't have the qualifications on paper.

Tough problem!\nWhile Mei's future hangs in the balance, the public having learned of the case got involved. Some people said the Bureau should employ her, since results are the only important thing. \"After all, ability is more important than a diploma, \"said one office worker.\nOthers, however, have attacked Mei's dishonesty.

Mei wasn't honest, so she shouldn't be hired.\nBut, Shen Ronghua, the head of the Shanghai Public Administration and Human Resources Institute, tries to be a bit more philosophical.\n\"There is still a sort of  'diploma means this'  prejudice among people,\" Shen explains, \"Many employers regard a diploma as the only sign of ability and talent.\"\nSo, with this in mind, people may pay little attention to whether someone has real ability or not. They turn to chasing a diploma instead. The unreal diploma is the natural product of this thought.\nThe conclusion? \"China needs a new human resource system.

However, there are a few tips you can use in order to earn a top grade ---- as well as actually use the skills you've learned.\nOne of the most important and basic lessons in dealing with a foreign language is to learn and understand each concept and lesson before moving on to the next one. If you don't understand one concept but move on to the next chapter anyway, you're less likely to understand the new material.\nLearning a new language is not only an academic tool, but can help you in your everyday life as well. Being good at another language can help you communicate with other people, and help you when traveling to foreign countries, and even make your resume look better.\nAnd it is important to learn correct pronunciation as soon as possible for poor pronunciation can be hard to break. Native speakers of the language as well as others fluent in the language you are learning will appreciate your efforts to learn correct pronunciation.\nGather outside materials such as books, study guides, books on tape, and travel books to aid you in learning the language. Your textbooks can't possibly teach you everything you need to know, so seeking outside sources is generally a good rule of thumb to keep in mind.\nA significant motivator in learning a foreign language is traveling to the country where the language is spoken. That way, you can see firsthand how the language is used, learn the culture, and meet native speakers of the language. Native speakers appreciate sincere attempts of others who take the time to learn their language.\nSeek out native speakers of your new language in your school or neighborhood. They can help you with many skills, including pronunciation, and they can provide immediate feedback on your progress.\nQuestion: In which part of a website would this text probably appear?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Education.\"?",

Jen had heard about the strange things in Oxbridge interviews, and believed that this was a test. \"What if they're watching me?\" she thought. \"If I move the fork, it will show initiative  ; if I don't move it, it will show that I can easily fit into new situations.\" In the end, she sat uncomfortably on the edge of the chair!\nApplicants must be prepared for the unexpected.

But she soon calmed down, started thinking, and found that there was plenty to talk about.\nOxbridge interviews are designed to find out how you think, not just what you think.

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery, partly because it cannot be detected  by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around but we can't detect them or sense them without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things.\nAt very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being outright by killing masses of cells in important organs. Even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no level of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and when they are killed outright. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They reproduce themselves in an unusual way. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years.\nThis is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the knowledge of the person at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die of cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. A child can be born weak or easy to get serious illness as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents.\nQuestion: Which of the following can be best inferred from the passage?\nOptions: A: The importance of protection from radiation cannot be overemphasized .\nB: The mystery about radiation has been solved.\nC: Cancer is only caused by radiation.\nD: Radiation can hurt those who do know about its danger.",

The local rulers have explored all the conventional ways to get traffic moving again,including higher prices for parking,fuel and insurance. But at a recent conference in Hamburg, Hussain Lootah said that the city may adopt a more strict approach: setting an income level for vehicle ownership.\nMr Lootah's approach is unlikely to be copied widely, but mayors of other big cities around the world are starting to think about taking severe actions of their own, including complete car bans in inner cities.But the efforts may not be enough to reduce traffic and pollution. The problems will only get worse: the number of vehicles sold globally each year will grow from around 80 million today to more than 100 million by the end of the decade, according to IHS Automotive.\nThere are already a handful of car-free communities around the world.But these are typically small and often tourist destinations that seek to create a throwback(;) in time, such as Sark Island, in the English Channel. The largest car-free urban area is probably Venice, where it is impossible to build roads and bridges to link the more than 100 small islands the city sits on.\nYet pedestrian malls  and other car-free zones keep popping up in cities around the world. Some cities are considering ways to limit central city access to \"green\" machines, such as battery-electric vehicles. Hamburg is perhaps the furthest along.\nSuch extreme plans may fly in a city such as Hamburg. But in many other cities the political resistance even to less far-reaching measures is hard to overcome. Michael Bloomberg, New York's former mayor, tried twice to introduce a jam charge for much of Manhattan, but his plans were rejected by state lawmakers.\nQuestion: It is still hard to reduce traffic problems, because   _  .\n- Mr Lootah's approach will be copied widely.\n- mayors take gentle measures toward them.\n- more vehicles will be sold globally each year.\n- complete car bans in inner cities are not made.",

Under his scope, which magnifies the sample 1,000 times, the smog is found to contain minerals, fragments of animal fur and insects, seeds and burnt dust.But many are compounds, he says, which are more difficult to identify.\nZhang realizes that he may have disappointed the public because he can't show the inner construction of PM2.5 , today's most notorious(.) element in smog.

Often,explaining a thought is the process of understanding.In other words, you increase your brain power by exercising your\"explain power\".\nAnother benefit of writing is that it helps you remember.

But what if you wanted a special suit to keep a shark from hurting you?

Before Sullivan could sell his sharksuits, he needed to make sure his design would work. Sullivan put on the sharksuit and jumped into a shark feeding ground. \"I need to know exactly what a human body could expect to go through,\" he says. Sharks moved all around him and then attacked his arm. Sullivan felt the bite but no teeth. He was uncomfortable at times, but not painful.

But have you ever thought about how to take care of four to twelve old people when you grow up and get married? This could be a problem for most Chinese youths as China is entering a new stage of an aging society.\nAn aging society refers to one where 10 percent or more of its population is over 60. By the end of 2007, Chinese over 60 years old have made up 11.7 percent of the nation's total population. \"China is getting old before becoming rich,\"said Cai Chuang, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The population increase that has powered Chinese growth for three decades will give way over the next ten years to a rapid aging of the society. This will lead to weaker economic growth, because of a lack of labor resources.\nAs a result of the family planning policy, it is expected that the country's total working population will decrease after 2015.\nChina is not the only country getting old. More that 60 countries have become aging societies and one in three people in the European Union is a senior citizen.\nHowever, experts said that China doesn't have a highly developed social security network to support the old. Social security is an insurance program protecting those in need, including the old, the disabled and others.\nQuestion: If China enters an aging society,   _  .\nOptions: A: there will not be enough labor resources\nB: the family planning policy will be ended\nC: everyone needs to take care of four to twelve old people\nD: China will have a highly developed social security network",

They despair when they watch their beloved spend much money on extra baggage charge. Nearly half of these women admitted to lying about the weight of their case to their partner before leaving for the airport, in fear of being made to unload some unnecessary items.\nBut it's a fact that women pack more than they need. On average, a woman needs around 57 items in suitcase for a two-week holiday, yet most women pack nearer to 150 items, ranging from skirts, tops, underwear and high heels. In addition, women pack more sun cream, make-up and hair appliances than they were likely to need. They all take up space in the suitcase, only a third of them will see the light of day once at the holiday place.\n79 percent of women admitted to taking extra items with them, with the reason for this being \"just in case\". Women plan their holiday wardrobe  months in advance. Packing enough clothes and other items to last a month is not enough for some women. They'd take a chance to shop for new items while holidaying abroad. So they'll return with even more luggage in their cases.\nProfessor Karen Pine said: \"Women are tempted to take familiar items with them on holiday, often everything except the kitchen sink. Some people find traveling stressful, particularly when they're unsure about the home comforts available at their holiday place. They over-pack to help cope with those feelings of stress and reduce the uncertainty.\"\nThis will come as no surprise to some men, who are used to trying to squeeze their partner's luggage into the boot of the car with their own, smaller case.

        "Believe it or not but it is true. There are people who lose the ability to understand or use words due to brain damage. But they become extremely good at something else. They become experts at spotting liars. The condition in which people lose their power to understand or use words due to brain damage are called aphasia . A study conducted in Massachusetts, U.S., has clearly proved that aphasics make good lie detectors .\nIn the last 100 years, many doctors studying the brain have mentioned examples of this amazing power of patients suffering from aphasia. Recently, scientists conducted tests to see if all that was said about aphasics was true. They studied the powers of a mixed group of people. Some were normal; others were aphasic. And it was proved clearly that the normal volunteers still got fooled by words. The aphasics were far ahead of them in recognizing false speech. The results of the study were reported in the magazine Nature.\n`Fourteen years ago, famous American doctor, Dr. Oliver Sacks, wrote about his experiences with aphasic patients in a book. He remembered a particular incident in a hospital. Patients from the aphasia room were watching TV. Their president, Ronald Reagan, was giving a speech. He was trying to put feelings into each and every word of his speech. But his speech had an opposite effect on the patients. They were not impressed. On the contrary, the whole room shook with their laughter. The aphasics knew that he did not mean a word of what he was saying.\nDr. Sacks saw aphasics as more gifted than normal people. Normal people \"get carried away\" by words. An aphasic cannot understand words. But he or she can still understand what is being said. He said most of the aphasics had this superior understanding. So, while normal people think of aphasic patients as brain damaged, they actually seem to understand human expressions better.\nWhich would be the best title of the passage?\nA) A great discovery\nB) The great lie detectors\nC) Why aphasics can't talk\nD) A special way of understanding",

The loss of opportunities for outdoor play is one of the main causes of childhood obesity. What is more remarkable is the growing evidence that children's mental health and emotional well-being are enhanced by contact with the outdoors, and that the restorative  effect appears to be strongest in natural settings. Researchers are convinced of the depth of the connection between children's well-being and the environment, claiming that contact with nature may be as important to children as good nutrition and adequate sleep.\nBut now children seem to get less touch with outdoor activities. The root causes of the dramatic loss of children's freedom lie in changes to the very fabric of their lives over the last 30 years or so. The growth in road traffic, alongside poor town planning and shifts in the make-up and daily rhythms of families and communities, have left children with fewer outdoor places to go. These changes coincided with the \"culture of fear\": a generalized anxiety about all imaginary kinds of threats, even though children are statistically safer from harm now than at any point in human history.\nThese physical, economic and social changes and fears have been made use of by manufactures and advertisers, whose products and messages both reinforce the logic of keeping children virtual prisoners, and force us to compensate them in the only way our cash-rich, time-poor society seems to know: by spending money on them.\nGovernment must bear some of the blame for keeping children prisoners indoor, through their promotion of planning policies that favour cars over communities and profit over people. The real planning crimes lie in housing companies occupying attractive parks and green spaces, and in town plans that force families to depend largely on their cars. There is no doubt that traffic danger, unlike stranger danger, is a real threat to children and a constant worry for parents. \nAround 100 child pedestrians  are killed...\nQuestion: Children have less outdoor freedom nowadays because   _  .\n- it is easier to travel by car.\n- of fewer outdoor play areas\n- of published safety statistics\n- more houses will be built",

At the end of the week we would check her bank balance.\nEach day my daughter handed over one penny at the breakfast table and I deposited it in her bank. I gave her a \"receipt\" for her deposit and explained that she needed to keep up with the receipts to see how much money she had added to her account. In an effort to make this a little more realistic, I deposited a penny from my own piggy bank every other day to give her an additional four pennies at the end of the week.\nOn Sunday evening we gathered receipts and confirmed she had deposited seven pennies in \"The Bank of Dad. \" Then I opened the old film container and counted out its contents--all eleven pennies. \"Hey, there are four extra pennies in there!\" I explained that her original seven pennies had grown to eleven pennies because every couple days the bank paid her a penny for letting them use her money--that's interest. She paused and asked, \"Dad, what would happen if you deposited like a hundred million pennies in the bank?\nQuestion: What can we infer from the passage?\nYes or no, is the answer \"The father used a good way to show his daughter about interest.\"?",

        "Article: Almost one - fourth of all personal spending in theprefix = st1 /United Statestakes place during the holiday season. There are gifts to give this month for Christmas, Hanukkah and the African American celebration of Kwanzaa. The traditional shopping season began last Friday, after Thanksgiving Day. Personal spending represents two-thirds of the economy, so holiday sales are especially important.\nReports on November results have just come out. Wal-Mart is the biggest seller in the world. The company had expected growth of two to four percent in November, fueled by sales on \"Black Friday.\" \nThe day after Thanksgiving is called that. Storekeepers used to record profits   in black ink and losses in red ink. A day in the black means a return to profit. \nThe National Retail Federation estimated   in September that holiday sales would increase four and one-half percent this year. Holiday sales increased five percent last year, after poor sales the year before. \nThe business group estimated that Americans will spend 220,000 million dollars this season. It says they spent just over 10 percent of that last weekend. \nAlso, it says more Americans for the first time this season plan to use a debit card than a credit card for purchases. A debit card, also called a check card, is linked to the money that a person has in a bank. In other words, users must have the money before they can spend it. \nAbout thirty - five percent of shoppers said they would mainly use debit cards, compared to 30 percent for credit cards. Financial experts say this change might mean that more people want to keep to a budget this holiday season.\nQuestion: More people plan to use the debit card in that_.\nYes or no, is the answer \"they want to limit their expenditure\"?",

        "I grew up in a house where the TV was seldom turned on and with one wall in my bedroom entirely lined with bookshelves, most of my childhood was spent on books I could get hold of. In fact, I grew up thinking of reading as natural as breathing and books unbelievably powerful in shaping perspectives by creating worlds we could step into, take part in and live in.\nWith this unshakable belief, I, at fourteen, decided to become a writer. Here too, reading became useful. Every writer starts off knowing that he has something to say, but being unable to find the right ways to say it. He has to find his own _ by reading widely and discovering which parts of the writers he agrees or disagrees with, or agrees with so strongly that it reshapes his own world. He cannot write without loving to read, because only through reading other people's writing can one discover what works, what doesn't and, in the end, together with lots of practice, what voice he has.\nNow I am in college, and have come to realize how important it is to read fiction. As a law student, my reading is in fact limited to subject matter -- the volume of what I have to read for classes every week means there is little time to read anything else. Such reading made it all the clearer to me that I live in a very small part in this great place called life. Reading fiction reminds me that there is life beyond my own. It allows me to travel across the high seas and along the Silk Road, all from the comfort of my own armchair, to experience, though secondhand, exciting experiences that I wouldn't necessarily be able to have in my lifetime.\nWhat effect does reading have on the author?\nA) It opens up a wider world for him.\nB) It helps him to realize his dream.\nC) It makes his college life more interesting.\nD) It increases his interest in worldwide travel.",

Many people believe that they deserve success simply because they believe that they deserve success.\nBut there is a widespread belief that people who get on in life may be successful not because they deserve it, but because of influential    friends or the right background. Sometimes it may just be a comforting and harmless belief, while at the other extreme it can be very destructive. I once met a brilliant young engineer who worked in a chemical plant. Because of her knowledge and experience, she should have been promoted to Production Manager. Instead, the job went to a man who was totally unsuited for the post. Everyone knew that he only got it because he was politically acceptable to his superiors  . This injustice discouraged the young engineer and many of her colleagues. It also meant that the factory was much less efficient than it could have been.\nAt the same time, we should not be pessimistic  . More and more the modern world depends on having people who are in the job because they are good enough, not just because their faces fit. There is a story of a factory owner who sent for an engineer to see to a machine which would not go. He examined it, then took out a hammer and tapped, once. The machine started up immediately. When he presented his bill, the owner protested, \"This can't be right! $ 100 just for tapping a machine with a hammer?\" The engineer wrote out a new bill: \"For tapping a machine, $1; for knowing where to tap. $99.\"\nOptions:\nA Having influential friends or right background seems helpful sometimes.\nB The engineer had good reason to overcharge the factory owner.\nC Not all those who are good in their jobs have the chance to be promoted.\nD Those who are good in their jobs are still largely needed by the modern society.\nAnswer:\nB The engineer had good reason to overcharge the factory owner.\nQuestion:",

Little Nicky was cloned by an American company, called GSC. But the new cat cost his owner $50,000.\n\"He is the same. His characteristics are the same,\" the woman told news reporters.

On the one hand, you have a conventionally grown apple. On the other, you have one that's organic. Both apples are firm, shiny and red. Both provide vitamins and fiber, and both are free of fat, sodium and cholesterol.\nConventionally grown food generally costs less, but is organic food a better choice?

Supporters of organic foods -- a term whose meaning varies greatly --are frequently telling the world that such products are safer and more nutritious than others.\nThe growing interest of consumers in the safety and nutritional quality of daily foods is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been aroused by sweeping claims that the conventional food supply is unsafe or inadequate in meeting nutritional needs.\nAlmost daily, the public is surrounded by claims for \"no-aging\" diets, new vitamins and other wonder foods. There are numerous unsubstantiated  reports that natural vitamins are superior to man-made ones, that fertilized eggs are nutritionally superior to unfertilized eggs, that untreated grains are better than those treated with insect spray and the like.\nAlthough most of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, large amounts of written material about the benefits of organic foods makes it difficult for people to separate fact from fiction. As a result, claims that eating a diet consisting of organically grown foods prevents or cures disease or provides other benefits to health have become widely advertised and form the basis for people's opinion.\nOne thing that most organically grown food products seem to have in common is that they cost more than conventionally grown foods.

        "Read the following article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Have you ever walked outside thinking it was one temperature but quickly discovered it felt colder? That is because of the \"wind chill\" effect.\nWind chill is how cold people and animals feel when they are outside, not the actual temperature on the thermometer . It is based on how quickly your body loses heat when it is exposed to wind and cold. When the wind is strong, your body quickly loses heat, making the temperature of your skin drop.\nWhen scientists first started calculating wind chill, they used research conducted in 1945 by explorers to Antarctica who measured how quickly water froze outside.\nBut water freezes faster than exposed skin, so the wind chill index based on that data wasn't accurate.\nIn 2001, the US government began to measure wind chill more precisely by testing how quickly people's skin froze.\nTwelve volunteers were placed in a chilled wind tunnel. Equipment was stuck to their faces to measure the heat flow from their cheeks, forehead, nose and chin while they walked three miles per hour on a treadmill .\nThe experiment revealed how quickly exposed skin can be damaged, particularly unprotected areas like your fingers, toes, the tip of your nose and your ear lobes. In fact, 40 percent of your body heat can be lost through your head! Signs you might have frostbite  are when the skin turns white or pale and you lose feeling in that area.\nThe information collected from the volunteers helped scientists work out the math to compute wind chill. It involves wind speed and air temperature.\nIf, for example, the temperature outside is zero degrees Fahrenheit and the wind is blowing at 15 miles per hour, the wind chill is calculated at 19 degrees below zero.

I couldn't describe how I felt. But something special among the debris   turned my day around.\nI joined a club to clean up the beach after the storm last November. As I removed the debris from the beach, I noticed an object with shiny buttons in the wet sand. It was a jacket,and I was excited since Halloween  was coming and I thought I had found a great costume . After picking it up, I was able to see that the jacket was from West Point  , the United States Military Academy, and it had the name \"deGavre\" written inside. I realized the jacket might be important to someone. I decided to find the jacket's owner and return it.\nI called the West Point Museum, considering that if the family couldn't be found, the jacket should go there. The museum connected me with Kim McDermott, Director of Communications for the Academy's Association of Graduates. Kim soon ensured that the jacket had belonged to Chester Braddock deGavre, who was a 1933 graduate and a war hero, but passed away in 1993.\nI sent Kim a photo of the jacket and she posted it to the West Point Association of Graduates Facebook Page, asking if anyone could help us find the family. In less than two hours, someone had found and called the hero's wife, Teresa. Soon I started to receive personal messages from members of the deGavre family, their friends and others who were touched by the story and they found me on Facebook.\nFinding Chester deGavre's jacket and connecting to his family with the help of Facebook have been so meaningful to me. I've formed a bond  with amazing people I might have never met.\nSeeing the sight  after the storm, the author felt very   _  .\nA) sad\nB) surprised\nC) nervous\nD) disappointed",

Do you want to work indoors or outdoors, directly serve people in need or serve people  behind the scenes? These are the typical questions that volunteer service agencies would ask.\nEvery year, thousands of people in the west offer volunteer service. Volunteering greatly strengthens the community because it helps the old, the young, the weak, the sick, the disabled and the injured to overcome difficulties.\nVolunteers usually help in many different ways. They may give people advice, offer friendship to the young , drive the elderly to church, counsel kids against drugs, work as assistants in schools or nursing homes, raise funds, plant trees, help out in local libraries and do many other things. Volunteering can be a few hours a week or a few hours a month. Anybody who wants to serve people in need can become a volunteer.\nThe art of volunteering is a process of both giving and receiving. Volunteering allows volunteers to meet new people, make new friends and mix with people from all walks of life. Volunteering is an excellent way to experiment,practice and try out new techniques and skills,discover your individual talents and explore career choice. Being a volunteer will take individuals on a wonderful journey and help them learn many important things beyond their school learning.\nQuestion: Which of the following can best replace the underline words in the text?\nAnswer:",

The crowds, the noise and flying itself can cause unease. But there are classes that people can take to help them defeat the fear of flying. And now we are going to talk about similar training for service dogs that suffer from the same problem.\nService dogs almost never leave the side of the people they care for. You will see them working on buses, trains and other public transport systems. But the busy environment in an airport can trouble even the best trained working dog.\nPeople with disabilities depend on their dogs. They also need the dogs to remain calmly on duty on the airplane, even when the flight is not smooth. This takes special training. The Air Hollywood K9 Flight School is one place where such help can be found.\nThe school has a piece of equipment that provides the sights, sounds and even the feel of an airplane in flight. It is called a flight simulator . The simulator was built for filming airplane scenes in movies.\nSandy Alexander lives in Newport Beach, California. He has a disability that requires his two-year-old dog, Doc, to be always at his side. Mr. Alexander took the dog to the flight school to get him ready for plane trips. He says Doc did not like the bumpy  part of the flight simulation. \"When that started he was pretty _ and looked up at me and wasn't sure what was gong on.\"\n\"Dogs need to be exposed gradually and repetitively to stimulation, to the environment, to loud noises, to sounds and other dogs so that when this experience happens to them on a daily basis, they are able to act in a way that they are used to acting and don't get excitable,\" days dog trainer, Mary Segall.\nDog owners who have attended the training say they now feel much more at ease about future flights.

        "Read the following article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Wild elephants live in herds of 10 to about 50. The leader is usually a female. A herd can go through a forest quietly. It travels in a single line. It goes about 6 miles an hour. When frightened, it may run at about 25 miles an hour. When they reach water, elephants swim across. They are great swimmers.\n    Elephants eat grass, leaves, small branches, and bark. They particularly like the tender leaves on the top of trees. How do they get these leaves? They use their heads to knock trees down. They can easily knock down a 30-foot tree. Elephants also eat berries, mangoes, coconuts, corn, and sugar cane. They love salt. A wild male adult eats 500 to 600 pounds of food a day.\n    Many people want to find the graveyards   of elephants. There is a strong belief that such graveyards exist. Here is why. Bones and tusks of dead elephants have almost never been found. Searches have been made in forests. Grassy plains have been searched too. But neither bones nor tusks are found. Elephants don't live forever. Where are their bones? They don't just bury themselves. Here is one belief. When an elephant gets sick or old, it instinctively knows death is near. It leaves the herd. It goes off to a secret graveyard. The place is known only to elephants, and perhaps other animals, but not to humans. Obviously, such a graveyard would be filled with tusks. These were once very valuable. The objective of explorers was to find this \"gold\" mine. This graveyard belief may be a truth or a myth. But it is romantic. It would be nice if it were true.\nQuestion: From the passage we can learn that   _  .\n- other animals know where elephants' graveyards are\n- elephants bury themselves when their deaths are near\n- people have found bones and tusks of dead elephants\n- whether there are graveyards of elephants is still not known",

        "Read the article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Being sociable looks like a good way to add years to your life. Relationships with family, friends, neighbours, even pets, will all do the trick, but the biggest longevity boost seems to come from marriage or an equivalent relationship. The effect was first noted in 1858 by William Farr, who wrote that widows and widowers were at a much higher risk of dying than their married peers. Studies since then suggest that marriage could add as much as seven years to a man's life and two to a woman's. The effect holds for all causes of death, whether illness, accident or self-harm.\nEven if the odds are stacked against you(the conditions are not favourable),marriage can more than compensate. Linda Waite of the University of Chicago has found that a married older man with heart disease can expect to live nearly four years longer than an unmarried man with a healthy heart. Likewise, a married man who smokes more than a pack a day is likely to live as long as a divorced man who doesn't smoke. There's a _ , however, as partners are more likely to become ill or die in the couple of years following their spouses; death, and caring for a spouse with mental disorder can leave you with some of the  same severe problems. Even so, the odds favour marriage. In a 30-year study of more than 10,000 people, Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School describes how all kinds of social networks have similar effects.\nSo how does it work? The effects are complex, affected by socio-economic factors, health-service provision, emotional support and other more physiological mechanisms .For example, social contact can boost development of the brain and immune system, leading to better health and less chance of depression later in life. People in supportive relationships may handle stress better. Then there are the psychological benefits of a supportive partner.\nA life partner, children and good friends are all recommended if you aim to live to 100.The best social network is still being mapped out, but Christakis says:\" People are...\nQuestion: William Farr's study and other studies show that  _  .\nOptions: A: social life provides an effective cure for illness\nB: Being sociable helps improve one's quality of life\nC: Women benefit more than men from marriage\nD: Marriage contributes a great deal to longevity",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: In a growing number of English classes, teachers are leaving the classic novels on the shelf and letting students select the books they read. Supporters say that the new approach, called reader's workshop, helps develop a love for reading in students who are bored by classic literature. They argue that the best way to motivate students to read more is to offer them more choices.\n _ , however. They worry that students who choose trendy, less challenging titles over the classics won't be exposed to the great writing and key themes of important works of literature.Student reporters Donald and Sarah express their ideas about this new approach.\nDonald thinks that we should turn the page. Students should be allowed to select the books they read in English class. He says he and his classmates are allowed to pick their own books in class. That makes them more focused, and they look forward to class time. Tristin, a classmate of his at Clinton Middle School agrees. \"I'm reading books that I want to read, which makes class more fun and interesting,\" he says. Offering students a choice may also improve test scores. Studies by Professor John Guthrie of the University of Maryland found that students in grades 4 through 6 who had some choices in the books they read showed improved reading comprehension skills during testing. Giving students the chance to decide what they read helps build a lifelong love for reading. Isn't that what we want for our students?\nSarah holds a different view. She thinks teachers know more about books than students do. When an English teacher assigns a book, he or she keeps in mind the reading level of most students in the class. Students who choose their own books might be cheating themselves by picking books that are not up to their reading level or that are too difficult. Furthermore, a whole class can discuss a book it reads together. That makes it easier for some kids to understand what they are reading. \"The students wouldn't be able to hold a meaningful conversation if they were all...\nQuestion: The author develops the text mainly by   _  .\nOptions: A: listing cases\nB: making comparisons\nC: following time order\nD: explaining causes and effects",

To make it a realistic as well as exciting story, I decided that I first had to make a jump myself. Unfortunately, I am not good at any sport of any kind, let alone parachute jumping.\n  My friend Mr. Smith was willing to give me a hand. He took me to a ground school. The first day's training included several hours of instruction but not my first drop from an airplane. For this, I had to wait until the following morning.\n  The next morning, after a hurried, anxious breakfast, I was taken to the airfield. There, two heavy parachutes were put on my back. Then I was asked to make my way to a small plane which had just stopped slowly on the runway.\n  Once on the plane, it was soon climbing. I began to feel nervous. As we reached one thousand meters, Harry, my teacher, hooked  a line from my parachute to a steel ring inside the plane.

Here, the train carriages are usually the emptiest as well.\nCarry a bottle of water in warmer moths\nThe London Underground is over 150 years old and although the trains have been modernized, many still lack air conditioning and cooling units. Make sure you take a bottle of water with you, especially in the summer, as the long tube journeys can get very hot.\nKeep your personal belongings safe\nLike any large city be cautions of pickpockets operating in the busy stations and tubes.

Some people thought babies were not able to learn things until they were five or six months old.\nYet doctors in the United States say babies begin learning on their first day of life. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is a federal government agency. Its goal is to determine which experiences can influence healthy development in people.\nResearchers at the institute note that babies are strongly influenced by their environment. They say a baby will smile if her mother does something the baby likes. A baby learns to get the best care possible by smiling to please her mother or other caregiver. This is how babies learn to connect and communicate with other people.\nThe researchers say this ability to learn exists in a baby even before birth. They say newborn babies can recognize and understand sounds they heard while they were still developing inside their mothers.\nAnother study has suggested that low birth weight babies with no evidence of disability may be more likely than other children to have physical and mental problems.\nAmerican researchers studied almost five hundred boys and girls. They were born in, or admitted to, one of three hospitals in New Jersey between 1984 and 1987. At birth, each child weighed fewer than two thousand grams.\nThe boys and girls had an average age of sixteen at the time of the study. They were asked to complete intelligence and motor skill tests in their homes. Their test results were compared with those of other children their age.\nQuestion: What will be mentioned in the following passage?\n- The evaluation method of the tests.\n- The cause of low birth weight babies.\n- The result of the intelligence and motor skill tests.\n- The evidence proving babies began to learn before birth.",

Before that it had been the home of Iron Age tribes known as Celts, and for a time, part of the Roman Empire. Then beginning in the 400s AD, tribes from the north, known as the Engles, the Saxons, and the Jutes, moved in.\nThe most famous leader of this time period in England was Alfred the Great. Alfred lived in Wessex, the kingdom of the West Saxons, which was in the southern part of England. He was a good leader who made his kingdom stronger. He created a system of defenses , called burhs, across the country. He reorganized the army so that his men had time to fight and time to farm. Alfred's efforts protected his people from the Vikings and allowed Wessex to grow. Eventually the rulers of Wessex would rule all of England.\nAlfred also made other improvements. He made laws for his people. He encouraged learning and translated several important books into his Saxon language. This was the beginning of the language we call English today.\nTwo important pieces of literature from that time period are the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Beowulf, both written in Old English. Old English lasted through most of the Middle Ages. Middle English came in during the late Middle Ages, and Modern English began about the time of the Renaissance.\nEngland and English got their names, not from the Saxons, but from one of the other tribes, and Angles. The original name of England must have been something like Angle-land(only in old English of course).",

Pipin and Nemo were balancing on one front flipper , flying through hoops, dancing with the trainer, and we were all applauding -- the little kids screaming with delight. That's when the trainer, who wore a little treat bag on her belt, slipped Pipin and Nemo a fish. Each time they successfully performed a trick, they'd get an immediate reward.\nThese creatures weren't really dancing, of course.

You see how you've spent years jumping through hoops, balancing a ball on your nose, not because it's really who you are, but because you've always done it and the system rewarded you for your performance. But when you've done that for ten or twenty years, you start to ask yourself, \"Whose approval am I working for? What do I really believe?\" Suddenly you see it: you've spent most all your life taking direction from other people. They've told you what to believe in, what to work for, what to value, how to live your life. You don't want to end your life like Sinclair Lewis's George Babbitt, the middle-aged real-estate broker  who has everything and reached the top. But on the last page of Babbitt, George is speaking to his son Ted, who cannot follow in his father's steps.

Maybe I'll want to go back some day, but now, I want to get into mechanics.\" Babbitt, seeming old and subdued, says, \"I've never done a single thing I've wanted to in my whole life!\"\nThe Good-Bye Gate brings us naturally to a second passage, leading from dependency to self-possession.

Lisa, 25, had a lot to do at work,plus visitors on the way: her  parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Lisa felt weak and tired-maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.\nSeveral yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.\nBut when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, \"Oh, my God, she fell in!\" Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. \"No! Not you! \" his girlfriend screamed after him.\nShe was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Lisa, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.\nIt was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Lisa briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.\nLisa thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head.

Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40-minute train ride downtown-just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. \"I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die.\" she explained.\nQuestion: What was the most probable cause for Lisa's weakness?\n- She had run a long way.\n- She felt hot in the subway.\n- She had done a lot of work.\n- She had donated blood the night before.",

They're probably the most hardworking, ambitious people in America and their problems are not properly appreciated.\nPeople like the Secretary of Education simply don't know what they're talking about when they knock students. Nor do those who complain about falling academic standards.\nThe vast majority of the nation's 12 million students are struggling to pay for their educations. They are part of the invisible workforce. Many hold down full-time jobs. They're frying hamburgers, photographing weddings, working in construction, and waiting on tables. The fact that they even show up for classes is a wonderful event.\nThe financial situation of most students explains a lot about what is happening in schools.  Why are the traditional courses so unpopular? Why are students flocking to accounting and computer science and any professional programs that seem to lead to careers?\nAnswer: Today's working student has been forced into a kind of premature matter-of-fact way of viewing things. Romance is gone. The notion of transforming one's self through study alone has disappeared. Today's students seek freedom from manual labor, and the status conferred by a good job.\nThere are other consequences. Today's students don't have much time or energy to be devoted, and carry out independent research or even do serious homework. That's the secret behind falling academic standards. Students have become consumers. They want grades and certifications.  Their professors can't be expected to give a grade of failure to students who are clearly tired from the effort to pay their bills.\nThere's a lot wrong with this situation. It's twisting the definition of education out of shape.  Worse, it's creating a generation that is totally unpleasant. The brightest students turn out to be yuppies  .

He walked directly towards her , entirely forgetting she was not wearing a rose. As John came closer to her, he saw another woman with a red rose stood nearby. Well past 40, this woman had graying hair done under a worn hat. Seeing the girl in green walk quickly away, John felt as if he were split  in two. He desired to follow that girl, but longed for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned and supported him.\nThe woman looked gentle and sensible. John went to her, saying, \"1' m Captain John Blanchard. You must be Miss Maynell. I am glad to meet you here. May I take you to dinner?\"\nShe replied with a smile, I don' t know what this is about.

One legend  dates as far back as the days of  Roman Empire . According to the story, Claudius, the Emperor of Rome, wanted to increase the size of the army. He knew that it would be easier to get young men who were not married to join the army. Therefore, he made a rule that no young men could marry until he had served in the army for a certain number of years.\nA priest  named Valentine broke the rule and secretly married a great number of young people. Finally, Claudius found out about Valentine and put the priest in prison, where he remained until his death on February 14.\n    After his death, Valentine was made a saint  and the day of his death was named Saint Valentine's Day. It became the custom for lovers to send each other message on this day. Now Saint Valentine's Day is a time for people to send one another their greeting of many kinds. \nFebruary 14, Valentine's Day, is sweetheart's day, on which people in love with each other express their tender emotions .\n    People sometimes put their love message in a heart-shaped box of chocolates or a bunch of flowers tied with red ribbons .

        "Read the article and select the best answer.\nArticle: The Basics: First of all, there is nothing basic about this movie. The closest thing to the description this film has is about a Texas family of five struggling to relate and exist together when they are all very different people. They deal with death, fear, growing up, and just making it through a day. However, the story itself is woven into other visuals that make it just a part of what director Terrence Malick is trying to say. If you want something basic, stay away from this movie entirely. But if you're stricken by movies that make you say. \"Wait, huh?\" then you should rush out to see it immediately with someone and plan to hold a summit afterward discussing what it means.\nA Method To His Madness? The loose, disjointed style of the story involved both the 1950s version of the O'Brien family as well as the present-day version of their oldest son Young Jack. There are no solid beginning-middle-ends in any scene; they play out more like a merory or a dream does in your head. Therefore, the audience is left with less of a definitive statement about what's going on, and more of an emotional connection to what they see on screen. We drift through scenes, getting a vague idea that Mr O'Brien is overbearing and Mrs O'Brien is very nurturing , and that the children are growing up with a strong sense of how to move around the imbalance between their parents. Now, throw in scenes of Sean Penn wandering around the high-tech modern city, looking like the rug has been pulled out from underneath his soul. Add in a dash of nature shots, including but not limited to magrna, the ocean, dinosaurs, and hillsides...\nWhat Does It All Mean? It is very clear that Malick wants us to have a sense of this family as a part of the entire universe. A child frightened at his father's touch is a microcosm of the dark expanse above our heads, and it exists alongside the tides, animals, and even God. It all depends on what you believe, which is why this movie is so interesting.\nQuestion: We can learn from the text that the director cares most about  _  .\nOptions: A: something basic that happens in everyday life\nB: how to educate children in different families\nC: something causing people to think and discuss\nD: the importance of protecting endangered anirnals",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: Many people may not believe it, but this is what is happening: polar bears are dying out! They are dying because they are losing a great deal of habitat due to human incursion and global warming.  They are dying because of starvation as well.  With the sea ice they depend on for survival shrinking, it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to find food.\nAn ecosystem is highly dependent on all of its parts, and removing even a single species can result in serious consequences.  Polar bears are at the top of the predators where they live.  They play an important part in the ecosystem.  They feed on seals, fish and deer.  Several other animals depend on the kill of polar bears.  The failure to save polar bears might result in loss of these predators.\nIn addition, all large predators perform a very important function in their habitat: helping to control the populations of other species.  When an animal group loses its natural predators, its population will rise rapidly, having a direct result in population decrease of other groups.  A huge boom in population of Arctic seals would have a direct effect on the prey  of seals, and could reduce numbers of certain types of fish.\nThis could also have a direct effect on humans, who might have to compete with Arctic seals for food supplies from fish. Lack of polar bears could eventually affect human food supply. Human beings shall save polar bears to ensure the food supply.\nThere is no doubt that we should save polar bears.  However, there is still another question: can they be saved? This is a matter that scientists debate because of rapid degradation of the polar bear' environment in recent years due to warming temperatures.  It is estimated that if the bears cannot adapt to changing climates, they might die out before the end of the 21stcentury, with about 50% of the animals disappearing by 2050. So time is running out!\nThere are some things that may help slow down global warming and help delay extinction of polar bears.  These include finding new energy sources...\nQuestion: We can infer that  _  .\nOptions: A: nothing can prevent the extinction of polar bears\nB: drilling for oil in the Arctic should be encouraged\nC: polar bears can surely adapt to changing climates\nD: using solar energy is good for saving polar bears",

        "We were driving on the right road when, all of a sudden, a black car pulled out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver stepped on his brake, skidded , and missed the black car's back end by just inches! The driver of the black car, who almost caused a major accident, turned his head angrily and started shouting bad words at us.\nMy taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. I mean, my taxi driver was friendly. So, I said, \"Why did you just do that? This guy almost ruined your car and sent us to hospital!\" And the following is what my taxi driver told me, which I now call \"the law of the Garbage Truck\".\n\"Many people are like garbage trucks. They run around full of garbage, full of anger, and full of disappointment. As their garbage piles up, they need a place to dump it. And if you let them, they dump it on you. When someone wants to dump on you, don't take it personally. Just smile, wave, wish him well, and move on. Believe me. You'll be happier.\"\nSo this is \"The Law of the Garbage Truck\". I started thinking: How often do I let \"Garbage Trucks\" run right over me? And how often do I take their garbage and spread it to other people at work, at home, or on the streets? It was then that I said, \"I'm not going to do it any more.\"\nI began to see \"Garbage Trucks\". I see _ they're carrying. I see them coming to drop it off. And like my taxi driver, I don't make it a personal thing; I just smile, wave, and move on.\nGood leaders know they have to be ready for their next meeting. Good parents know that they have to welcome their children home from school with hugs and kisses. What about you? The mark of a successful person is how quickly he can get back his focus on what's important.\nThe reason why the taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy is that   _  .\nA) the black car was full of garbage\nB) the taxi driver didn't want his mood ruined\nC) the driver of the black car didn't cause any damage to the taxi\nD) the driver of the black car was angry and the taxi driver felt a little frightened",

That is because in this world some people drive very crazily. Also, most people who use cellphones to talk in the car usually pay more attention to what they are talking about than to driving. One of the reasons that I feel this way is that ny friend had a car accident while using a cellphone. He lost his life and his friends did, too.\nRodrigo Cruz from Colombia: That depends. The a dvantages of using a cellphone while driving are that you can call the police if there is a car accident, call for help when somebody's car breaks down, and call when somebody needs something before arriving home or at the office. The disadvantages is that people get distracted  when they are driving at the same time they are talking on a cellular phone. It can cause car accidents.\nCarl Khalid from Saudi Arabia: No. I would recommend if you want to use a cellphone while you're driving, pull over and take your time. You will avoid a  lot of trouble. There are many advantages of using cellphones in cars. In emergencies such as accidents, a flat  tire or engine problem, the cellphone is useful for calling 911 for help. Using the cellphone while driving can save time, but using it while driving can alsocause a lot of problems such as missing a red light or signs, not observing cars, or not paying attention to the speed limit. It causes a lot of problems. All these problems could cause loss of concentration.\nMirna Hazim: Yes. A cellphone is helpful; it is one of the most important communication devices. For example, if you want to talk with somebody for an important reason, you can. One time when I was coming back from work at 10 o'clock at night, I had a problem with my car. It wouldn't move. I was scared to go into a store to call my brother because I didn't know  the places there. I thought it could be dangerous.

Instead, as they see it, solutions must develop from a better understanding of the humans that drive the system and from a fuller appreciation of the limits and potential  of the earth's resources.\nWhat this means is an increased emphasis on the life and earth sciences, on sociology, psychology, economics and even philosophy.\nMore and more of the best minds in science, particularly young researchers, are being drawn into these developing fields.\nAll this is not to say that technological creativity will not play a critical role in solving energy and food shortages, or that answers to environmental difficulties will not come from further advances in the same technologies that may have helped cause the problems.\nWhere the real challenge lies, in the view of the new generation of scientists, is in finding ways to produce goods and meet the world's needs, using less of the raw materials that are becoming short.\nQuestion: Which of the following would the author probably agree with?\n- The environment crisis will not be solved unless we stop using virgin materials.\n- In scientific research, a higher priority should be given to understanding all living systems.\n- Exploration of outer space will finally lead to an improvement on human living conditions.\n- U.

The loss of opportunities for outdoor play is one of the main causes of childhood obesity. What is more remarkable is the growing evidence that children's mental health and emotional well-being are enhanced by contact with the outdoors, and that the restorative  effect appears to be strongest in natural settings. Researchers are convinced of the depth of the connection between children's well-being and the environment, claiming that contact with nature may be as important to children as good nutrition and adequate sleep.\nBut now children seem to get less touch with outdoor activities. The root causes of the dramatic loss of children's freedom lie in changes to the very fabric of their lives over the last 30 years or so. The growth in road traffic, alongside poor town planning and shifts in the make-up and daily rhythms of families and communities, have left children with fewer outdoor places to go. These changes coincided with the \"culture of fear\": a generalized anxiety about all imaginary kinds of threats, even though children are statistically safer from harm now than at any point in human history.\nThese physical, economic and social changes and fears have been made use of by manufactures and advertisers, whose products and messages both reinforce the logic of keeping children virtual prisoners, and force us to compensate them in the only way our cash-rich, time-poor society seems to know: by spending money on them.\nGovernment must bear some of the blame for keeping children prisoners indoor, through their promotion of planning policies that favour cars over communities and profit over people. The real planning crimes lie in housing companies occupying attractive parks and green spaces, and in town plans that force families to depend largely on their cars. There is no doubt that traffic danger, unlike stranger danger, is a real threat to children and a constant worry for parents. \nAround 100 child pedestrians  are killed...\nQuestion: Governments have not helped the situation because   _  .\nOptions: A: they do not make enough profit\nB: people prefer to buy cars\nC: there are too many housing companies\nD: they limit transport means.",

        "Article: Data on British buying habits in 2015 reveals a move away from products such as sausages and bacon in favour of fish and poultry .\nThe move may be because high-end consumers are noticing growing warnings about their impact on health. That was reinforced by an assessment by the World Health Organization in October that placed cured and processed meats in the same category as asbestos, alcohol, arsenic and tobacco as major causes of cancer.\nSales of sausages and bacon were down 14.4% last year compared with 2014 and sales of red meat fell by 8.1%. In contrast, sales of poultry and fish rose by 13.1% and 25.1% respectively.\nThe sustained interest in organic food is driven by an increase in young and socially conscious\"millennials\"(born from the early 1980s to the early 2000s) with strong social, ethical and environmental values. They are prepared to pay extra for healthier options and shifting shopping patterns away from\"the big weekly shop\"in favour of\"a few and often\".\nAt Tesco sales of organic fruit and vegetables have risen by more than 18% over the last year -- double the market average. Tesco fruit commercial manager Gareth Wilcock said,\"The revival of organic foods has been gathering pace over the last few years, with lower prices and better availability both playing a major part in that.\"\nGeorge Scott, food and grocery analyst with Verdict Retail, said,\"Organic food is no longer niche   and I think this upward sales trend is here to stay. It is very significant that we have acute consumers who are prepared to trade up to the foods where they want the best quality and assurances of provenance.\"\nQuestion: What does the World Health Organization think of processed meats?\nYes or no, is the answer \"They're likely to cause cancer.\"?",

He was badly crippled  ,and when we would walk together,his hand on my arm for balance,people would stare,I would be ashamed of the unwanted attention.\nIt was difficult to walk together--and because of that,we didn't say much as we went along. But as we started out,he always said,\"You set the pace. I will try to follow you.\"\nOur usual walk was to or from the subway,which was how he got to work. He went to work sick,and even in bad weather. He almost never missed a day,and would make it to the office even if others could not. It was a matter of pride for him.\nWhen snow or ice was on the ground,it was impossible for him to walk,even with help. At such times my sister or I would pull him through the streets of Brooklyn,N.Y.,on a child's sleigh to the subway entrance. Once there,he would try to grasp handrail until he reached the lower steps that the warmer tunnel air kept ice free. In Manhattan the subway station was the basement of his office building,and he would not have to go outside again until we met him in Brooklyn on his way home.\nWhen I think of it now,I am surprised at how much courage it must have taken for a grown man to suffer from shame and disability. And I am also surprised at how he did it--without bitterness or complaint.\nHe never talked about himself as an object of pity,nor did he show any envy of the more fortunate or able.

But to a five-year old, he was a giant.\n   Once again, I was caught in the middle of circumstances. The fourth born of six children, it was not uncommon that I was either too young or too old for something. This night I was both. While my two baby brothers slept inside the house, my three older siblings played with friends around the corner, where I was not allowed to go. I stayed with Grandpa, and that was okay with me. I was where I wanted to be.\n   \"Thirsty?\" Grandpa asked.  \"Yes\" was my reply.\n   \"Would you like to run over to the gas station there and get yourself a bottle of Coke?\" I couldn't believe my ears. On my family's modest income, Coke was not a part of our budge or diet. A few sips were all I had ever had, and certainly never my own bottle.\n   \"Okay,\" I replied shyly.\n   Opening his fist, Grandpa instructed me to pick out a dime.\n   \"Okay,\" he said, \" I'm going to stay here and I'll tell you when It's safe to cross. You go over to the Coke machine, get your Coke and come back out. Wait for me to tell you when it's safe to cross back.\"\n   My heart pounded. Grandpa held my hand tightly. When he told me it was safe to cross, I ran faster than I had ever run before.\nReaching the other side, I turned to find Grandpa. There he was, standing exactly where I had left him, smiling proudly. I waved. \"Go on, hurry up,\" he yelled.\nCoke in hand, I proudly marched back out into the early evening dusk. Grandpa was waiting patiently. He smiled. \"Come on, now,\" he said, \"run.\" I did.\"\n\"Don't ever do that alone, he warned. I held the Coke bottle tightly, fearful he would make me pour it into a cup, ruining my dream. He didn't. One lone swallow of the cold drink cooled my sweating body. I don't think I ever felt so proud.\nQuestion: What did the author fear after getting back from the gas station?\nOptions: A: He wouldn't be allowed to buy a Coke again.\nB: He would be made to drink the Coke with a cup instead of a bottle.\nC: Grandpa would get him to cross the street alone once again.\nD: The Coke was too cold for him to drink.",

Here's why:\nCBS picked 1,799 samples  to take the test in TV studios in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Los Angeles. More than two out of five of the drivers failed the test. And the average score was the lowest passing mark-51 points out of a possible 80.\nChicago drivers did best with an average of 53 points. Los Angeles drivers came next with 52 points. New York and Philadephia drivers tied  with 50 points-a failing score. Drivers with 50 points or less were rated  \"poorly informed\" by the judges.\nHere are some of the test results:\n(1) Are men better informed drivers than women?-Yes. Men averaged 52 points. Women got average of 49.\n(2) Are older drivers better informed than younger drivers?-No. Drivers under 26 averaged 52 points. Drivers from 27 to 45 averaged 51. Driver over 45 failed with 48 points on average.\n(3) Does education make a difference?-Yes. College graduates averaged 52 points. High school graduates averaged 50. Those without high school diplomas  got 48. And people who had taken driver education courses scored an average of 53 points-three more than those who hadn't.\n(4) Does driving experience make a difference?-Yes. Drivers with three or more years' experience averaged 51 points. Drivers with less experience averaged 49.\nHere are some surprising facts brought out by the test:\n(1)More than one out of three drivers did not know that a blinking  red light means a full stop. (2)Three out of ten drivers did not know that an octagonal (eight-sided) sign means stop.\n(3)More than two of three drivers did not know what to do when being \"tailgated\"(,) The answer: slow down, drive to the right, and let the driver behind pass.\nThe results of the test were turned over to the National Safety Council. They will help future safety planning.\nQuestion: The author's purpose is to   _  .\nOptions: A: prove that men are better drivers than women\nB: give you safe driving tips\nC: tell you the results of a national drivers test.\nD: urge you to get an education.",

Of course, it is possible. You can communicate your moods and intentions to one another without words, because all human beings share a lot of common visual signals. These signals are as effective as words during communication.\nThe gestures of the head play a key role in body language. The movements of eyes and eyebrows are as important as head movements in body language.\nBesides the gestures of the head or the movements of the eyes and eyebrows, the action of arms, hands and legs is also a large part of body language. Extending one's arm and shaking hands with others is a greeting in both formal and informal cases. This part of body language might date back to primary tribes .\nLike handshaking, there are still many other forms of body language presented by hands. Raising one's hand and making a circle with his thumb and for finger signals, that something is OK. Clasped hands raised above the head, a traditional picture accepted by sportsmen after winning a fight, is a display of triumph that grows out of a kind of feeling following a victory. Waving one's hands, a speaker can make his words more powerful and vigorous .\nBesides hand gestures, there are times when a person says something with his legs as well as with his head and eyes. The leg gestures often reflect one's attitude towards something or someone that person is with.\nAccording to the above facts, body language has offered a more reliable way to understand one's mind by means of gestures. Though it is soundless and wordless, once you understand it, you will feel the world is bigger than you realized.\nQuestion: After reading the passage we can conclude that   _  .\n- hand shaking suggests that the speaker is excited\n- head plays a less important part in body language\n- actors and actresses are good at gestures\n- people began to use body language long long ago",

There are many reasons behind this. Let's take a look at a few of them.\nFor some parents, they have religious   reasons for home-schooling. The public school system does not have religious teachings, so these parents want to put religion into the children's daily school activities. This might include teaching religion-based courses rather than coursework that is taught in public schools.\nFor some parents, they do not feel that their local school system offers their children the best learning opportunities. So they want to take matters into their own hands. This may be because the local school has low educational standards   or for some other reason the parents think it necessary to take their children out of the system. Sometimes the parents just feel the children will get a better education at home.\nSome parents may not be rich enough to send their children to a private school, so the next best thing in their eyes is home-schooling. Thus they can teach their children what they like.\nOne should remember that the laws about home-schooling _ from state to state. In some states, the parents are required to hand in monthly attendance records   to their local school system. What's more, most states require state testing at certain periods such as the CRCT.\nQuestion: The writer wrote this passage mainly to   _  .\nAnswer:",

These cave systems form in carbonate rock, often on islands. Some blue holes have very special rock formations and water chemistry. Far below sea level, they contain some of the harshest environments on Earth, with no oxygen and no light. Yet these areas are filled with life forms that have adapted to the extreme conditions.\nInformation gathered from these blue holes is helping scientists to increase their understanding of biology, archaeology and geology. But exploring these blue hole environments brings danger as well as discovery.\n Blue holes get their name from the color1 some have when seen from the air. The color1 is usually a reflection of the sky on the water. But not all of these cave systems have blue surfaces. Some contain dark or muddy water.\nBlue holes are the result of erosion in which water breaks down rock. Rain falling thousands of years ago contained chemicals which slowly wore away at the limestone landmass. These holes were later filled with sea water as the sea level changed. The rising and falling of sea levels and the mixture of salt and fresh water further wore away at these cave formations. Blue holes are vertical caves. But they can also have horizontal cave formations that may be hundreds of meters long.\n These flooded cave systems can be found in the ocean, or they can be found inland. Ocean caves are affected by tides, so they always have water movement. But blue holes on land are very still. They have several layers of water, chemicals, and bacteria. The top layer of fresh water comes from rainfall. This layer acts like a cap on top of the layered mixture, and keeps out oxygen from the atmosphere. The fresh water floats on a denser layer of saltwater. Underneath this is a layer of poisonous hydrogen sulfide, produced by bacteria living in the water. Underneath this layer is anoxic seawater -- water that does not contain any oxygen.\n Underwater caves are probably one of the least explored ecosystems...",

The ladies who had the courage to drink 10 or more cups of coffee a day progressed even better. They reduced their risk of diabetes by 79 percent. The men participating in the studies also reduced their risk, but not to the extent as did the women. When men drank three to four cups a day, they reduced their risk of diabetes by 27 percent. The men who drank 10 or more cups of java per day reduced their risk by 55 percent.\nThese results confirm a January report by the equally 'prestigious' Harvard School of Public Health. That report concluded that drinking six 8-ounce cups of coffee a day could reduce diabetes risk in men by about 50 percent and in women by 30 percent.\nIf the numbers have any connection to reality, the more coffee you drink, the better off you are. And that is the rub. The numbers have nothing to do with reality, nothing to do with the truth. Here in America the rate of adult-onset diabetes, or Type 2 diabetes, is growing increasingly. Nowadays it typically shows up in middle-age populations, but the disease is on the rise among ever-younger age groups.\nDo not step up your coffee consumption in the belief it will help you prevent diabetes. This disease has  ly nothing to do with a lack of coffee drinking.\nScience and truth are not synonymous. Medical scientists do not deal with truth. The medical scientists who monkey around with coffee drinking merely play with limited and approximate descriptions of reality. In this case, extremely limited and hardly approximate.\nIf you are serious about preventing diabetes, you have to look at the differences between the people...\nQuestion: What is the writer's attitude towards the result about the research on diabetes?\n- The writer believes it.\n- The writer is delighted to know it.\n- The writer doesn't believe it.\n- The writer is annoyed to know it.",

I don't think the translation is an accurate one, since it doesn't only belong to lovers. Valentine's Day is for expressing affection of all sorts. But it is uniquely for the romantically involved who shine the brightest, who spend the most money, whose hearts are the most engaged.\nWhen I was b boy, my mother would buy enough cheap cards with ugly drawings of butterflies and little rabbits and honeybees for me to give one to every kid in my class, about 20 or so. The cards came in bags, and each card had a few foolish words-\"Be Mine\" or \"I like you\" or \"You've Got My Heart\" or the uninteresting words, \"Hi, Valentine!\" I would sign my name on the cards quickly and the name of one of my classmates on each easily-broken envelope. I would lick  each one shut, but they were so cheap that the envelopes rarely had enough glue. On Valentine's Day, I would take the cards to school-everyone did. We would have a party in our classroom, with cupcakes and juice and tiny candy hearts, which also had Valentine messages printed on them-\"You're sweet\" or \"Cupid \"or \"Love\".\nAh, love! That's the Valentine's Day message: love. No one knows for certain the origin of the holiday. Several, Catholic victims were named Valentine, but it's difficult to separate legend from fact.

Each culture celebrates this festival in a different way. \n    The Jewish Festival of Light is called Hanukkah. It usually takes place in December. The story of why Hanukkah is celebrated is very old. It is told that a long time ago, Jewish people called the Macabees were at war with a country called Syria. On the day that the Macabees won the war, they cleaned up their holy place, which is called a temple, because the Syrian people had been living there. They wanted to light their holy lamps to say thank you for the end of the year, but found only a very small amount of oil left over to do that. The Macabees lit the lamps anyway, thinking that they would soon go out. The lamps kept burning for eight days! The Jewish people celebrate Hanukkah every year by lighting a candlestick that has eight candleholders. Every night a new candle is lit so that on the eighth night, all eight candles stand together. Presents are given at this time and money is given to the poor. \n    The Christmas story is not quite as old as the Hanukkah story, but it is also very old. Christmas is the time when Christians around the world celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. It is believed that Christ was born in a stable. On the night of his birth, angels, shepherds and three wise men visited him. The wise men brought gifts with them. This is a happy and busy time of the year. Homes are decorated with Christmas trees and decorations. It is a time for being with the family. Families travel long distances to gather at Christmas. Lots of lights are put up everywhere. This is to show that Jesus is the\"Light of the world\"who came to bring peace to all people. \n    Lanterns are another form of light. In China, the Lantern Festival goes back to the Han Dynasty.

        "Read the article and select the best answer.\nArticle: You have the ability to decide if you are happy or not. Happiness is a choice.\nYou can't depend on someone else to make you happy. That is a lesson I learned early on in my marriage. I realized that I couldn't rely on my husband as my source of happiness. I learned that my happiness depended on me and not my husband's actions. I learned that you have to choose to be happy.\nYou can choose your emotions. True happiness comes from within; it can't be forced by outside forces. So how do you choose happiness? The same way you choose to smile or choose to wear a certain outfit. You choose it because that's what you want to experience in your life.\nYou want to buy a new pair of shoes so you choose a pair that you like and feel good. You wouldn't buy a pair of shoes that you don't like or that don't fit well, right? So why do we keep choosing emotions and feelings that don't make us feel good?\nChoosing to be happy after you realize your anger has shown up (or even choosing to be calm) can be beneficial. We choose our feelings; no one can do that for us. If we let others get to us, influence our emotions - we are giving them power over us. When others cause us anger or pain, we are giving them our power.\nWe need to keep our feelings in check and not react automatically to what is thrown at us. We need to think our actions out instead of just reacting to what someone says or does.\nRemember that we can always choose happiness. At first it will be difficult to just switch your thoughts and feelings from anger, self-doubt, or fear to joy and happiness. But it is only a thought away. Don't dwell on what happens to you unnecessarily but realize what is causing you to feel that way. Realize that thoughts, feelings and emotions can change. Then move on and choose to be happy.\nQuestion: The writer suggests that we should   _  .\nOptions: A: let others control our feelings\nB: respond immediately to others' words\nC: pay more attention to words than actions\nD: hold back our feelings properly",

As students we must put more efforts into our lessons so as to serve society and our nation in the future.\nBut it is a pity that there are a lot of people who do not know the importance of time. They spend their precious time smoking, drinking and chatting. They do not realize that wasting time is equal , we should form the good habit of saving time. Do not put off   what can be done today until tomorrow.\nQuestion: Which is the best example to make full use of time?\nOptions: A: Putting off what can be done today for next day.\nB: Putting some precious time away.\nC: Devoting our efforts into our work at the moment.\nD: Putting some time into our work.",

The first exam was held in 1995, and since then more and more people have signed up for it, with applications reaching a peak over the last two years.\nThe latest online survey, carried out by China Youth Daily and www.qq.com, found that more than 73 percent of young people want to work as civil servants. Of the 17,330 respondents, about 83 percent said they were attracted by the job's stability, guaranteed health care and pension . Meanwhile, 55 percent said it could bring \"practical profits\". Nearly 1 million people applied to take the exam last year, yet only just over 10,000 were finally employed.\nThis year the competition continued. The exact number of applicants is not known, with the final day for applications today. But the flood of applicants has already broken the exam's website once. China Youth Daily reported that the site was forced to close for  _ due to unusually high traffic on the night of October 16, which has never happened in the past.\nIn a typical year several hundred applicants will apply for many of the jobs listed. For example, the five job vacancies provided by the secretariat   of the Central Committee of the CPC have attracted more than 3,880 applicants this year. Positions as civil servants are attractive, not only because of the stable income and good health care, but also because of the low risks compared with the power and resources the positions enjoy. Among the total 6 million public servants, around 20,000 were dismissed between 1996 and 2007.\nQuestion: What would be the best title for the passage?\nOptions: A: Advantages of civil servants\nB: Deadline for applications\nC: Many applicants for one position\nD: Civil servant exam turns tougher",

Japan and North Korea have had tense relations over unresolved issues, some of them dating back 100 years. The three leaders emphasized the importance of cooperation in dealing with North Korea.\nThe meeting took place Tuesday in the Hague, after a twoday nuclear security summit. President Obama praised South Korean President Park Geunhye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for overcoming their differences to discuss a serious threat to regional peace. He emphasized the importance of cooperation on the North Korean nuclear issue.\nObama said the three discussed steps to deepen diplomatic  and military cooperation, including joint military exercises and missile  defense against Pyongyang. He said further discussions would take place next month, during his visits to Seoul and Tokyo.\nThe South Korean president stressed the importance of a united response to North Korea, but also called on the North to choose a peaceful path. \"I sincerely hope that this meeting will offer a chance for us to reconfirm our trilateral  coordination and strengthen the cooperation on the nuclear front,\" said Park.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed. \"Particularly it is extremely important that we were able to confirm close cooperation among Japan, the United States and the Republic of Korea on the issue of North Korea, the three countries who would like to cooperate so that North Korea will be able to take a positive position with regard to nuclear and missile issue,\" said Abe.\nJapan and South Korea have several unresolved issues, including Japan's refusal to apologize again for crimes committed 70 years ago.

As a result, there has been a growing interest in natural foods: foods which do not contain chemical additives  and which have not been affected by chemical fertilizers , widely used in farming today.\nNatural foods, for example, are vegetables, fruit and grain which have been grown in soil that is rich in organic matter. In simple words, this means that the soil has been nourished(...) by unused vegetable matter, which provides it with vitamins and minerals. This in itself is a natural process compared with the use of chemicals and fertilizers, the main purpose of which is to increase the amount--but not the quality--of foods grown in commercial farming area.\nNatural foods also include animals which have been allowed to feed move freely in healthy pastures . Compare this with what happens in the mass production of poultry :there are battery farms, for example, where thousands of chickens live crowded together in one building and are fed on food which is little better than rubbish. Chickens kept in this way are not only tasteless as food; they also produce eggs which lack important vitamins.\nThere are other sides of healthy eating which are now receiving increasing attention from experts on diet. Take, for example, the question of sugar. This is actually unnecessary food. It is not that sugar is harmful in itself. But it does seem to be addictive: the quantity we use has grown steadily over the last two centuries and in Britain today each person consumes an average of 200 pounds a year! Yet all it does is provide us with energy, in the form of calories. There are no vitamins in it, no minerals, and no fibre.\nQuestion: Chickens raised in poultry farms are all of the following EXCEPT that   _  .\nAnswer:",

It appeared on some of the first postcards, starred in some of the earliest silent movies, and was the subject of a couple of the earliest photos, dating all the way back to the 1800s. I discovered even more about one of humanity's earliest forms of life art during several years of research around the world.\nFor example, snowmen were a phenomenon in the Middle Ages, built with great skill and thought. At a time of limited means of expression, snow was like free art supplies dropped from the sky. It was a popular activity for couples to leisurely walk through town to view the temporary works of chilly art. Some were created by famous artists, including a 19-year-old Michelangelo, who in 1494 was appointed by the ruler of Florence, Italy, to build a snowman in his mansion's courtyard.\nThe Miracle of 1511 took place during six freezing works called the Winter of Death. The city of Brussels was covered in snowmen--an impressive scene that told stories on every street corner. Some were political in nature, criticizing the church and government. Some were a reflection of people's imagination. For the people of Brussels, this was a defining moment of defining freedom. At least until spring arrived, by which time they were dealing with damaging floods.\nIf you fear the heyday of the snowman has passed, don't worry: I've learned that some explosive snowman history is still being made today. Every year since 1818, the people of Zurich, Switzerland, celebrate the beginning of spring by blowing up a snowman. On the third Monday of April, the holiday Sechselauten is kicked off when a cotton snowman called the Boogg is stuffed with explosive and paraded through town by bakers and other tradesmen who throw bread to the crowds. The parade ends with the Boogg being placed on a 40-foot pile of firewood.

Rather than trying to hide our shame or embarrassment, experts found that we are simply less aware when our actions result in a negative outcome.\nThe research may explain why we often feel it hard to take the blame for our actions. \"Our result suggests that people may really experience less responsibility for negative than for positive outcomes,\" said Patrick Haggard, leading researcher and professor of the institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London.\nIn a series of tests, participants were asked to press a key. A sound then followed, either disapproving, neutral or approving, and they were then asked to estimate the time between the action and when they had heard the sound.\nResearchers found that individuals experienced different levels of responsibility depending on the outcomes. They also discovered they were significantly slower to recognize if their actions had resulted in a bad consequence, compared to when they had done well.\n\"Effectively, we have found that we experience a negative outcome differently, not just retell it differently. We make a weaker connection when there is a bad result. And respond much more strongly when something good happens,\" said Professor Haggard. When something goes right, everyone wants to take the credit, and when things go wrong, nobody is interested in putting their hands up.\nThe researchers said our brain is \"very much concerned\" with reward, as good results are key to survival. Although our own perception   of whether we are guilty of something or not is changed by the outcomes, this does not provide a defense if we have done something wrong. \"Our experience of our own responsibilities can be misleading and can be strongly colored by the outcomes of our actions,\" said Professor Haggard. \"We have to take responsibility for what we actually do, not just for how we experience things.\"\nOptions:\nA By giving examples.\nB By quoting research findings.\nC By making comparison.\nD By providing data.\nAnswer:\nB By quoting research findings.\nQuestion:",

Now Barbie is known everywhere. Before Barbie, all dolls were made to look like babies. People thought that this was a way to teach young girls how to become a good mother. Barbie was the first doll made to look like an adult instead of baby.\nFrom the beginning, Barbie was a modern career  girl. There was a different Barbie for each job: nurse, teacher, police officer, race car driver, professional basketball player, pilot, as well as the very first female to fly in space. Barbie made it possible for young girls to dream about a future other than being a mother and a housewife. It showed girls that they had choices and could become anything they wanted to be. At the time, these ideas were very new and positive. The movement for equal opportunity  for women had just begun and women wanted to have the same chance as men to do important work.\nHowever, Barbie's approval  as a role model has not lasted. Today, many people criticize  Barbie for making young girls too concerned about their appearance . These people complain that the beautiful, well-dressed Barbie seems to tell girls that while they can hope to have different career, it is more important for them to be beautiful and thin. The female figure that Barbie represents has also been criticized for being unrealistic . Young girls might think that Barbie's figure is beautiful and desirable .

He started up an Internet marble company where he sells the toys. And recently the 8-year-old student was written into the record books for being the youngest founder and chief executive officer   (CEO) of an Internet company.\n  Harli's love for marbles got rolling when he was 6. According to Tina, Harli's mother, he loved the colcorful toys so much that he would go to sleep talking about marbles and the first thing in the morning he did was talking about marbles. And his family started calling him \"the Marble King\".\n  \"I like the patterns   and designs of marbles. You can collect hundreds of different color1s, shaps, and sizes. It's fun,\" Harli told WR News. \"And I really enjoy looking at them, touching them, holding them, studying them and playing them with my friends.\"\n  Harli Jordean's marble company has a long history. After losing his marbles to an older boy, Harli and his mom turned to the Internet for ordering more marbles. However, they couldn't find a Web site that sold the toys. That gave Harli an idea-to start a Web site where people could find different types of marbles. With his family's help, Harli created a Web site that sells marbles and marble accessories.

In fact, some stories are amazing, especially when animals are meeting with people. Here are two stories that interest me.\n  James, a wildlife writer, told a story that an African woman had placed her baby in the shade of a tree while she was working. An elephant group walked by and saw the baby. Several elephants pulled leafy branches from the tree covered the sleeping baby. Flies can be a problem in Africa and the branches protected the baby from the flies. The elephants were so gentle and quiet that they did not even wake up the baby. Then the elephants walked away. \n  An English magazine offers another story. Bill, a cat, stayed at home while its master was away on a trip, but the man was injured in a railway accident and died a few days later in a hospital. At the funeral, the Man's brother was surprised to see that Bill was there. The faithful cat had traveled a long way to the hospital, looked at the coffin , and then sadly returned home. \n  Humans are only one part of the earth. The beautiful flowers are our sisters; the deer, the horses and the great eagles, these are our brothers. The sky and mountains, the cows and men, all belong to the same family.

No matter why your child has become picky, how you handle the situation can affect his or her future. Therefore, you should know the following reasons for picky children first of all.\n _ is common in children; it often happens at the dinner table. Some children just refuse to try new food because they don't know what it will taste like, while others dislike new food before even smelling it. Some children take it to the extreme  and will only eat a few foods that they like. Psychologist Dr. Elizabeth Capaldi says that, by the time children reach the age of two, they have formed their own eating habits that they don't want to be disturbed by new offerings at the table.\nA newly published study led by Dr. Lucy Cooke of University College London showed that picky eating in children results from genetic  and environmental causes. The research, which followed the eating habits of 5,390 pairs of twins between the ages of 8 and 11, found that about 75% of the neophobia in the children was from their parents, while 25% was due to the influence of environment.\nChildren grow at a high speed during their first year, but that fast-paced growth tends to slow down by their second year. When children are not experiencing one of those fast growth periods, their body needs less energy; and that results in a smaller appetite . When children are not hungry, they tend to enjoy only food they like. They refuse new food and food that is not their favourite. Some children will limit the amount of food to only one kind, like hamburgers or pancakes, leaving all the other foods untouched.\nIn some cases, many real reasons why a child behaves as a picky eater exist. About 5% of children who are 10 years of age or younger have some type of neurological dysfunction  that influences their eating habits. These children may be easily hurt by some special smells, or their brain may not be able to process such sensory information properly.\nQuestion: What can we learn about the study led by Dr. Cooke?\nOptions: A: It paid more attention to the environmental effects on children's eating habits.\nB: It followed the eating habits of 5,390 children aged between 8 and 11.\nC: It showed that genetics greatly affect children's eating habits.\nD: It suggested that parents should have good eating habits.",

The repetitive action of working your fingers across the keyboard of your cell phone can cause some of the same chronic   pain problems previously limited to those who'd spent a lifetime typing.\nThe possible connection is particularly worrying considering how much teens and young adults -- and increasingly those in professional settings -- are texting nowadays, said Judith Gold, who carried out one of the first studies on the potential connection.\nText messaging is a fairly new technology, Gold says, so this is a new area of research for those who study ergonomics  . But \"considering the similarities in body position, findings from research on overuse injuries from computers could be applicable\" to texting.\n\"The way the body is positioned for texting - fixed shoulders and back with rapidly moving fingers - is similar to the position for typing on a computer,\" Gold explained. Previous research has found pain in the elbow connected with too much thumb texting. \nTo look for a broader link between texting and chronic pain, Gold and her colleagues sent a questionnaire to 138 college students, asking them to report the number of text messages they sent per day (in four categories: 0, 1-10, 11-20, 21+ messages) and to point out any discomfort they felt on a body map.\nThe research showed an association between the number of text messages sent per day and shoulder discomfort. The effect seemed to be particularly pronounced in males, though Gold says she doesn't know why that would be.\n\"What we've seen so far is very similar to what we see with office workers who've spent most of their time at a computer,\" Gold said. However, Gold's study did not take account of the amount of time the people surveyed also spent typing on computers, which could be affecting the results.\nQuestion: In the past, who usually suffered from a pain in the neck according to the passage?\nYes or no, is the answer \"A typist\"?",

At cheek-in, you might consider asking for a room near the elevator so you won't need to walk down long, potentially ill-lit hallways to reach your room. When filling out guest registration forms, consider using your first initial instead of your name, and skip the\" Mrs/Miss/Mr\" check box. Additionally, make sure the clerk writes down your room number instead of saying it out loud. This will prevent anyone nearby from knowing where to find you later.\nArrive during the day\nArrive in new cities during the day. Areas around bus and train stations can be scary and/ojr deserted, and small towns tend to shut down early. Veteran solo traveler Mara Rothman of San Francisco notes that plenty of beautiful towns can appear mysterious at night, and locals who are genuinely trying to help you can appear unnecessarily threatening. Arriving during the day means you'll be able to find a place to stay and get to know where you are before dark.\nKeep your documents safe \nIf you choose to wear a money belt, use it for storage and not as a purse. Constantly reaching under your shirt for money draws attention to it, and tends to defeat the purpose. Instead,keep your passport, extra stores of money, and other important documents well hidden, and use a bag or purse for carrying daily spending money.\nDress appropriately\nTo avoid attracting unwanted attention, dress as conservatively as the women you see around you. This doesn't necessarily mean wearing the traditional dress, as that can sometimes have the opposite result. A good rule of thumb is to dress modestly. Think knee-length or longer skirts. Bare arms, shoulders, and legs are considered risked in some countries, so do the research before you go and once you're there. Note which body parts the local women cover and do the same. \nKnow when to make friends \nTraveling alone doesn't always mean being alone.

The company claims on its site that the vehicle \"transforms in seconds from an automobile to an airplane\" by using \"existing infrastructure created for automobiles and planes.\"The vehicle is petrol-powered and has wings that fold, which allows it to be parked like a car, though it is nearly 20 feet long.\nThe company's website features a video where the AeroMobil 3. 0 drives out of a hangar (  )and goes down a highway, sharing the road with ordinary cars until it arrives at an airstrip. The car then unfolds its wings and takes off from a stretch of grass, rather than a paved tarmac  , and flies through the air like any other small airplane.\nAeroMobil spokesman Stefan Vadocz said his company hasn't decided on an exact price because it's not ready yet.\"The prototype is a work in progress,\" he said in an email. But he said the price would be several hundreds of thousands of euros---somewhere in between a sports car and a light sports aircraft.\nThe vehicle seats two people---the pilot and a passenger---and its single propeller   is located at the rear of the plane. The company said the car's top speed on the road is at least 99 mph and while flying it is at least 124 mph. It can fly for 435 miles before running out of fuel. It has a steel framework and carbon coating and is powered by a Rotax 912, a four-cylinder   aircraft engine from BRP of Austria.\nFlying cars aren't exactly new.

It is now understood that any normal person, finding him or herself for an extended time in a new culture, is in for trouble.\nThe process of \"culture shock\" is now recognized as so predictable that its four stages have been noticeable. The first is the honeymoon stage, familiar to those of us who love to travel, but never stay in one place long enough to find out what follows. In this stage, the new country and its people seem delightful. Everything is better than home. Everything is so different and charming.\n _ Now the people start to look shallow, selfish and stupid. The different ways of doing things don't seem interesting any more. You start to feel tired all the time. Culture shock has set in. You feel at sea.\nThe emotional response to culture shock in stage two can be extreme. Confusion, depression and anxiety, and resentment can all enter to varying degrees. You may become physically ill. Little things seem terribly annoying.\nThe happier resolution is to move on to stage three. Adjusting. Rather than itemizing  what's \"wrong\" with Americans, you remind yourself that \"right\" and \"wrong\" are not meaningful terms in cultural matters.\nInstead, you try to understand what motivates Americans, perhaps realizing that many of the things you don't like are related to the things you do like.\nAs time goes on, you should be moving into stage four. Acceptance. At this point, you simply don't think any more about the specialties of Americans. You accept them as individuals. You have started to feel at home; you know how to do things. You have not rejected your old culture; but the American ways have settled upon you. You feel optimistic about your future here. You have truly arrived.\nQuestion: Which one is the possible psychological effect of culture shock on the second stage?\nOptions: A: Anxiety.\nB: Excitement.\nC: Shock.\nD: Delight.",

Our discomfort comes not so much from the thing itself; it comes from our umamiliarity with it.After all, an oyster has remarkably the same look as a sheep's eye; and a first look at a lobster would remind almost anybody of a creature from a science fiction movie, not something you dip in butter and eat.By the way, in Saudi Arabia sheep's eyes are a famous dish and in parts of China it's bear's paw soup.\nCan you refuse such food without being rude? Most experienced business travelers say no, at least not before taking at least a few bites.It helps, though, to slice any item very thin.This way, you minimize the taste and the reminder of where it came from.Or, \" Swallow it quickly, \" as one traveler recommends.\"I still can't tell you what sheep's eyeballs taste like.\" As for dealing with taste, the old line that \"it tastes just like chicken\" is often thankfully true.Even when the \"it\" is really rat or snake.\nAnother useful piece of advice is not knowing what you are eating.What's for dinner? Don't ask. Avoid glancing into the kitchen or looking at English-language menus.Your host will be pleased that you are eating the food he offers, and who knows? Maybe it really is chicken in that soup.\nQuestion: The purpose of the article is to   _  .\n- introduce unfamiliar food\n- share the writer's personal experiences\n- suggest ways to overcome a cultural barrier\n- advise on how to politely refuse to eat foreign food",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article:\nArticle: The greatest recent social changes have been in the lives of women. During the twentieth century there has been a remarkable shortening of the proportion of a woman's life spent in caring for the children. A woman marrying at the end of the nineteenth century would probably have been in her middle twenties, and would be likely to have seven or eight children, four or five of whom lived till they were five years old. By the time the youngest was fifteen, the mother would have been in her early fifties and would expect to live a further twenty years, during which health made it unusual for her to get paid work. Today women marry younger and have fewer children. Usually a woman's youngest child will be fifteen when she is forty-five years and can be expected to live another thirty-five years and is likely to take paid work until retirement at sixty. Even while she has to take care of children, her work is lightened by modern living conditions.\nThis important change in women's life-patterns has only recently begun to have its full effect on women's economic position. Even a few years ago most girls took a full-time job after they left school. However, when they married, they usually left work at once and never returned to it. Today the school- leaving age is sixteen; many girls stay at school after that age, and though women usually marry older, more married women stay at work at least until shortly before their first child is born. Many more afterwards return to full-or-part-time work. Such changes have led to a new relationship in marriage, with the husband accepting a greater share of the duties and satisfactions of family life, and with both husband and wife sharing more equally in providing the money, and running the home, according to the abilities and interests of each of them.",

They are suggesting that the Mona Lisa may be a self- portrait, da Vinci in drag  .\nItaly's National Committee for Cultural Heritage (INCCH) is carrying out the research. They think the artist, who died in 1519, was buried at a French castle and they plan to dig up his body. Using CSI-style technology, they want to rebuild da Vinci's face. Jason Rosenfeld, a member of INCCH, says, \" It shows the reason why we preserved Einstein's brain or King Tut's mummy  , which throws light on the problem we are working on.\"\n\"Now we want to get the body of Leonardo. We want to see what he died of, we want to see his DNA, we want to see the size of his head, and what his facial feature were like, so we can know whether this was a self-portrait.\"\nThe Mona Lisa was painted around 500 years ago. Beyond that, we know almost nothing about the painting that is now on display at the Louvre in Paris.\nBut will the exhumation   discover the truth behind the Mona Lisa? Not likely, according to Rosenfeld. \"If the French government really wants to help find out what this is about, what they should do is allow us to clean the Mona Lisa. We will learn much more from it and understand it better if we are allowed to clean the painting than by digging up a body.\"",

        "Twothirds of the world's major rivers have now been disrupted with more than 50,000 dams in an attempt to  store water and provide power.In the US,there are more than 85,000 dams,disrupting large and small rivers,and in most cases transforming natural flow.The most famous of these,the Hoover Dam,constructed in the 1930s,is mainly responsible for the fact that the Colorado River no longer reaches the ocean.\nDams,besides all their attractive benefits,also have negative impacts.Creating a reservoir means a large area must be flooded.Communities may lose their land,houses and culturally important sites.\nEnvironmentally,the new reservoir can be a paradise for wildlife,especially birds;however,it can cause greenhouse gas emissions and poison the water.Also,the dramatic rise and fall of water levels during dam releases is too extreme for plants and animals to cope with,resulting in dead zones around the shores of reservoirs.Fish that lay their eggs in the shallows,for example,may find a few hours later that those sites are high and dry.\nDownstream of a dam,the flow may be reduced so that farmers cannot irrigate their fields.Many rivers run through national borders,which may cause conflict over precious water.Disputes have been continuing between India and Pakistan,and Turkey,Syria and Iraq,for example.\nDams don't just block the flow of water.They also prevent fish migrations,and dams are a barrier to sediment flows.Instead of rushing downriver,sediments get backed up against the dam wall,which causes the reservoir level to increase over time.However,sediments which are rich in nutrients have become a problem.The fertility of the entire system can be influenced,with soils lost during seasonal rains not being replaced.\nPerhaps the biggest problem can be seen in deltas,which are sinking into the oceans.Groundwater is being extracted to feed the city,causing the city to sink,and sediments washed away by the ocean are no longer being replaced.The result is that sea level rises in cities from Shanghai to Alexandria.\nThe Hoover Dam is mentioned in the passage in order to show  _  .\nA) dams play an important role in our life\nB) dams have impacted the flow of the rivers\nC) dams make people lose their land and houses\nD) dams have many benefits as well as side effects",

They have to show that they will be able to pay for each year of study. Students have to consider not only the tuition, the cost of classes, but also meals and a place to live in, which is known as room-and-board. They also need money for books and supplies. And they need money to spend on social activities and other things.  \nEducational advisers say foreign students should have enough money in a local bank to pay for at least two months of expenditure . So how much will a year at an American school cost? Generally speaking, the answer is: a lot. A leading state university in the Pacific Northwest will serve as an example. The University of Washington says foreign students are paying more than $36,000 this year. This major research university currently has 2,600 foreign students from more than 100 countries. There are many schools that cost less, but also others that cost more. Its web site says the University of Washington does not offer financial assistance to international students. This is generally true of American schools, especially at the undergraduate level.\nThe international application for the university includes a Statement of Financial Responsibility that must be signed. Students must also provide a bank letter or statement from within the past six months. And they have to name someone who will help with payments. These people must send proof from a bank to show that they have the money. Your government or employer may be able to help you pay all or some of the college costs. A good idea is to ask at least eighteen months before you want to start classes in the United States. \nOur Foreign Student Services, including links to web sites discussed in our reports, can be found at www.unsv.com.

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article:\nArticle: Daniel Anderson, a famous psychologist, believes it's important to distinguish television's influences on children from those of the family. We tend to blame TV, he says, for problems it doesn't really cause, overlooking our own roles in shaping children's minds.\nOne traditional belief about television is that it reduces a child's ability to think and to understand the world. While watching TV, children do not merely absorb words and images  . Instead, they learn both explicit and hidden meanings from what they see. Actually, children learn early the psychology of characters in TV shows. Furthermore, as many teachers agree, children understand far more when parents watch TV with them, explaining new words and ideas. Yet, most parents use an educational program as a chance to park their kids in front of the set and do something in another room.\nAnother argument against television is that it replaces reading as a form of entertainment. But according to Anderson, the amount of time spent watching television is not related to reading ability. TV doesn't take the place of reading for most children; it takes the place of similar sorts of recreation, such as listening to the radio and playing sports. Things like parents' educational background have a stronger influence on a child's reading. \"A child's reading ability is best predicted by how much a parent reads.\" Anderson says.\nTraditional wisdom also has it that heavy television-watching lowers IQ   scores and affects school performance. But here, too, Anderson notes that no studies have proved it. In fact, research suggests that it's the other way around. \"If you're smart young, you'll watch less TV when you're older,\" Anderson says. Yet, people of lower IQ tend to be lifelong television viewers.\nFor years researchers have attempted to show that television is dangerous to children. However, by showing that television promotes none of the dangerous effects as conventionally believed, Anderson suggests that television cannot be condemned without considering other influences.",

        "Read the following article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Millions of families around the world have been given a helping hand out of poverty   by micro-credits. These very small loans  , usually less than US$200, have enabled the very poorest people to set up or expand businesses and become self-sufficient.\nThe micro-credit movement started with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, used his own money to set up a bank to benefit the poorest people in Bangladesh--families living on less than US$1 a day. There are now hundreds of organizations around the world following his blueprint to help people escape from poverty.\nSo how does the system work? Local microfinance institutions (MFIs) make contact with families and offer loans, usually to women, to enable them to start or expand a business. These are very poor people who would not normally be able to get credit, but as no collateral   is required they can get micro-credits. They pay back the loan on a weekly basis, over six months to a year.\nA very important aspect to the success of the micro-credit system is that receivers get local support. The MFIs educate local communities about ways to improve their lives, and offer practical support as well as collecting weekly loans payments. They encourage people to help each other, so that the whole community can pull itself out of poverty. MFIs may also help with literacy and health problems.\nMicro-credits are mainly given to women. Experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and will spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. This may be the first chance they've had to contribute financially to the family, and their status in the home and the local community is raised.\nThe micro-credit system is not charity. The payments are fixed-term loans and interest is charged. The costs of making such small loans, collecting them and giving personal support are high. This is shown in the interest rates, which range from 15...\nQuestion: The passage is most probably taken from the   _   section of a magazine.\n- Health\n- Business\n- Finance\n- Education",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: A number of scientific studies have suggested that repeatedly heading a football could increase the risk of developing dementia   in later life.\nIn 2002, former England international footballer Jeff Astle died aged 59. A coroner   said that Astle died from a brain disease likely to have been caused by \"repeated small damages to the brain\" related to heading a heavy leather football.\nDr. Scott Delaney, research director of emergency medicine at McGill University Health Center in Montreal, Canada, has also researched soccer-related head injury and agrees that head-to-head or elbow-to-head blows are the real risk.\nIn 2007, Delaney carried out a study on footballers aged between 12 and 17 that showed they were half as likely to be concussed   wearing headgear   than without.\nHe said youngsters have a higher risk of head injury than adults because their heads are thinner and less able to absorb shock. To make matters worse, their neck muscles aren't as well developed and they often lack the correct heading technique that can help throw away the force of the ball.\nDelaney recommends that children wear headgear when playing football and says his two eldest children wear head protection playing the sport. But he admits that children can be unwilling to be the first to wear head protection--especially when their football heroes play without it.\nWhile headgear can protect footballers from being concussed during a match, no one knows the long-term effects of repeated \"sub-concussive\" blows to the head.\nDelaney says that while there is indirect evidence that a career in soccer can lead to dementia, no one has yet found a sure link between the two. He says proving a link would mean monitoring hundreds of footballers for three or four decades--and that would take a lot of funding.\nQuestion: Children are unwilling to wear headgear because they think   _   .\nOptions: A: headgear is harmful to their heads\nB: headgear influences their skills\nC: they should follow their idols\nD: they mustn't lead the fashion",

        "Article: Play allows children to use their creativity while developing their imagination and physical, cognitive  , and emotional strength. Play is important to healthy brain development. Play allows children to create and explore a world they can master, conquering their fears while practicing adult roles. Undirected play allows children to learn how to work in groups, to share, to negotiate, and to resolve conflicts.\nIdeally, much of play involves adults, but when play is controlled by adults, children acquiesce   to adult rules and concerns and lose some of the benefits play offers them, particularly in developing creativity, leadership, and group skills. In contrast to passive entertainment, play builds active, healthy bodies. In fact, it has been suggested that encouraging unstructured play may be an exceptional way to increase physical activity levels in children, which is one important strategy in the resolution of the obesity problem.\nChildren's development is critically influenced by appropriate, affective relationships with loving and consistent caregivers as they relate to children through play. When parents observe their children in play or join with them in child-driven play, they are given a unique opportunity to see the world from their children's vantage point as the child navigates a world perfectly created just to fit his or her needs. The interactions that occur through play tell children that parents are fully paying attention to them and help to build enduring relationships. Parents who have the opportunity to look at their children's world learn to communicate more effectively with their children and are given another setting to offer guidance. Less verbal children may be able to express their views, giving their parents an opportunity to gain a fuller understanding of their perspective. Quite simply, play offers parents a wonderful opportunity to engage fully with their children.\nPlay is essential to the academic environment. It ensures that the school setting attends to the social and emotional...\nQuestion: Compared with undirected play, play which is controlled by adults   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"doesn't help develop leadership and group skills\"?",

        "When people reunite with their loved ones, it's usually a wildly happy moment. But what is their most common response to seeing them again? It may seem strange, but most of the time they break down in tears.\nNow a group of psychologists from Yale University in the US say they have found the reason why, and that crying tears of joy may well be the body's way of restoring emotional balance.\n\" _ seem to take place when people are unable to tolerate strong positive emotions, and people who do this seem to recover better from those strong emotions,\" Oriana Aragon, the lead researcher, told The Telegraph.\nAragon and her fellow psychologists looked at hundreds of participants' emotional responses to different things, including happy reunions and cute babies.\nMany participants said they would react in a negative or aggressive way to the positive things -- to cry at happy moments and want to pinch a cute baby's face or even tell them \"I want to eat you up!\"\nBut then researchers found that these people were able to calm down from strong emotions more quickly.\n\"We want a happy, middle spot. Extreme is not good. It's hard on our bodies,\" Aragon told The Washington Post.\nThere are many other examples of times when people respond to a positive experience with a negative emotional reaction.\nAt an exciting concert, fans scream in horror at their idols. People who have just had a big lottery win are often in floods of tears.\n\"These findings advance our understanding of how people express and control their emotions, which is importantly related to mental and physical health, the quality of relationship with others, and even how well people work together,\" said Aragon.\nThe psychologists then went further and claimed that the reverse was also true. Strong negative feelings may also bring out positive expressions.\nFor example, people often laugh when they are nervous or they are in a difficult or frightening situation.\nAlso, have you ever seen a character smiling at a time of extreme sadness in a movie?

        "Read the following article and select the best answer.\nArticle: It's almost impossible to go through life without experiencing some kind of failure. If you have a fear of failure, you might be uncomfortable setting goals. But goals help us decide where we want to go in life. Without goals, we have no sure destination.\nMany experts recommend visualization  as a powerful tool for goal setting. Imagining how life will be after you've reached your goal is a great motivator to keep you moving forward. However, visualization might produce the opposite results in people who have a fear of failure. In his article, researcher Thomas Langens showed that people who have a fear of failure were often left in a strong negative mood  after being asked to visualize goals and goal attainment.\nSo, what can you do instead?\nStart by setting a few small goals. These should be goals that are slightly, but not overwhelmingly, challenging. Think of these goals as \"early wins\" that are designed to help improve your confidence. For example, if you've been too afraid to talk to the new department head (who has the power to give you the promotion you want), then make this your first goal: Plan to stop by her office during the next week to introduce yourself. Or, imagine that you've dreamed of returning to school to get your MBA , but you're convinced that you're not smart enough to be accepted into business school. Set a goal to talk with a school counselor or admissions officer to see what's required for admission.\nTry to make your goals tiny steps on the route to much bigger goals. Don't focus on the end picture: getting the promotion, or graduating with an MBA. Just focus on the next step: introducing yourself to the department head, and talking to an admissions officer. That's it.\nTaking one small step at a time will help build your confidence, keep you moving forward, and prevent you from getting overwhelmed with visions of your final goal.\nQuestion: What is the main theme of the passage?\n- Skills to set your goals.\n- Ways to overcome your fear of failure.\n- Having a goal is vital to success.\n- Visualization is a powerful tool for goal setting.",

An American professor discovered the difference while teaching a class in a Brazilian  university. The two-hour class was scheduled to begin at 10 A.M. and end at 12. On the first day , when the professor arrived on time, no one was in the classroom. Many students came after 10:30 A.M. Two students came after 11 A.M. Although all the students greeted the professor as they arrived, few apologized for their lateness.Were these students being rude? He decided to study the students' behavior.\nThe professor talked to American and Brazilian students about lateness in both an informal and a formal situation:at a lunch with a friend and in a university class, respectively.He gave them an example and asked them how they would react, If they had a lunch appointment with a friend,the average American student defined lateness as 19 minutes after the agreed time,On the other hand.the average Brazilian student felt the friend was late after 33 minutes.\nIn an American university, students are expected to arrive at the appointed hour.In contrast, in Brazil,neither the teacher nor the students always arrive at the appointed hour.Classes not only begin at the scheduled time in the United States,but also end at the scheduled time.In the Brazilian class, only a few students left the class at 12:00;many remained past 12:30 to discuss the class and ask more questions.While arriving late may not be very important in Brazil , neither is staying late.\nThe word'punctual'most probably means  _  .\nA) 1eaving soon after class\nB) coming early\nC) arriving a few minutes late\nD) being on time",

The special figure shows a huge social change, with today's children likely to survive far longer than their parents or grandparents. Of the 12.4 million children aged 16 and under, 3.3 million(27%)will become someone who is a hundred years old or more. In a class of 30 children, eight can live to be 100. And the rest of the children are likely to get to an old age, even though they will not make it to three figures.\nExperts warned that children may live to 100, but that they will not get their State pension until they are 70 or beyond. The State pension age is rising to 66 for both men and women by 2020, and the Government has warned it will continue to rise. Laith Khalaf, a pension expert, said, \"Living to an old age is lucky if you can afford it, but a  _ if you can't. Those without enough savings will be depending on the State pension which will be changed.\"\nIt also increases the possibility of millions of people surviving until their 100thbirthday with a poor quality of life because of poor health and little money. Millions of older people have no pensions, no savings and no plans about how they are going to pay for their retirement other than to carry on working. If the older population demands more resources ,then it has to come from their own wealth or the government.\nLaith said, \"Millions of people will be spending over a third of their lives in retirement.

They haven't had a chance to step back and get perspective  , and come back with renewed enthusiasm.\"\nLong working hours without a break, insecurity   about one's job, and other work-related worries can lead to burnout and stress. Humans can usually adapt to pressure, but not for a limitless amount of time.\n\"It is a problem of relating good workers and having them loyal to the firm while they're _ ,\" says David Maume, PhD, professor of sociology at the University of Cincinnati.

It is the language of international business, research, and science. More than three-fourths of the world's mail is written in English.

England started colonies in North America and India in the seventeenth century. By 1900 England also had colonies in other parts of Asia, Africa and the South Pacific. The people in the colonies had to use English. Slowly it became more important than French internationally. After the Second World War, the United States became very powerful, and even more people began to learn English.\nIs English a good international language? It has more words than any other language. The grammar is simpler than in other major languages. However, English spelling is difficult. Foreigners all have trouble spelling English.

Flying around is fun. Eating food that floats is fun.\nI like to play like Superman and see how far I can fly without touching any walls. Another fun thing is to play with water. Most of all, the most exciting thing to do is to look out the window at our beautiful planet Earth below. You never get tired of seeing it like that, the way it really is and it can never be seen that way while standing on its surface.\nWhat's the coolest thing about being on a spacewalk?\nWow! Doing a spacewalk is cool. There is nothing more wonderful than floating in space in your own space suit. It's amazing, and when you are doing a spacewalk, you are \"out there\" just floating in empty space, like the earth, like the moon, like the sun, like the space station. It's not science fiction. It's real.\nQuestion: Why does Greg think doing a spacewalk is the coolest thing?\nOptions: A: He can wear his own space suit then.\nB: He can see the moon when doing that.\nC: He can see the earth by doing so.\nD: He thinks it's great flying in empty space.",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article:\nArticle: Most earthquakes occur within the upper 15 miles of the earth's surface, but earthquakes can and do occur at all depths to about 460 miles. Their number decreases as the depth increases. At about 460 miles one earthquake occurs only every few years. Near the surface earthquakes may run as high as 100 in a month, but the yearly average does not vary much.\nThe extent of the disaster in an earthquake depends on many factors. If you carefully build a toy house with an erect set  , it will still stand no matter how much you shake the table. But if you build a toy house with a pack of cards, a slight shake of the table will make it fall. An earthquake in Agadir was not strong, but it completely destroyed the city. Many stronger earthquakes have done comparatively little damage. If a building is well constructed and built on solid ground, it will resist an earthquake. Most deaths in earthquakes have been due to faulty building construction or poor building sites. A third and very serious factor is panic. When people rush out into narrow streets, more deaths will result.\nThere is one type of earthquake disaster that little can be done about. This is the disaster caused by seismic   sea waves, or tsunamis  . These are often called tidal waves, but the name is incorrect. They had nothing to do with tides. In certain areas, earthquakes take place beneath the sea. These submarine earthquakes sometimes give rise to seismic sea waves. The waves are not noticeable out at sea because of their long wave length. But when they roll into harbors, they pile up into walls of water 6 to 60 feet high. The Japanese call them \"tsunamis\" meaning \"harbor waves\", because they reach a sizable   height only in harbors.\nTsunamis travel fairly slowly, at speeds up to 500 miles an hour. An earthquake warning system is in use to warn all shores likely to be reached by the waves. But this only enables people to leave the threatened shores for higher ground: There is no way to stop the oncoming wave.",

A new study suggests that listening to music in the office improves the speed and accuracy of tasks such as data entry, proofreading and problem solving. In an officebased experiment, 88 per cent of participants were found to produce their most accurate work when listening to music.\nThe study also found that 81 per cent completed their work fastest when music was played. And it matters what type of music you listen to. For instance, if you're doing your tax returns, then classical music is the most effective as it improves maths skills.\nListening to Jessie J or Justin Bieber could also improve your speed, with 58 per cent of participants completing data entry tasks faster while listening to pop songs. During proofreading, dance music, such as David Guetta, had the biggest positive impact with participants increasing their speed by 20 per cent compared to tests undertaken with no music at all. Dance music also had a positive effect on spellchecking with a 75 per cent pass rate compared to 68 per cent when no music was played at all.\nThe research, undertaken by Brightonbased Mindlab International, suggests that silent offices may be the least productive. The Music Works experiment revealed a positive correlation between music and productivity. Overall, it showed that when listening to music, nine out of ten people performed better, said Dr David Lewis, chairman of Mindlab International.\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT mentioned according to the passage?\nOptions: A: Music makes you relaxed.\nB: Music helps you to enter data faster.\nC: Music improves maths skills.\nD: Music has a positive effect on spellchecking.",

Many products are packages and many packages are products,\" as Louis Cheskin, the first social scientist studying consumers' feeling for packaging, noticed.\nColors are one of the best tools in packaging. Studies of eye movement have shown that colors draw human attention quickly. Take V8 for example.

Together with her husband, Pierre, she discovered two new elements and studied the x-rays they emitted. She found that the harmful properties of x-rays were able to kill tumors. By the end of World War I, Marie Curie was probably the most famous woman in the world. She had made a conscious decision, however, not to patent methods of processing radium or its medical applications.\nMarie Curie was born on November 7, 1867 in Poland and died on July 4, 1934. Her co-discovery with her husband Pierre Curie of the radioactive elements radium and polonium represents one of the best known stories in modern science for which they were recognized in 1901 with the Nobel Prize for Physics. In 1911, Marie Curie was honored with a second Nobel prize, this time for chemistry, to honor her for successfully isolating pure radium and determining radium's atomic weight.\nAs a child, Marie Curie amazed people with her great memory. She learned to read when she was only four years old. Her father was a professor of science and the instruments that he kept in a glass case fascinated Marie. She dreamed of becoming a scientist, but that would not be easy. Her family became very poor, and at the age of 18, Marie became a governess. She helped pay for her sister to study in Paris. Later, her sister helped Marie with her education. In 1891, Marie attended the Sorbonne University in Paris where she met and married Pierre Curie, a well-known physicist.\nMarie Curie contributed greatly to our understanding of radioactivity and the effects of x-rays. She received two Nobel prizes for her brilliant work, but died of leukemia, caused by her repeated exposure to radioactive material.\nQuestion: What does the passage mainly talked about?\n- Marie Curie discovered radium\n- Marie Curie, a famous chemist\n- Marie Curie won two Noble Prizes\n- The brief biography of Marie Curie",

This heart-stopping scene happened yesterday at Ashburton station in Melbourne, Australia. But the story has a happy ending: the six-month-old baby survived with just a cut on his forehead, although the pram was dragged about 35 metres by the braking train. The nurse Jon Wright said the boy just \"needed a feed and a sleep\" and didn't need to stay in hospital.\n\"Luckily, he was strapped   into his pram at the time, which probably saved his life. I think the child is extremely lucky, \" Wright told theHerald Sunnewspaper after the baby was taken to hospital with minor injuries.\nFortunately the train was already slowing down to stop at the station so it stopped quickly when the driver put on the brakes as soon as he saw the pram fall in front of him. Rail firm Connex is to look into how the pram rolled off the platform. The accident came one day after Connex started a child safety awareness activity warning parents to keep babies strapped into their prams at all times while on platforms.\nThe accident happened at the same time as the \"balloon boy \"story in the US, in which a six-year-old Colorado boy was reported to be trapped in a flyaway balloon. However, he was later found hiding in the family's garage. Many people believe that it had all been a publicity _ by the parents.

Everything I saw and did amazed me. I have journal entries that are pages long describing, in great detail, everything I ate. From the sauce to the kind of chopsticks  I used, nothing went unnoticed or unrecorded. Chinese people gape at me when they see me using chopsticks, just because I can.\nWestern eating is so different, not only in the use of cutlery , but also in the rules of eating, for which there are many. For example, everything is cut before it's eaten, except salad. Instead of eating around the bone, as we do here (I do it too, of course), people cut around the bones, which makes eating fish a difficult thing. Also, there is a certain way to eat soup, which involves pushing the spoon away from you, to make sure you don't get splashed, and never slurping or touching your teeth on the spoon. Before I came here, I thought table manners were very important. Now I think that they are silly, worrying and concentrating on changing the fork and knife every time you cut your food takes away from the enjoyment of food.\nEvery time I eat at a restaurant, I try something new. I am not afraid of trying anything and I will eat anything once. At first I would try a bite and not like it. This happened with fish heads, snake, anything spicy, and bitter melon, to name a few. Now I like all of these things.\nMy new favorite dish is spicy fish heads. There are vegetables whose names I don't know in English. I am proficient in Chinese food, and am also at least ten pounds heavier than when I first arrived. I never even like rice before I came here, and now I have it with every meal. I don't like cheese either, and Western food just doesn't taste as good as it once did. Even McDonald's is better here.\nQuestion: According to western rules of eating, which of the following is NOT cut before it is eaten?\nOptions: A: Bread.\nB: Meat.\nC: Salad.\nD: Fish.",

They were holding hands and had lovely smiles on their faces. They sat three tables from me. I was amazed at the love they showed for each other. It seemed to strike home all the more, because it was shortly after ending a 20-year marriage and I still had pain in my heart.\nMy waiter was also their waiter. As I paid my bill, I inquired as to what their bill was. He informed me, and I gave him $40 to pay their bill.

After I had been seated, the waiter who served me the night before told me that the strangest thing happened after I left the restaurant.\nWhen the elderly couple went to pay for their meal, they were informed that it had been paid. When they inquired who had done this, the hostess told them they had no idea who I was, just retelling what I said.\nThe couple were amazed.

I waited and waited and finally walked over to the hostess stand and explained that I needed to pay for my meal and hurry to the airport. She smiled and explained that I would not have to pay for my meal, because both the waiter and she felt compelled to pay my bill due to the joy that was brought to the faces of the elderly couple and the amazement of the young couples.\nWhen I told her that they didn't have to do that, she said with a smile \"Love begets Love.\"\nWhat can be inferred from the story?\nA) The love between the elderly couple deeply touched the writer who was single.\nB) The young couples paid the bill of other customers in the restaurant.\nC) The waiter left on purpose and made the writer stay alone to test him.\nD) The writer did all this to prove his belief in love.",

All of these involve just a few changes to our daily habits.\nJust walk and limit the use of your car. One of the poster images of pollution is our vehicles. It burns fuel. It is not as efficient as we hope it could be, and we use it every single day. To lessen the effects of the air pollution caused by our vehicles, we should limit their use. If we can walk to our destination then just let us go. Not only do we lessen our carbon dioxide emissions, but we also get a good exercise out of it.\nUse a laptop instead of a computer desktop. Laptops are more energy efficient compared to their bigger counterparts. A laptop is generally 50 percent more efficient in using electricity. Aside from that there are other benefits of a laptop. It is portable so you can work anywhere you like and that you get powerful features without the large size of desktop units.\nTurn off the faucet while you are brushing your teeth. It is always a better idea to use a glass when we are brushing our teeth and not to just let the faucet keep on running. Therefore,there is less water to waste while we are cleaning our pearly whites. Simply turn off the faucet when you are not using it.\nMake good use of natural light. We have a great and natural lamp --- the sun, and we should learn how to take full advantage of it during daytime. So instead of turning on our lights or lamps even if it is still not evening, we should pull up the drapes and let the natural light come in from the windows.\nThese are just some of the best tips for green living, but of course there are still many of these tips if you just search for them. But you can do your own variation any time just always prioritize how you can use less energy and produce even lesser trash and pollution.",

It is a small, wild bird, and it lives only on the island of Little Mangere, off the coast of New Zealand. In 1967 there were about fifty black robins; in 1977 there were fewer than ten. These are the only black robins left in the world. The island has many other birds, of different kinds, large and small; these seem to multiply very happily.\nEnergetic steps are being taken to preserve the black robin. Detailed studies are going on, and a public appeal for money has been made. The idea is to buy another island nearby as a special home, a \"reserve\", for threatened wild life, including black robins. The organizers say that Little Mangere should then be supplied with the robin's food--it eats only one kind of seed. Thousands of the required plants are at present being cultivated in New Zealand. The public appeal is aimed at the conscience of mankind, so that the wild black robin will not die out and disappear form the earth in our time at least.\nIs all this concern a waste of human effort? Is it any business of ours whether the black robin survives or dies out? Are we losing our sense of what is reasonable and what is unreasonable?\nIn the earth's long, long past, hundreds of kinds of creatures have evolved, risen to a degree of success--and died out. In the long, long future, there will be many new and different forms of life. Those creatures that adapt themselves successfully to what the earth offers will survive for a long time. Those that fail to meet the challenges will disappear early. This is nature's proven method of operation.\nThe rule of selection--\"the survival of the fittest\"--is the one by which human beings have themselves arrived on the scene. We, being one of the most adaptable creatures the earth has yet produced, may last longer than most. You may take it as another rule that when, at last, human beings show signs of dying out, no other creature will extend a paw to put off our departure. On the contrary, we will be hurried out. For nature,...\nQuestion: The black robin is dying out mainly because  _  .\n- people have been very careless about its survival\n- the appeal for money has come at the wrong time\n- the other birds on the island have destroyed it\n- its only food supply is far from enough on Little Mangere",

Piloting the plane was Captain Thomas Nash. Looking westward, Nash saw twelve orange lights in a row, moving at a very high rate of speed. Thinking they might be a new German weapon, he swung the plane around and headed directly for the lights, but they disappeared.\nCaptain Nash may have been the first to see such orange lights but he wasn't the last. His experience was repeated many times by pilots during World War II both in England and Far East.\nWhat were they? No one knows for sure, but there is an interesting theory to explain them. According to this theory, the orange lights are space animals---animals specially adapted   to life in the upper atmosphere just as some living things are adapted to life at the bottom of the sea.\nThese space animals, the theory says, live so far up in the atmosphere that they are not in sight from the earth. They feed partly on the air and partly on energy from the sunlight. Being almost pure energy themselves, their body shine at night. During the day, however, they are invisible.\nBefore World War II, continues the theory, there was little radiated energy on the earth's surface. Then came the development of rockets, nuclear power stations and something like that. The space animals are attracted to these kinds of energy of food. At night when there is no energy from the sunlight, they come down into the lower levels in search of a meal. They may even float into the range of human eyesight. This explains the fact that they have been sighted many times from the earth since 1943.\nQuestion: The space animal theory would seem to suggest that   _  .\nAnswer:",

The odd thing is, no one has turned on a flashlight, and no streetlights or house lights wink  on around them.\nThese people have traveled to the countryside more than an hour from Washington, D. C., to get away from the glow of city lights.  That's because they are attending a star party. Star parties are gatherings where professional and amateur astronomers set up their telescopes and invite people to come learn about the night sky. Getting away from light pollution, or artificial skylight from buildings for example,  helps stargazers   see objects in the sky much better.\nAt this star party, Sean O'Brien of the National Air and Space Museum's Einstein Planetarium starts off by asking the crowd to simply look up and take in all they can see. He points out plenty of things that can be seen without special equipment. Stars, satellites, and even the Andromeda galaxy  can be found if you know where to look.\nAfter that, several dozen astronomers offer close-up views. Each has focused their telescope on a different part of the sky. As kids take a look, the owner gives a mini-lesson.\nO'Brien says you can have your own star party at home and learn a lot just by paying attention to what's happening up above. \"Watch the sky as the seasons pass, and you will see that it changes,\" he says. \"Or start with the moon. Notice when and where you are seeing it--maybe even in the early morning while you wait for the school bus. \"\nQuestion: From the passage, we can infer that if you want to see the objects in the sky_.\n- you'd better escape from pollution and sunlight\n- you'd better follow Sean O'Brien's guidance\n- you'd better buy some advanced equipment\n- you'd better make use of your imagination",

There was a big revival  at my Auntie Reed's church. Then just before the revival ended, they held a special meeting for children, \"to bring the young lambs to the fold \". My aunt spoke of it for days ahead. That night I was accompanied to the front row and placed on the mourners' bench with all the other young sinners, who had not yet been brought to Jesus.\nMy aunt told me that when you were saved you saw a light, and something happened to you inside! And Jesus came into your life! And God was with you from then on! She said you could see and hear and feel Jesus in your soul. I believed her.\nSo I sat there calmly in the hot, crowded church, waiting for Jesus to come to me. I wanted to see him, but nothing happened to me. Nothing! I wanted something to happen to me, but nothing happened.\nNow it was really getting late. So I decided that maybe to save further trouble, I'd better lie and say that Jesus had come, and get up and be saved. So I get up. The whole room broke into a sea of shouting and my aunt threw her arms around me. The minister took me by the hand and led me to the platform.\nThat night I cried. I cried, in bed alone, and couldn't stop. My aunt woke up and told my uncle I was crying because the Holy Ghost had come into my life, and because I had seen Jesus. But I was really crying because I couldn't bear to tell her that I had lied, that I had deceived everyone in the church, that I hadn't seen Jesus, and that now I didn't believe there was a Jesus any more, since he didn't come to help me.\nQuestion: What does the passage mainly tell us?\nOptions: A: The child was finally saved from sin\nB: The child did not think much of being saved from sin\nC: Everyone else was delighted at the child's being saved from sin\nD: The child got through a painful process and was finally saved from sin but felt unhappy",

(KABC)A Santa Monica High School teacher who was put on\nleave after using physical force to control a student who was selling marijuana in his classroom has received surprising support on Facebook. The incident was captured on video and has caused a sudden reaction from parents, teachers, students and even graduates. They are showing their support for Black. A Facebook page supporting \"Coach Black\" has over 4,700 likes. And many want him back in the classroom.\nStudent witnesses say Mark Black, who is also the wrestling coach, tried to confiscate a bag of marijuana and was then injured by the student with a pencil. The cellphone video shows Black locking the student's legs and pinning the student to the ground. \"He just wanted him to stop and he was trying to be a teacher and help, and I don't think it was his fault.\" said student Kylan Townsend.\nSchool Board member Oscar De La Tone says Mr. Black is one of his teachers at Santa Monica High School. \"I know him very well. I know him to be a fair person, a good person, someone who cares deeply about his students,\" said De La Torre. He says that the video does not tell the whole story and that the incident brings to light the issue of drug use, something the district needs to address.\nBut in an email to parents, Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District Superintendent Sandra Lyon says the teacher's behavior is \"absolutely alarming.\" She put Black on leave during an independent investigation.\nLyon has come under fire from parents for initially saying the kind of physical action used by the teacher was unacceptable. On Saturday, Lyon released the following statement to Eyewitness News: \"I want to stress that teachers are at times confronted with difficult, even threatening situations, and they must make judgment calls to protect safety. I want to emphasize that putting the teacher who was involved in this incident on leave until completion of an independent investigation is a matter of standard policy and practice; it in no way prejudices the...\nQuestion: Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?\n- Teacher Put on Leave Receives Support\n- Thousands Come and Sign the Petition\n- School Teacher Wrestled with Student\n- Cellphone Video on the Facebook Page",

Physical details alone tell us about health, diet and the type of work a person does. A hundred years ago the working class often looked unhealthy, small and they were either too thin or too fat. The upper classes were often tall, sporting types who were used to a good diet and looked healthy. Today living and working conditions have improved, and such descriptions are no longer true. People are taller now than a hundred years ago. Everyone in Britain today is able to have free medicine, a good diet, acceptable working conditions and enough rest and leisure. WWW.K**S*858$$U.COM\nThe clothes people choose to wear, however, do provide information about their backgrounds. Expensive clothes look expensive and show their wearer is rich. Clothes can provide other clues as well. The upper classes appear to be less interested in fashion and wear good quality clothes in non-bright colours, made of natural material like wool, leather and cotton. Lower working-class people often choose clothes in bright colours, made of man-made materials. A sociological explanation for this would be that colour and interest are missing from their lives, and therefore any opportunity to produce this is taken.\nClothes are available at a price within most people's reach. New clothes make the wearer feel good and show some degree of wealth to the outside world. Today it is the younger people who spend most money on clothes. Fashion is no longer for the upper classes and the rich. Young people from all social classes spend a lot of money on clothes.

        "If you were to come up with a list of organizations whose failures had done the most damage to the American economy in recent years,you would probably have to start with the Wall Street firms that brought us the financial.From there,you might move on to the automakers in Detroit.\n    But I would suggest that the list should also include a less obvious nominee:public education.\n    At its top level,the American system of higher education may be the best in the world.Yet in terms of its core mission-turning teenagers into educated college graduates--much of the system is failing.\n    The United States does a good job enrolling teenagers in college,but only half of the students who enroll end up with a bachelor's degree.\nSo identifying the causes of the college dropout crisis m the world's largest economy matters enormously, and a new book called Crossing the Finish Line tries to do precisely that.Its authors are economists William Bowen and Michael.McPherson,and a doctoral candidate Matthew Chigoes.The first problem they diagnose is something they call tender-matching. It refers to students who choose not to attend the best college they can get into.They instead go to a less selective one,perhaps one that is closer to home or less expensive.About half of the low--income students with a grade-point average of at least3.5 in high school and an SAT score of at least 1,200 do not attend the best college they could have.  \"I was really astonished by the degree to which well--qualified students from poor families under-matched,\" said Mr.Bowen.\nIn fact,well-off students attend the colleges that do the best job of producing graduates.Meanwhile,lower-income students-even when they are better qualified--often go to colleges that excel in producing drop-outs.\"It's really a waste,\"Mr.Bowen said,\"and a big problem for the country.\"As the authors point out, the only way to lift the college graduation rate significantly is to lift it among poor and working--class students. Instead,it appears to have fallen. \n   What can be...\nThe title of the Book Crossing the Finish Line probably means  _  .\nA) running to the end of the line\nB) going to college\nC) finishing college education\nD) working hard in college",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\nArticle: It is widely known that any English conversation begins with The Weather. Such a fixation with the weather finds expression in Dr. Johnson's famous comment that \"When two English meet, their first talk is of weather.\" Though Johnson's observation is as accurate now as it was over two hundred years ago, most commentators fail to come up with a convincing explanation for this English weather-speak.\nBill Bryson, for example, concludes that, as the English weather is not at all exciting, the _ with it can hardly be understood. He argues that \"To an outsider, the most striking thing about the English weather is that there is not very much of it.\" Simply, the reason is that the unusual and unpredictable weather is almost unknown in the British Isles.\nJeremy Paxman, however, disagrees with Bryson, arguing that the English weather is by nature attractive. Bryson is wrong, he says, because the English preference for the weather has nothing to do with the natural phenomena. \"The interest is less in the phenomena themselves, but in uncertainty.\" According to him, the weather in England is very changeable and uncertain and it attracts the English as well as the outsider.\nBryson and Paxman stand for common misconceptions about the weather-speak among the English. Both commentators, somehow, are missing the point. The English weather conversation is not really about the weather at all. English weather-speak is a system of signs, which is developed to help the speakers overcome the natural reserve and actually talk to each other. Everyone knows conversations starting with weather-speak are not requests for weather data. Rather, they are routine greetings, conversation starters or the blank \"fillers\". In other words, English weather-speak is a means of social bonding.\nOptions:\nA To explain what English weather-speak is about.\nB To analyse misconceptions about the English weather.\nC To find fault with both Bill Bryson and Jeremy Paxman.\nD To convince people that the English weather is changeable.\nAnswer:\nA To explain what English weather-speak is about.\nQuestion:",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: When you visit America, you will see the word Motel on signs and notice boards. It is made up of \"motor\" and \"hotel\" and it is really a hotel for people who arrive by car (how-ever, you don't need a car to stay at one). You have to pay when you arrive for your room, which usually has a bath. Meals are not provided, but there will certainly be a cafeteria  . Americans eat a lot of salads and sandwiches. Along the main roads there are a lot of motels. Each tries to offer more than next. Some provide television in every bedroom; others have swimming pools; and so on. Motels are especially useful when you are in the country, far from a town or city. You will also find them in the big National Parks.\nIn these great National Parks, you may meet guests you don't expect to see. An American friend told me a little story. In the middle of a moonless night she heard strange noises outside her motel window in the Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. Thinking it might be a thief, she jumped out of bed, opened the door and _ towards a dark shadow . As she got close, she saw the thief. She was dreadfully frightened: it wasn't a human thief -- it was a big black bear. The bear was turning over some empty tins with its paw, looking for tasty bits of food. My friend decided to leave that particular thief alone!\nThere are also, of course, places called \"rooming houses\",  where they receive lodgers  . You will see such signs as Tourists or Rooms Rent, and you could try one of these. A word of warning -- looking for a room in New York during the tourist season is like looking for gold on the moon!\nQuestion: Which of the following is TRUE about motels?\nOptions: A: You can only find motels in the big National Parks.\nB: They are free for people who arrive by car.\nC: If you want to stay at a motel, you must have a car.\nD: The word \"motel\" is formed by two words.",

        "Article: Plenty of people dream of traveling to other planets. But \"Star Wars\" fans can actually visit locations where many of the films' most famous scenes were shot. Here are some of the places where \"Star Wars\" comes to life.\nHotel Sidi Driss, Matmata, Tunisia\nPerhaps the most famous \"Star Wars\" landmark in the world, this is where the interiors of Luke Skywalker's childhood home on planet Tatooine were filmed. Centuries ago, Berbers built the underground structure as a real home. Eventually it became a hotel, which George Lucas used to film the first \"Star Wars\" film. The set decorations came down when the crew left, but were rebuilt in 2000 for \"Attack of the Clones.\" Since then, they've remained, so guests can eat at the table where young master Luke did.\nLa Grande Dune, outside Nefta, Tunisia\nThe igloo  outside of Luke's house was filmed about 300 kilometers away on the dried-up salt lake of Chott El Jerid. The igloo is still there, reachable with a decent car at the GPS coordinates 33\"50'34. 42\"N, 7\"46'44.48\"E.\nThe surrounding hotels are man-made, to create the illusion  that the underground house is next to it. The igloo from the 1977 movie was taken apart, but again rebuilt for \"Attack of the Clones,\" and later restored by a fan. Nearby is La Grande Dune, site of the Dune Sea. About 30 minutes from the igloo is the set of Mos Espa, the spaceport town where Anakin was discovered as a young slave.\nRedwood National and State parks, California\n _ , the forest moon home of the furry Ewoks, was filmed among California's giant redwoods. Most of the well-known scenes were shot on private land owned by a lumber company. Since the cast and crew worked on \"Return of the Jedi\" in 1982, heavy logging has left most of the landscape unrecognizable. But driving through the parks still gives a feel for the set, especially along the Avenue of the Giants highway.\nIn Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park and the Humboldt Redwoods State Park, plates were filmed for some chase scenes.\nQuestion: Hotel Sidi Driss was originally   _   centuries ago.\nYes or no, is the answer \"Berbers' real home\"?",

A major football event will happen in the South American country later this month, but with teams of robots playing the game, which is known as soccer in the United States. The robot teams are guided by teams of humans from around the world. The event is known as RoboCup.\nTechnology students at the University of Pennsylvania are trying for their fourth victory at the competition, which is held this year in the coastal city Joao Pessoa. The students have won the last three RoboCup competitions.\nWatching robots play football is similar to watching children play the game. The kicks are not good, there's a lot of falling down, and people are there to guide and support the team members. Jian Qiao Li is one of the leaders of the University of Pennsylvania team.\nHe says one goal he has for the robot team is to make sure the machines can find the goal and the ball. He also wants the robots to be able to know where they are on the playing field. And he wants the team to be able to better control the walking and kicking abilities of the robots.\nQin He is another leader of the robot team. She says the abilities of the robots increase every year. Ms. He says the US team is meeting its goals. The robots know the differences between the colors green and red, and they can decide where to go and where the ball is on the playing field. She says if there are three robot players on the field at the same time, they will communicate with each other to decide the different responsibilities for each robot.\nU. S. Team member Christopher Akatusuka hopes for another victory in Brazil. The team has won the RoboCup the past three years in the Netherlands, Mexico and Turkey.\n\"They have every good team player right now. As long as their detection is good, I think they'll be very competitive; we just hope to compete against the real good German teams eventually, because the Germans always do very well, \" says Akatsuka.\nMr Akatsuka says RoboCup...\nQuestion: The robots' performance of playing the game is   _   .\nAnswer:",

        "Article: Werewolves   aren't the only creatures  affected by the moon's cycles. A full moon slightly affects people's sleep, reports a Swiss team of scientists. Even people's sleep in a lab without windows experienced a small shortfall in sleep once a month.\nTo test the moon's effect, 33 adult volunteers of both sexes and various ages spent several nights in a sleep lab. As they slept, researchers recorded their brain activity, eye movements and hormone   levels. On nights closer to a full moon, the subjects took an average of five minutes longer to fall asleep, and slept for 20 minutes less. In addition, brain activity decreased by 30 percent during the sleep stage that the brain normally uses to recover from its daylight work. And levels of hormone that help control sleep cycles dropped. On these nights, the sleepers complained of poor sleep quality even though they were unaware of the moon's cycle. On the bright side, not a single participant turned into a werewolf.\nThe Swiss team doesn't know how the moon affects sleep. The gravity   of the moon causes ocean tides to rise and fall. But that force is too weak to affect sleep, Gajochen says. He believed some body's biological clock may be tied to the moon cycles. There may be another explanation, says David Dinges. This sleep researcher at the University Of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia says that the body clock is very sensitive to light at night. Volunteer's sleep could have been affected by exposure to extra moonlight before arriving at the lab.\nQuestion: What happened to the volunteers during the experiment on a full moon?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Their brains were not so active as they were\"?",

Currently, it's common for online shoppers to order two or three different sizes of the same item of clothing at the same time, as they're unsure which one will fit best.\"",

These new phones are so powerful that having one is almost like having a whole library in your pocket. It's an instant   source of information that helps young people get the latest news.

My grandfather, it seems, had a habit of keeping his loose change in his shirt pocket. As they prayed side by side, during one of the prostrations  , the coins fell down onto the carpet.\nMy grandfather did not notice it. However, a man seated nearby as well as my father noticed the incident. The man reacted fast and picked up the coins and went off into another corner of the mosque.\nMy father took everything in and as soon as my grandfather finished praying, he told him what had happened. My grandfather having heard just about what happened stopped my dad from telling him who took the money.\nThen he went on to tell my dad the following. \"If the man has chosen to steal in the mosque, then it must be because his life is too bad. We must not be quick to judge such people,\" he said.\nSince they owned a grocery shop, my father was told by his father to make sure that every month he should make up a parcel of all the daily necessities required in a household and send it to that person without telling him who sent it.\nWouldn't this world be a better place to live in if we had such wisdom spreading within our society!\nQuestion: We can learn from the passage that   _  .\nOptions: A: the author was stopped by his father from telling the truth\nB: nobody but the man saw the coins in the mosque\nC: the man was thankful to the author's father for helping him\nD: the man who hid the coins was probably living a hard life",

Professor Worm says species have recently been disappearing from oceans at increasing speed. At this rate, he says, all seafood species could collapse by 2048 and seafood supplies from the world's ocean could be almost gone by then.\nOther studies have also warned about the dangers of overfishing and the effects on ocean environments. But not everyone thinks the oceans are likely to be empty in fifty years. Some scientists said parts of the world do have problems, but others are doing a good job of protecting fish populations. Government officials in several countries with large fishing industries also questioned the research.\nThe study appeared earlier this month in Science magazine.\nThe researchers say damage to oceans affects not only fish populations but also the productivity of ecosystems. These complex systems help control water quality. The scientists say the loss of different kinds of sea life appeared to increase the risk of fish kills and beach closures from harmful algae growth.\nThe scientists examined the results of thirty-two experiments and observed forty-eight protected areas. They also looked at records of catches worldwide. They studied records from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization for nineteen fifty to two thousand three. And they examined archeological information and other historical records for twelve coastal areas. That research reached back over a thousand years.\nBoris Worm says the findings were, in his words, \"beyond anything we suspected.\" But he also said the situation is not too late to correct. He said that with good fisheries management, some species could completely recover in three to ten years.\nQuestion: Which of the following isn't the damage to the ocean?\nOptions: A: The species of fish in the ocean are reducing.\nB: Sea water is polluted.\nC: Sea water quality is improved.\nD: Less productivity of ecosystem.",

        "Article: Agricultural experts met in Ethiopia last week to discuss ways to help sub-Saharan Africa become a major producer of wheat. The area traditionally produced little wheat, while North Africa was the grain basket.\nWheat production fell sharply in sub-Saharan countries during the 1980s. In the 1960s, attempts were made to grow wheat in sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa and Zimbabwe. But those countries found it was less costly to import wheat from Europe and the United States. Another problem is that Africa's wheat farms were often far from population centers. There also were transportation issues. And some lowlands were not a good place to grow wheat.\nHans Joachim Braun,one of the experts, says now is a good time to increase wheat production. In the last four years we have seen three major price hikes, where the wheat price and other staple process  exploded. And that puts a big, big bill on countries which are depending on wheat imports, and Africa is the biggest wheat importer.\nHe also says demand for wheat in sub-Saharan Africa is growing faster than for any other crop. With higher income people would like to have more diversified food. But that is possible not the most important one. The most important one is that there is a tremendous migration of in particular male labor to the cities. And wheat products are convenient food because you can easily buy it. It's easy to process and you also can store it for a few days, which is different from some of the maize and rice products.\nThere are three possible challenges for growing more wheat in Africa: climate change, disease and pests, like insects. Mr. Braun says rising temperatures should not have a major effect on wheat. In fact, he says, it could help wheat grow in areas with high rainfall totals. As for fighting disease and pests, experts suggest growing more resistant crops. In addition, railroads and roads would have to be improved so large amounts of wheat could be moved to large markets.\nQuestion: Why is there a higher demand for wheat in sub-Saharan Africa?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Because male labor are crowding into the cities.\"?",

This job was that they should be good mothers bringing up children at home while their husbands worked. Except for some special fields, Hitler saw no reason why a woman should work. Within months of Hitler coming to power, many female doctors, teachers and lawyers were\n. By the start of the Second World War, very few German women were in fulltime work. From their earliest years, girls were taught that all good German women married at a young age to a proper German and that the wife's job was to keep a good home for her working husband and to have children.\nOne of the earliest laws passed by Hitler once he came to power in 1933, was the Law for the Encouragement of Marriage. This law stated   that all newly married couples would get a government loan   of 1000 marks. This loan was not to be simply paid back. The birth of one child meant that 25% of the loan did not have to be paid back. Two children meant that 50% of the loan didn't need to be paid back. Four children meant that the entire loan was cleared.\nWhat was more, as housewives and mothers, their lives were controlled. Women were not expected to wear make-up or trousers. Only flat shoes were expected to be worn. Women were discouraged from slimming as this was considered bad for child birth.\nThe aim of the Law for the Encouragement of Marriage was to    _   .\nA) attract more young people to join the army willingly\nB) make those married couples become rich quickly\nC) encourage people to loan more from the government\nD) encourage couples to have as many children as they could",

All that is required is a bit of imagination and some time set aside for fun. And the best part is that these are the kind of memories a child will remember for a lifetime.\nFamily game night\nFind out any of the games that are already around the house. Kids often get computer games for Christmas or birthdays, and would love to have a chance to play with their family. Or, make up some games of your own. \" _ \" is a fun game to play that will challenge a child to use his/her imagination. Divide the family into teams and let each team come up with words that the other has to act out.\n _ \nPick some time for the family to sit down and come up with their own masterpiece. It doesn't need to be just a drawing -- take some old magazines sitting around the house, let the kids cut out pictures and paste them into their own montage. Or, use items from nature. Let them use leaves, pine cones, twigs and whatever else they can find to create something from their imaginations.\nFamily Picnic\nTaking the family for a picnic is a great way for some fun that doesn't cost any money. If the weather is nice, take them to a park or playground and let the kids have a day of playing. Or, if it is the middle of winter and a foot of snow is on the ground, set up a picnic in the living room.\nFamily Field Trip\nA family field trip doesn't have to cost a dime. Ask a nearby farm if it would be alright to bring your kids out for a tour and to see some of the animals. Or take them to a park and make a scavenger hunt where they need to find certain items from nature. Ask a local business if you could bring the family for a tour to see how things work -- you might be surprised at the number of people who would be thrilled to share what they do with others, and it could be an interesting lesson for the kids.\nQuestion: We can learn from the passage that \"charades\"   _  .\nAnswer:",

Then from across the street someone came walking.\nIt looked like a man of middle height, dressed in a big raincoat, a soft hat and rubber-soled boots or shoes, and making little sound while walking. No one was in sight. It was a street with two rows of about fifty small houses and there were three lamps on either side. The lamp nearest to the child's house could be seen clearly, but the others were almost hidden by the smoky air. A car passed the end of the street and its lights showed faintly,but clearly enough to show the smooth skin of a woman's face. The car disappeared as the woman, wrapped up in her coat, reached the doorway of the child's house. She put a key in the lock quickly, pushed the door open and stepped inside, then closed the door without looking round. She began to breathe hard.\nShe leaned against the door for a moment, then straightened up as if with an effort, and walked towards the door of the front room, the passage leading to the kitchen, and the narrow staircase. She hesitated outside the door, then went up the stairs quickly but with hardly a sound. There was enough light from the narrow hall to show the four doors leading off a small landing . She pushed each door open in turn and shone a torch inside, and the light fell upon beds, walls, furniture, a bathroom hand-basin, a mirror which flashed brightness back; but this was not what the woman was looking for. She turned away and went downstairs, and hesitated again at the foot of the stairs, then turned towards the kitchen. Clearly there was nothing there, or in the small washroom that she wanted. Two rooms remained; the front room and a smaller one next to it. She opened the front room door. After a moment, she saw the child's bed and the child.\nQuestion: Once she was in the house, the woman behaved as if what she was looking for   _\nOptions: A: might be in the kitchen\nB: was more likely to be upstairs\nC: would be easily seen by the light from the hall\nD: would look frightening to a child",

        "Article: When I was growing up in the suburbs of New York, our first local Earth Day was organized around a drive to a town field where families were urged to empty items from their basements  for recycling rather than dropping them in the dustbin. It was an eye opening idea for a kid in 1970.\nBut as an environmental reporter, I'm bored of the large amount of deals and promotions that arrive by email or in my office or home mailbox on Earth Day. Like Valentine's Day, Earth Day has become a huge marketing opportunity--a way to promote consumption.\nIn fact, Earth Day is such a good sales opportunity that some shops, like Target, have expanded Earth Day into Earth Month.\nThere isn't time to give you a variety of the Earth Day shopping opportunities I was informed of this past week. They included deals on buying bottled water and earth-friendly wipes.\nMy award for the silliest promotion: a plan to gift 25 of the most environmentally conscious stars with unique, useful and \"green\" products and services, including skin care products, cheese-cake and artwork. My guess is most of the stuff will end up in celebrities' garbage.\nIs buying and selling a good way to celebrate and protect the environment? I would argue that Earth Day might be an occasion to consider giving up purchases or habits that are environmentally questionable or that we could happily do without. How about not buying bottled water, but refilling a water bottle? How about not buying foods--even \"organic\" foods--that are packed in non-recyclable plastic?\nDon't get me wrong. The company of Bridgestone is celebrating Earth Day by promising to repurpose a spent tire for every tire that it sells. Verizon will plant a tree for each cell phone you trade in. Some coffee stores will even refill reusable cups at no charge. Target is giving out free reusable carrier bags without requiring a purchase.\nBut few shopkeepers are taking the next step-charging a fee at the cash register for disposable plastic bags, a common practice in Europe-to encourage customers to use those...\nQuestion: It could be inferred from the text that Bridgestone and Verizon  _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"have a good way to celebrate Earth Day\"?",

I take on too many projects at once, and spend too much of my time doing things I'd rather not be doing. I get stuff done, but it's not always the best I can do, or the best way I could spend my time.\nThat's why my newest goal, both as a professional and a person, is to be a quitter.\nBeing a quitter isn't being someone who gives up, who doesn't see important things through to the end. I desire to be the opposite of that. The quitter I want to be is someone who gets out when there's no value in what he's doing, or when that value comes at the expense of something more important.\nWe get involved in something, realize we don't want to be a part of it, but keep on going. We say \"Well, I've already invested so much time in this, I might as well stick it out.\" A friend of mine once told me, \"I knew I was an adult when I could stop reading a book, even after getting 500 pages into it.\" Odd though it sounds, we all tend to do this.\nI propose the opposite: quit as often as possible, regardless of project status or time invested. If you're reading a book, and don't like it, stop reading. Cut your losses, realize that the smartest thing to do is stop before your losses grow even more, and quit. Instead of reading an entire book you hate, read half of a bad one and half of a good one. Isn't that a better use of your time?\nStep back for a second. Let's learn how to say \"no\" at the beginning, or in the middle, and free up more of our time to do the things we'd like to be doing, and the things actually worth doing.\nSaying no is hard, and admitting a mistaken yes is even harder. But if we do both, we'll start to make sure that we're spending our time creating value, rather than increasing our losses. Let's be quitters together.\nQuestion: The author wants to be a quitter, because he/she  _  .\nAnswer:",

But Xing Pu, a 40-year-old economist, is asking the government to give red packets to every Chinese citizen.\nXing suggested the government give out 1,000 Yuan to each Chinese since the government income has increased rapidly in recent years. He said his suggestion would allow everyone to directly enjoy the fruits of the country's economic success, help the lower-income groups deal with rising prices and increase consumption around the country.\nRecent years have seen the government carry out a series of pro-poor   and pro-rural policies, including increasing spending on public healthcare and calling off the agricultural tax. But the lower-income group still needs more help while being hit hard by an 11-year high in prices and recent snowstorms.\nXing said while making the draft, he has borrowed many ideas from practices in countries like the United States and Singapore. Earlier this year, the governments of the two nations offered cash handouts to their citizens as the result of a surplus in government income. As for in China, \"We can even encourage the rich to donate their 1,000 Yuan red packet to the poor,\" said Xing.\nAlthough Xing's suggestion has gained wide support among ordinary Chinese on the Internet, many other economists criticized it as unpractical. Even Xing himself admitted he made the suggestion without any careful calculation. But they agreed with Xing's point that the growing economic pie should be shared among the people.\n\"To better use the increase of money, handing out money is not a solution that holds good for all time.

Wales, particularly South Wales, became a melting pot of European nationalities and cultures. At first workers from England, Ireland and the rural areas of Wales rushed into the coalfields of South Wales. By 1911, workers from Ireland, Italy and Spain had joined the industrial workforce there. Many of these newcomers were prepared to work for less pay.\nBut during this period, workers, dissatisfied with regular pay cuts, poor safety, the growing trend of employers to pay workers with tokens  , which could only be spent in the company store, returned to the land. In 1891, the rural population of Wales was about 616,000 and by 1911 just over 649,000 people lived and worked in these areas.\nThe rural population continues to grow slowly even today. People from richer parts of the UK, particularly southern England, are buying holiday or retirement homes in Wales. In some areas this has led to a shortage of affordable housing for local people. This, combined with the lack of employment prospects in rural Welsh communities, has started a new movement of people in search of jobs and homes into the towns and cities of Wales and to other parts of the UK and Europe.\nAs so many Welsh people have migrated to other countries over the last 200 years, it's really no surprise that many visitors come to see friends and  s -- there were 229,000 visitors in 1998. These visitors strengthen their links to their land of origin and continue to support the Welsh economy.

J.K Rowling's wizard is not alone.The past decade has been a harvest for good children's books, which has set off a large quantity of films and an increased sales of classics such as The Lord of the Rings.\nYet despite that, reading is increasingly unpopular among children.According to statistics in 1997, 23% said they didn't like reading at all.In 2003, 35% didn't.And around 6% of the children leave primary school each year unable to read properly.\nMaybe the decline is caused by the increasing availability of computes games.Maybe the books boom has affected only the top of the educational pile.Either way, Chancellor Cordon Brown plans to change things for the bottom of the class.In his pre-budget report, he announced the national project of Reading Recovery to help the children struggling most.\nReading Recovery is aimed at six year olds, who receive four months of individual daily half-hour classes with a specially trained teacher.An evaluation this year reported that children on the school made 20 months' progress in just one year, whereas similarly weak readers without special help made just five months' progress ,and so ended the year even further below the level expected for their age.\nInternational research tends to find that when British children leave primary school, they read well, but read text often for fun than those elsewhere.Reading for fun matters because children who are keen on reading can report lifelong pleasure and loving books is an excellent indicator of future educational success.According to the OECD, being a regular and enthusiastic reader is of great advantage.",

These popular cosmetics   are sold in more than 130 countries. Who's the woman behind this worldwide cosmetics empire  ? Estee Lauder herself, of course. This businesswoman became, for a time, the world's richest self-made woman. Her secret? \"I didn't get there by dreaming about it,\" she would say. \"I got there by doing it.\" Estee was born in the early 1900s in Queens, New York. Her father ran a hardware   store, and from him Estee learned how to be a successful salesperson. Estee learned from her uncle John Schotz, too. He made creams in a small laboratory behind the family's house. Estee watched him. Soon, she was experimenting with her own cosmetics. She put lipstick   and creams on any female relative who'd let her, until her annoyed father told her to stop.\nShe married Joseph H. Lauder in 1930, and continued her experiments. She would cook dinner for the family, and at the same time, make her face creams. Then she began to sell her products in a Manhattan beauty shop.\nIn 1960, Estee began to sell her products in Europe. After many tries she succeeded and began selling her products in some stores in London. But France proved even more difficult. The store Galleries Lafayette refused to sell her products.

        "The air bag is a piece of safety equipment in cars. It was first designed by John W. Hetrick in 1952. Like many inventions, he came up with the idea as a result of an event that had occurred in his life. He says:\n\"In the spring of 1952, my wife, my seven-year-old daughter, Joan, and I were out for a Sunday drive in our 1948 Chrysler Windsor. About three miles outside Newport we were watching for deer jumping across the road. Suddenly, there was a large rock in our path. I hit the brakes and we went into a ditch .\n\"As I applied the brakes, both my wife and I threw our hands up to keep our daughter from hitting the car. There was soft mud in the ditch, so the car wasn't damaged, and no one was hurt.\"\n\"During the ride home I couldn't stop thinking about the accident. I asked myself,'Why couldn't some object come out to stop you from striking the inside of the car?'As soon as I got home that night I drew some sketches . Each evening for the following two weeks, I'd add or reduce something from the sketches.\"\nHetrick applied an event he had observed while in the Navy to the design of the air bag. He was repairing a torpedo  which had a cloth covering. When the compressed  air that was in the torpedo was let out, the covering was suddenly filled with air and was shot to the ceiling.\nWith this knowledge, he developed his design until he was able to obtain a patent on the invention on August 5, 1952. The idea was similar to the air bag designs of today. Compressed air is stored in a container and when a traffic accident occurs and the car slows down at a rapid enough rate, the air will be released into the air bag. The idea was _ , but Hetrick's air bag never would have functioned properly. It was really a breakthrough, but it would require years and years of designing and testing by some top car designers before it could be used.\nThe car accident Hetrick was involved in   _  .\nA) damaged his car\nB) happened in 1948\nC) was caused by a deer\nD) caused no harm to his family",

The researchers warn that wearing such shoes from an early age can make it difficult to run in a healthy way. Once we have grown used to running in this kind of shoes, it is very difficult to change our technique, even if we remove our shoes, it can raise the risk of injury.\nChildren should be encouraged to wear shoes with thin soles such as plimsolls from a young age to help them develop a natural \"barefoot\" running style, experts said.\nDr Mick Wilknson, who did the research, told the British Science Festival in Newcastle, \"If I would advise someone on what to give their child, I would say don't go and buy them expensive Adidas or Nike, just get them a pair of flexible, flat shoes. Give them basic foot-ware, nothing fancy, nothing particularly cushioned.\"\nRunning in flat shoes, barefoot, encourages the runner to use the front of their foot which is a better technique for running, especially long distances as the human was designed to do.\nAround the world, and in particular in the US, running barefoot is becoming more and more popular with many long distance runners training without shoes.\nDr Mick Wilknson believes that training and running barefoot or in flat running shoes can help reduce injuries to runners, he said: \"Injury rates in running have not changed since the 1970s, despite claims of improvements in running shoes. That has led some to conclude that barefoot running is better.\"",

From 1893 he lived with his family in a house in Austin, Texas, which is now a museum. Visitors to Austin can see the house. It was saved from destruction   and turned into a museum in1934. The museum is a good way to learn about the interesting life of the American writer.\nWilliam Porter rented this house in Austin and lived there with his wife Athol and daughter Margaret for about two years. Many objects in the museum belonged to the Porters. Others did not. An important piece in the room is the original photograph over here. It was taken there in the house about 1895. The piano there goes back to the 1860s. His wife took lessons on it when she first moved to Austin.\nPorter did not start his career as a successful writer. He worked at a farm, land office and bank. He also loved words and writing. The museumm has a special proof of Porter's love of language --- his dictionary.

        "(CNN) -- In the last week, the Apple iWatch has made the jump from unlikely rumor to a real product that's probably in development, thanks to reports showing up in various publications.\nThe clues are planting the seeds of an Apple watch in consumers' minds. The general public has not been crying out for a better watch. And Apple prides itself on knowing what the people want before they do, and an Apple watch would be much more than just a fancy timepiece.\nIt's not about the watch form factor, but creating a wearable mobile device that takes advantage of advances in mobile computing technology such as cheap sensors, better battery life and improved voice recognition.\nIf executed correctly, an Apple watch could bring about a profitable industry of products to go with it, like it did with the iOS App Store and mobile applications.\n\"It's unlimited, the number of wearable things you can put into,\" said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, who imagines small companies making inexpensive products like belts with sensors that send warnings to the watch when you've eaten too much.\nApple is not entering virgin territory. There are already a handful of fancy smart watches available, but most act as accessories , connecting to the more powerful Android and iOS smartphones and tablets over Bluetooth.\nFor example, the new Pebble smart watch passes on alerts from a smartphone, so when you receive a text, e-mail, or Facebook notification it is pushed to the watch, which vibrates .\nWearable technology is also booming, thanks to cheap sensors that can be used to track things like movement and heart rates. The number of wearable fitness products has been growing at a fast pace, but an Apple offering would shake up the industry completely.\n\"We're finally getting some players involved, and Apple is the real one that can add some value to some of this wearable technology,\" said Munster.\nApple isn't alone in seeing the potential for this type of technology. Google is working on its own wearable platform, Google Glasses. The...\nIt's most likely that after the iWatch comes onto the market,   _  .\nA) a great many tablet computers will be off the shelf\nB) many relevant businesses will burst on the scene\nC) belts with sensors will made inexpensive\nD) a traditional wristwatch will be unnecessary",

Rather, I read in order to get a point of view. I searched books for good expressions and sayings, pieces of information, ideas, themes--anything to enrich my thought and make me feel educated. When one of my teachers suggested to his sleepy tenth-grade English class that a person could not have a \"complicated idea\" until he had read at least two thousand books, I heard the words without recognizing either its irony or its very complicated truth. I merely determined to make a list of all the books I had ever read. Strict with myself, I included only once a title I might have read several times.(How, after all, could one read a book more than once?)And I included only those books over a hundred pages in length.(Could anything shorter be a book?)\nThere was yet another high school list I made. One day I came across a newspaper article about an English professor at a nearby state college. The article had a list of the \"hundred most important books of Western Civilization.\" \"More than anything else in my life,\" the professor told the reporter with finality(firmly), \"these books have made me all that I am.\" That was the kind of words I couldn't ignore. I kept the list for the several months it took me to read all of the titles. Most books, of course, I hardly understood. While reading Plato's The Republic, for example, I needed to keep looking at the introduction of the book to remind myself what the text was about. However, with the special patience and superstition of a schoolboy, I looked at every word of the text. And by the time I reached the last word, pleased, I persuaded myself that I had read The Republic, and seriously crossed Plato off my list\nQuestion: While at high school, the writer   _  .\nOptions: A: had plans for reading\nB: learned to educate himself\nC: only read books over 100 pages\nD: read only one book several times",

Experts say the amount of carbonated soft drinks we consume  is growing. New research from the American Heart Association finds that drinking soda, even diet soda, may significantly increase your risk for heart disease. Dr. Ramachandran Vasan led the study. \"Drinking just one or more sodas a day may not be as innocuous as people think.\"\nIn a large study of 9,000 people, doctors discovered that those who drank one or more sodas a day had a 30% increased risk for obesity , a 25% increase in the risk for abnormal  blood sugar levels, and a 32% increase in the odds of having low levels of good cholesterol . \nAll of these factors increase the risk for heart disease. And there was no difference in the results for those who drank diet soda over regular soda. It's something that surprised even the researchers. \nCritics of the study say diet soda may not be the cause of increased risk of heart disease. Connie Diekman is president of the American Dietetic Association. \"It does not conclusively say that this will cause that.\"\nIn other words, it could be that unhealthy people like soda. Dr. Vasan found those who drink soda generally tend to have greater caloric intake. They eat more saturated fat and trans fats. They also eat less fiber and exercise less. Diet soda drinkers may also share this unhealthy lifestyle. Dr. Vasan agrees that the link he found between heart disease risk and diet soda needs additional study.\nQuestion: How does the writer present the passage?\n- By comparing opinions.\n- By giving advice.\n- By showing facts.\n- By discussing information.",

A study investigated whether taking notes by hand helps you learn better than taking notes on a laptop. It was no contest.\nStudy authors and psychologists Pam A. Mueller of Princeton University and Daniel M. Oppenheimer of the University of California- Los Angeles conducted three separate experiments involving a total of 327 students. All students got the same lectures, but some used laptops, and others took notes by hand.\nWhen it came to learning the concepts, the handwriters won. When it came to retrieving facts, the groups were comparable, except when given time to go home and look at their notes, at which point the handwriters did better.\n\"Even when allowed to reviewnotes after a week's delay, participants who had taken notes with laptops performed worse on tests of both factual content and conceptual understanding,\" the study states.\nLearning suffered not because of \"multitasking\" or the distraction available to students using Wi-Fi- enabled laptops. In the lab, scientists allowed no extraneous activity. Students who paid attention and took deep notes on their laptop still didn't learn as well--in fact, the study suggests the thoroughness of their notes contributes to the problem.\nLaptop users tend to record long, _ quotes, which they type mindlessly. Handwriters are more selective. They \"wrote significantly fewer words than those who typed,\" according to the study. By processing and selecting the more important information, they studied more efficiently, said researchers.\nHere's what's a bit frightening: When the laptop students were instructed to cut down or eliminate the verbatim note taking, they couldn't.

But for all the texts that are written, stored and sent electronically, a lot of them are still ending up on paper.\nIt is difficult to measure the quantity of paper used as a result of use of Internet-connected computers, although just about anyone who works in an office can tell you that when e-mail is introduced, the printers start working overtime. \"I feel in my bones this revolution is causing more trees to be cut down,\" says Ted Smith of the Earth Village Organization.\nPerhaps the best sign of how computer and Internet use pushes up demand for paper comes from the high-tech industry itself, which sees printing as one of its most promising new markets. Several Internet companies have been set up to help small businesses print quality documents from a computer. Earlier this week Hewlett-Packard Co. announced a plan to develop new technologies that will enable people to print even more so they can get a hard copy of a business document, a medical record or just a on-line e-mail, even if they are nowhere near a computer. As the company sees it, the more use of the Internet the greater demand for printers.\nDoes all this mean environmental concerns   have been forgotten?

It is a hard time for them, but it can be an exciting one as well. To make it easier, students need to get familiar with their school.\nEven though they've done this already in the middle school, it's still important to find where their classrooms are. Most schools take students to the high school for a visit at the end of their eighth grade year. And, most schools also have a freshman  speech for parents and students before the first year begins. Sometimes the main office will give away a map of the school. This can help students and parents to find different places in the school.\nOne way to know your high school more and make new friends is to join a club or play a sport. Schools often offer chances to join different clubs and sports. Fall activities begin in August before the first day of school. If you are not interested in sports, there are clubs for any interest, such as drama, dance, chess, photography, community service, etc. These clubs allow students from different grades. By joining an activity, students can find new friendships, not to mention improving their chances in future college applications  . The school office will have a list of activities offered at the school and information on how to join them.\nWhat's more, to have a great start to a high school year, students can write down some of their worries, and ask for help from teachers and school workers.\nQuestion: Which of the following is TRUE about the school clubs?\nYes or no, is the answer \"School officers can help new students join school clubs.\"?",

        "Read the following article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Every few years, we buy an expensive new PC and love how fast it runs. Unavoidably though, it starts to slow down until eventually we are pulling our hair out waiting for it to do tasks.\n  Why is this? It turns out the answer is quite simple and you don't even need to be \"technical\" to understand the causes and solutions. In most cases, the hardware you have is capable of being restored to its original function and kept in fast running condition with little effort.\n  Spyware  are software programs that are loaded on your computer without your permission. Most spyware and viruses get onto our computers through files that we download from the Internet or as attachments  to emails. They tend to take up a lot of computing power and , as a result, will slow down your computer.\n  The simple rule to follow is to never download any free software programs from companies you do not know and trust, especially screensavers, emoticons, and the like. In addition, you should never open any attachment to an email unless you are 100 percent certain you know and trust the sender. In addition, make sure you have a good anti-virus spyware removal software running at all times.\n  Every time you load a program, your PC's software registry  is updated with new instructions needed to operate that item. However, when the item is carried out, these instructions remain on your PC. Every time you run your computer it tries to execute these instructions but, because the related program can't be founded, it causes a registry error. Your PC is doing a lot more work than it should be and the result is a slower computer.\n  One of the best ways to manage this is with a neat little tool from Support.com. You can now get a free working version of the software which will quickly scan your entire PC and identify all of the registry errors. The free version also scans for junk and checks your PC. It will deal with the first 100 errors for free, and if you have more to clean up, you can easily upgrade to the full version for just $29.95.\nQuestion: Where is this passage most probably taken from?\n- A new report\n- A computer advertisement\n- A scientific report\n- A web advertisement",

In the old days the educational institutions   were called \"ashramam\" and teachers were \"gurus\". A guru was a respected person in society. \nNow we are living in the technological world. Big changes are occurring in people's living. The influence of television, telephone, radio, computer, Internet and mobile phones is very strong in everyday life. But even today, teachers are role models for students. Teaching is still a respectable job. But there are great changes in the education system.\nOne of the most obvious changes is that the influence of Western culture has increased. We are paying too much attention to doing business, just like the Western world. Teachers are likely to to be influenced by this too, but it is not good. Teachers are nation builders. The development of any country depends upon its education system. All types of development are possible through education.\nAnother change has happened in the curriculum  . The curriculum connects the teacher and the student. While education is about learning, curriculum means the situations in which one learns.

        "Article: We live in a sweet world. The average American kid eats more than 20 teaspoons of sugar per day, and adults eat 50% more sugar today than they did in the 1970s. We all know that too much sugar isn't good for you. But did we know it could be dangerous? A team of researchers at the University of Utah used mice to do a study on the bad effects of sugar. They found it could have serious effects on people's health.\nSugar is found not only in sweets and candies, but also in many household items like pasta and crackers.\nDuring the 58-week-long study, mice were fed a diet containing 25% more sugar. This percentage equals a healthy human diet along with three cans of soda daily. The team found that these mice were twice as likely to die as mice fed a similar diet without the sugar. Though the mice did not show signs of obesity or high blood pressure, male mice produced 25% fewer offspring   than the other mice.\nScientists often use mice for research because they have a similar genetic   structure to humans. \"Since most substances   that are dangerous in mice are also dangerous in people, it's likely that those physical problems that cause those mice to have increased deaths also work in people,\"says study author James Ruff of the University of Utah. Findings from this study show bad effects that are not as noticeable as weight gain or heart problems. Sugar can contribute to long-term changes in the body that can change development and even shorten lives.\nCutting sugar out of the American diet altogether may be difficult. But making the effort to control our nation's sugar need will provide for a truly sweeter future.\nQuestion: According to the study, which of the following statements is wrong?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Eating much more sugar can make mice put on weight and get high blood pressure.\"?",

Before they left, they asked me for advice about how to find accommodation  . I suggested that they should stay at \"bed and breakfast\" houses, because this kind of accommodation gives a foreign visitor a good chance to speak English with the family. My friends listened to my advice, but they came back with some funny stories.\n\"We didn't stay at bed and breakfast houses,\" they said, \"because we found that most families were away on holiday.\"\nI thought this was strange. Finally I understood what had happened. My friends spoke little English, and they thought \"VACANCIES\" meant \"holidays\", because the Spanish word for 'holidays\" is \"vacaciones\". So they did not go to house where the sign  outside said 'VACANCLES', which in English means there are free rooms. Then my friends went to house where the sign said 'NO VACANCLES', because they thought this meant the people who owned the house were not away on holiday. But they found that these houses were all full. As a result, they stayed at hotels!\nWe laughed about this and about mistakes my friends made in reading other signs. In Spanish, the word 'DIVERSION' means fun. In English, it means that workmen are repairing the road, and that you must take a different road. When my friends saw the word 'DIVERSION' on a road sign, they thought they were going to have fun. Instead, the road ended in a large hole .\nEnglish people have problems too when they learn foreign languages. Once in Paris when someone offered me some more coffee, I said 'Thank you' in French. I meant that I would like some more.  However, to my surprise,  the coffee pot was taken away! Later I found out that 'Thank you' in French means 'No, thank you.'\nOptions:\nA learning English\nB finding places to stay inEngland\nC driving their car on English roads\nD going toEnglandby car\nAnswer:\nB finding places to stay inEngland\nQuestion:",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article:\nArticle: Laughter healing  benefits and healing with laughter have become synonymous with Norman Cousins, the man who laughed himself to wellness. Norman Cousins was the editor of SaturdayReviewfor over 30 years.\nHis story began in 1964, when doctors found that the connective tissue in his spine was becoming worse, which is a condition known as Ankylosing Spondylitis . The doctors, one of whom was a close friend of Cousins, said that his chance of survival was approximately 1 in 500. He read about the theory that negative emotions do harm to the body, so he thought that if negative emotions were damaging to health, then positive emotions should improve health.\nFaced with the real possibility of his approaching death, Cousins thought long and hard and eventually did three things completely contrary to medical opinion.\nFirst he began his own research on all of the various drugs he was on. He discovered that his condition was removing Vitamin C from his body and, based on Cousins' personal research, doctors agreed to take him off several of the drugs he was on and inject  him with large doses of this supplement , as Cousins felt this may be his last hope.\nSecondly, Cousins made a decision to check out of the hospital and into a hotel room. The third thing Cousins did was get a movie projector  and a large supply of funny films. On his first night in the hotel Cousins found that he laughed so hard at the films that he was able to stimulate chemicals in his body that allowed him several hours of pain-free sleep. When the pain returned he would simply turn the projector back on and the laughter would help sleep, and he was able to measure the changes in his body by measuring his blood sedimentation rate , and found that this rate dropped by at least 5 points each time he watched one of these videos.\nThe treatment proved to be so effective that in very little time Cousins was off all painkillers and sleeping pills.

Everybody seems to be competing with someone at some level. Each week we spend hours playing or watching others compete in sporting activities all over the world. We cannot help being impressed by the level of excellence that these people achieve.\nIn sport and business, competition encourages excellence in performance. Where there is no competition, improvement in performance is less likely. Some level of competition is a have-to in all aspects of life.\nThe following story makes this point.\nAs two friends are hiking in the forest they come across a huge, ferocious and obviously hungry bear. Its next meal has just come into sight, and they are it! The first friend calculates that the bear will catch them in 27.3 seconds. At that point, she panics, realizing there is no escape. She faces her friend, with the fear of death in her eyes. To her amazement, she observes that her friend is not scared at all. On the contrary, her friend is quickly but calmly taking off her hiking boots and putting on running shoes. \"What do you think you're doing?\" the first hiker says to her companion. \"You'll never be able to run faster than that bear\". \"That's true,\" says the companion, \"but all I have to do is escape, faster than you.\"\nWe all compete when the motivation is strong enough. However, competition is not the real purpose of life. Fulfilling the measure of our creation can only be achieved individually.\nMost of time, we are not in competition with any other person, so we do not have to compare ourselves with others. There is only one person that can fulfill our role and that is us. This means that others cannot beat us to the finish line because there is no race. This is not to say that others do not have a similar role to us, but it is never the same. This is important to understand if we are going to enjoy life. Every human being is unique and cannot be cloned. In this, I am not referring to the body, only to the spirit, soul, or the essence of a person.\nQuestion: Why is the story of two friends told in the passage?\nOptions: A: To advise friends to be loyal even in competition.\nB: To expose the weak side of friendship when tested.\nC: To support the author's own argument on competition.\nD: To persuade people to beat others, even friends.",

Today , these advanced technologies are part of the real world. They are common at work, the bank, the airport, and your local prison. The iris scan, fingerprint scan, and voice scan are all examples of biometrics  a fast developing area of automatic personal identification technology . Basically , biometrics uses various ways to verify a persons identity , based on the individual's unique characteristics ,including fingerprints , voices, irises, body heat patterns, facial images, handprints , signatures and so on.\nBiometrics identification systems have a number of advantages over password systems. The primary advantage is that an individual has to be physically present in order to be identified. Another important advantage is that there are no passwords to remember , forget, lose or steal.\nThe voice scan is the simplest and most affordable form of biometrics . It only requires a computer, a microphone and the correct software. The software records a subject's voice and then compares it to a stored voice sample for identification purposes.\nFor additional safety, fingerprint and handprint scans can also be employed . Fingerprint scans take the image of a fingerprint and compare it to a stored file of prints. Handprint scans identify the unique features of a hand.\nIris scans currently give the highest level of accuracy among all the available biometrics systems.

Our bodies are also about 70 percent water. When there is no gravity that water moves up toward the head, raising pressure in the skull. Arms and legs grow weaker at what is called zero gravity because they no longer need to push against the force of gravity.\nFive years ago, astronauts who spent weeks in space reported a change in their eyesight. These astronauts were members of the crew on the International Space Station. Research showed a change in the shape of their eyes. Normally-round eyeballs had become flat during time in space. The research also showed that the right eye was affected more than the left, and that men were more affected than women. Scientists could not find an explanation for the differences.\nBone loss was one of the problems first reported by astronauts returning to Earth after longer stays in space. So scientists designed exercise machines to use on the space station. Tests showed that the exercise equipment helped space travelers keep their bones almost as strong as when they left Earth.\nThere are other health issues for astronauts who spend a long time in space. They may have problems eating and sleeping. But the biggest health issue is exposure to radiation. On Earth, human beings are protected by the atmosphere and the planet's magnetic field.

In the nineteen eighties, Michael Jackson made a record album called \"Thriller\". It quickly became the most popular recording in the history of music and it made Michael Jackson a superstar.\nThe word \"super\" means more than usual or very wonderful.

At that time Muhammad Ali was even better known than the president of the United States.

The landscape looks dull, with hills, sky and forest appearing gray. My spirits ebb, as they did during an April snowfall when I first came to Maine 15 years ago. \"Just wait,\" a neighbor advised. \"You'll wake up one morning and spring will just be here.\" \nAnd look, on May 3 that year I awoke to a green so amazing as to be almost electric, as if spring were simply a matter of flipping a switch. Hills, sky and forest revealed their purples, blues and green. Leaves had unfolded and daffodils were fighting their way heavenward. \nThen there was the old apple tree. It sits on an undeveloped lot in my neighborhood. It belongs to no one and therefore to everyone. The tree's dark twisted branches stretch out in unpruned  abandon. Each spring it blossoms so freely that the air becomes filled with the scent of apple. \nUntil last year, I thought I was the only one aware of this tree. And then one day, in a bit of spring madness, I set out with pruner to remove a few disorderly branches. No sooner had I arrived under the tree than neighbors opened their windows and stepped onto their porches. These were people I barely knew and seldom spoke to, but it was as if I had come uninvited into their personal gardens. \nMy mobile-home neighbor was the first to speak.\"You're not cutting it down, are you?\" she asked anxiously. Another neighbor frowned as I cut off a branch. \"Don't kill it, now,\" he warned. Soon half the neighborhood had joined me under the apple tree. It struck me that I had lived there for five years and only now was learning these people's names, what they did for a living and how they passed the winter. It was as if the old apple tree was gathering us under its branches for the purpose of both acquaintanceship and shared wonder. I couldn't help recalling Robert Frost's words: \nThe trees that have it in their pent-up buds  \nTo darken nature and be summer woods  \nOne thaw led to another.

However, despite years of competition in overseas markets, Japan's cellphone makers have little presence beyond the country's shores.\nThe only Japanese cellphone maker with any meaningful global share is Sony Ericsson, and that company is a London-based joint venture between a Japanese electronics maker and a Swedish telecommunications firm.\nAnd Sony Ericsson has been hit by big losses. Its market share was just 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, behind Nokia of Finland, Samsung Electronics and LG of South Korea, and Motorola of Illinois.\nThis year, Mr Natsuno, who developed a popular wireless Internet service called i-Mode, invited some of the best minds in the field to debate how Japanese cellphones could go global.\n\"The most amazing thing about Japan is that even the average person out there will have a very advanced phone, \"said Mr Natsuno. Japan has 100 million users of advanced third-generation smart phones, twice the number of the United States, a much larger market. Many Japanese rely on their phones, not a PC, for Internet access.\nIndeed, Japanese cellphone makers thought they had positioned themselves to dominate the age of digital data. But they were a little too clever. In the 1990s, they set a standard for the second-generation network that was refused everywhere else. Then Japan quickly adopted a third-generation standard in 2001. However, it made Japanese phones too advanced for most markets.\nSeveral Japanese companies are now considering a push into overseas markets, including NEC. Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Fujitsu are said to be planning similar moves.\n\"Japanese cellphone makers need to either look overseas, or exit the business\", said Kenshi Tazaki, a managing vice president at the consulting firm Gartner Japan.\nOptions:\nA Because their technical standards are too advanced to be accepted overseas.\nB Because they only produce advanced cellphones.\nC Because they used the second-generation network earlier than others.\nD Because their phones are more advanced than PCs.\nAnswer:\nA Because their technical standards are too advanced to be accepted overseas.\nQuestion:",

But a recent survey suggests that such women find more joy from relationships, rather than successful careers.\nAbout 73 percent of the 7,000 women surveyed in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou said they would choose to work even if their husbands earned enough for the family. The survey also found that 77 percent define happiness as \"enjoying a relationship\".\nBut striking a balance between career and family can bring challenges to the woman's career advancement.\n\"In my company, women usually have an equal or even a higher starting salary than men,\" said Li Hua, general manager of Beijing Chuangjiashe Book Circulation Company. \"However, as they begin to climb up the career ladder, women often meet problems along the way, while men can climb the ladder more easily.\"\nBoth physical and emotional differences can prevent some women from taking tough positions, Li said. But family life is often the main difficulty for Chinese career women.\nDespite these challenges, however, some experts believe it's reasonable for some women to want to be breadwinners.\n\"In this way, the roles of a family are decided by the parents' abilities rather than their gender ,\" said Gu Donghui, a sociology professor at Fudan University.\nGu says women should have the freedom to decide if they want to stay at home or work to support the family. \"Everyone has a different interpretation of what it means to find self-worth\".\nWang Haibin, an economic expert from Renmin University shares that view: \"Traditionally, we tend to regard the family as the cell unit of society. Some members have always been expected to make sacrifices for it. But, it really doesn't matter who earns more. Economic independence and personal choice is essential for both sexes in the family.\"\nQuestion: What's the main problem that career women meet while working?\n- Physical difference\n- Tough positions\n- Family life\n- The career ladder",

Of the 2500 national health service hospitals in Britain, almost 100 now have very valuable collections of present art in passages, waiting areas and treatment rooms.\nThese recent movements first started by one artist, Peter Senior, who set up his studio at a Manchester hospital in northeastern England during the early 1970s.He felt the artist had lost his place in modern society, and that art should be enjoyed by a wider audience .\nA common hospital waiting room might have as many as 5 000 visitors each week. What a better place to hold regular exhibitions of art! Senior held the first exhibition of his own paintings in the out--patient's waiting area of the Manchester Royal Hospital in 1975.Believed to be Britain's first hospital artist. Senior was so much in demand that he was soon joined by a team of six young art school graduates.\nThe effect is striking. Now in the passages and waiting rooms the visitor experiences a full view of fresh colours, playful images and restful courtyards.\nThe quality of the environment may reduce the need for expensive drugs when a patient is recovering from an illness. A study has shown that patients who had a view onto gardens needed half the number of strong pain killers compared with patients who had no view at all or only a brick wall to look at.\nQuestion: Some best artists of Britain have been called in to  _  .\nOptions: A: set up new hospitals\nB: make the corners of the hospital collect paintings\nC: bring art into hospitals\nD: help patients recover from serious illnesses",

He was captured and spent 6 years in a communist Vietnamese prison.\nOne day, Plumb and his wife were sitting in a restaurant when a man from another table came up and said \"You're Plumb! You flew jet fighters in Viet Nam from the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk. You were shot down!\"\n\"How in the world did you know that?\" asked Plumb.\n\"I packed your parachute,\" the man replied. \"I guess it worked\". Plumb assured him, \"It sure did. If your chute  hadn't worked, I wouldn't be here today.\"\nPlumb couldn't sleep that night, thinking about that man. Plumb says, \"I kept wondering what he looked like in a Navy uniform: a white hat, a bib in the back, and bell-bottom trousers. I wonder how many times I might have seen him and not even said 'Good morning. How are you?' or anything because, you see, I was a fighter pilot and he was 'just a sailor'\".\nPlumb thought of the many hours the sailor had spent at a long wooden table in the bowels of the ship, carefully weaving the shrouds  and folding the silks of each chute, holding in his hands each time the fate of someone he didn't know.\nSometimes in the daily challenges that life gives us, we miss what is really important.

        "Article: The Norwegian government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down(though these have already been raised) ; and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the government will be able to hold things back for long. \nEver since the war, the government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. For the past few years this program has had a great deal of success: Torso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern city could be in ruins. \nThe effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 per cent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. \nThe real argument over the oil industry is its effects on the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as real Norwegians. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most against the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the sea and to the countryside and to the whole country. \nOne Norwegian politician said last week, \"We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.\"\nQuestion: Norwegian farmers and fishermen have an important effect because   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"Norwegians respect them as representatives  of Norwegian culture\"?",

        "Article: Noise pollution in cities is causing out health to suffer, according to the World Health Organization. Recently, researchers at the Free University of Brussels in Beigium have developed an applocation: NoiseTube. It allows everyone who downloads it the ability to measure the amount of noise they are exposed to by transforming their smart phone into a sound level meter.\nNoiseTube works by recording sound levels and GPS locations. Once launched the app shows decibel  levels of green or red depending on the level of noise. That information is then sent to the NoiseTube server via the Internet where a \"noise map\" is produced and then made available to the user.\nSince its launch, the app has been popular with community groups who want to monitor their own noise levels. According to D'hondt of the Noise Tube project, these groups don't think that city produced noise maps give an adequate interpretation of the level of noise they're experiencing. City produced noise maps are based on statistical models involving very few actual measurements. \nNoiseTube on the other hand gives a detailed account of the level of noise experienced at a specific time and location. \"Ten people walking the same area from 9 to 10 am every day for one week can make a valid  and detailed map for an area of a couple of blocks,\" D'Hondt said. \"It's reasonable effort by the community groups to produce these maps, and with it they can go to the authorities and have real evidence about what they're experiencing.\"\nSo far these sorts of noise maps have been produced for a number of European cities. The app has been downloaded by 10,000 people with 2,700 people registered on the NoiseTube website.\nQuestion: How does NoiseTube produce a \"noise map?\"\nYes or no, is the answer \"The NoiseTube server analyzes noise information vis the Internet.\"?",

But he still felt cold and uncomfortable.\nThe man was on his way to a camp near Henderson Creek. His friends were already there. He expected to reach Henderson Creek by six o'clock that evening. It would be dark by then. His friends would have a fire and hot food ready for him.\nA dog walked behind the man. It was a big gray animal, half dog and half wolf. The dog did not like the extreme cold. It knew the weather was too cold to travel.\nThe man continued to walk down the trail. He came to a frozen stream called Indian Creek. He began to walk on the snow-covered ice. It was a trail that would lead him straight to Henderson Creek and his friends.\nAs he walked, he looked charily at the ice in front of him. Once, he stopped suddenly, and then walked around a part of the frozen stream. He saw that an underground spring flowed under the ice at that spot. It made the ice thin. If he stepped there, he might break through the ice into a pool of water. To get his boots wet in such cold weather might kill him. His feet would turn to ice quickly. He could freeze to death.\nAt about twelve o'clock, the man decided to stop to eat his lunch. He took off the glove on his right hand, opened his jacket and shirt, and pulled out his bread and meat. This took less than twenty seconds. Yet, his fingers began to freeze.\nHe hit his hand against his leg several times until he felt a sharp pain. Then he quickly put his glove on his hand. He made a fire, beginning with small pieces of wood and adding larger ones. He sat on a snow-covered log and ate his lunch. He enjoyed the warm fire for a few minutes. Then he stood up and started walking on the frozen stream again.\nA half hour later, at a place where the snow seemed very solid, the ice broke. The man's feet sank into the water. It was not deep, but his legs got wet to the knees. The man was angry. The accident would delay his arrival at the camp. He would have to build a fire now to dry his...\nQuestion: Why did the man choose to walk on a trail with snow-covered ice?\nOptions: A: Because it was the shortest route.\nB: Because the scenery around was wonderful.\nC: Because it was a path advised by his friends.\nD: Because it was the only way to his destination.",

Without Leap Day ,which takes place every four years, that could happen.\nOur calendar is normally 365 days long. It was created to match the cycles of the seasons. But Roman ruler Julius Caesar noticed a problem: The earth doesn't circle the sun in exactly 365 days. It actually cakes 365 and one-quarter days. He figured out that the extra part of a day would cause the calendar to grow apart from the seasons over time. Over 100 years, the seasons would shift  about 24 days. Spring would start on April 13 instead of March 20.\nCaesar used math to figure out a way to stop the calendar from shifting. He decided to add an extra day to the month of February every four years. His idea helped keep the seasons and calendar matched up. Even so, it still wasn't perfect--his calendar was adding too many days.\nIn 1582, Pope Gregory XIII worked on Caesar's idea. His calendar, called the Gregorian calendar, declares that every year that is equally divided by 400 is a leap year. Turn-of-the-century years, or years ending in \"00\", would not be leap years unless they could be divided equally by 400. These complicated equations help keep the calendar in balance with the orbit of the earth. Today, we still use the Gregorian calendar. In about 3,000 years, the calendar will be only one day out of step with the seasons, It's still not perfect, but mathematicians decided it was as close as we could get.",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article:\nArticle: Decision-making under Stress\nA new review based on a research shows that acute stress affects the way the brain considers the advantages and disadvantages, causing it to focus on pleasure and ignore the possible negative   consequences of a decision.\nThe research suggests that stress may change the way people make choices in predictable ways.\n\"Stress affects how people learn,\" says Professor Mara Mather. \"People learn better about positive than negative outcomes under stress.\"\nFor example, two recent studies looked at how people learned to connect images  with either rewards or punishments. In one experiment, some of the participants were first stressed by having to give a speech and do difficult math problems in front of an audience; in the other, some were stressed by having to keep their hands in ice water. In both cases, the stressed participants remembered the rewarded material more accurately and the punished material less accurately than those who hadn't gone through the stress.\nThis phenomenon is likely not surprising to anyone who has tried to resist eating cookies or smoking a cigarette while under stress -at those moments, only the pleasure associated with such activities comes to mind. But the findings further suggest that stress may bring about a double effect. Not only are rewarding experiences remembered better, but negative consequences are also less easily recalled.\nThe research also found that stress appears to affect decision-making differently in men and women. While both men and women tend to focus on rewards and less on consequences under stress, their responses to risk turn out to be different.\nMen who had been stressed by the cold-water task tended to take more risks in the experiment while women responded in the opposite way. In stressful situations in which risk-taking can pay off big, men may tend to do better, when caution weighs more, however, women will win.\nThis tendency to slow down and become more cautious when decisions are risky might also help explain why women are less...",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\nArticle: Researchers at Stanford University have developed a new material that can move heat out of buildings and into space. The researchers say the material can cool buildings even on hot days. The cooling material is a very thin sheet with many layers that could be placed on a roof like solar panels . However, instead of turning sunlight into energy as solar panels do, the material turns heat into radiation.\nShanhui Fan is an electrical engineering professor at Stanford University. He says that the panels have a layer of material that is like sand. The panels act like a mirror. They take heat out of buildings and reflect the light from the sun. And he says both the heat and sunlight are sent 100 kilometers into outer space. \"It's a structure  that cools itself without electricity input, even under the sun. So, what it does is basically radiate heat to outer space and also reflect the sunlight so it doesn't get heated up by the sun. Mr. Fan says it is like having a window into space. The heat is sent directly into space without warming the air.\"\nHe says buildings in developing countries that do not have electricity or air conditioning could use the panels. \"In areas where electricity is out of reach for many people, there is a potential   benefit for storing medicine or even food. In many of these situations, being able to reduce the temperature is important. And this would provide a way to do it.\"\nThe researchers say the main problem is creating actual cooling systems using the high-tech panels. They say it may be possible to develop a cooling spray  that could be used on present solid structures. They believe the cooling spray technology could be developed in the next three to five years. They say as much as 15 percent of the energy used in the United States is spent providing power to air conditioning systems.\nOptions:\nA The appliance of the new panel is still under research.\nB Some people got benefits from producing the panels.\nC People may have problems in using the new material.\nD The new panels may save 15 percent of the energy.\nAnswer:\nA The appliance of the new panel is still under research.\nQuestion:",

        "Read the article and select the best answer.\nArticle: On May 23rd the United States Department of Agriculture will meet to discuss the pressing topic of wild pigs. These beasts, which number 6 million or so, are an increasing bother. At their worst, they can damage crops, spread diseases, attack humans and kill farm animals. And things are getting worse: a study show that they are likely to double in number over the next 3 years. Why is it so hard to control wild pigs?\nIntroduced to America in the 16th century, and related to the wild pigs found in Europe, wild pigs can be found in 75% of all states. No single law exists to control them and regulations differ between states: while in Missouri they can only be shot if met by chance, in Texas hunting is actively encouraged. A \"pork chopper\" law allows Texan hunters to shoot wild pigs from helicopters, and some people in Louisiana have even built their own pighunting drone . As well as being popular with hunters, wild pigs are cheaper for game raisers to breed than deer. In Michigan and Pennsylvania suggested bans on the private breeding of pigs for hunting have caused quarrels between game raisers and wildlife officials.\nWild pigs' double nature----considered pests by farmers, but valued by hunters----makes it hard to pass laws  to control them. Two other factors also contribute. Nearly 70% of land in America is privately owned. And it is difficult for lawmakers to impose breeding and hunting laws on private landowners. Secondly, it is hard to define a wild pig.\nIn some states, laws are being introduced to redefine the term \"wild animal\" to keep out wild pigs. This is good news for those raising pigs for hunting, but less are to those who consider them pests whose number should be limited. Meanwhile, discussions continue over how to deal with this problem.\nQuestion: Which is NOT the reason for the difficulty in controlling wild pigs?\nOptions: A: The difficulty of passing effective laws.\nB: The high percentage of land owned privately.\nC: The farmers' unwillingness to shoot wild pigs.\nD: The popularity of raising wild pigs in many states.",

Everyone is worried about education and global warming. What about animals? We should not ignore them just because they cannot talk to us. Animals, like us humans, have rights. Every living being has the right to warm shelter and good food, but most importantly, they have the right to be wanted and loved.

There are organizations that deal with this issue, but that does not mean that we still shouldn't help. The biggest saying that bothers me is, \"I am only one person.

Legare, a professor at the University of Texas.\nMs. Legare brought in 96 children aged 3 to 5 and set before them a complex toy made up of colorful, interlocking gears  . With the first group, the researchers asked, \"Can you explain this to me?\" With the second one, they said, \"Look, isn't this interesting?''\nThe two groups of children focused on different things, researchers found. Children who were asked to observe noticed the colors of the toy, while those asked to explain focused on the chain of gears working on each other.\nChildren who had explained the toy were better at re-creating it and not being disturbed by decorative gears, and they were better able to use what they had learned who had observed the toy outperformed the children in the explanation group on a memory task focused on the toy's colors.\nDedre Gentner, the director of the cognitive science program at Northwestern University, said that teachers introducing a concept can improve students' understanding  by  giving examples of close comparisons,  and then asking children to explain how concepts are related.\nIn a series of experiments with 3-to 7-year-olds, she focus children can be con be confused by comparisons that focus on a relationship rather than a direct-object match.\nFor example, a 3-year-old shown a picture of two rabbits facing each other and told \"this is a toma '' and then asked to find another \"tome\" will choose a picture of a rabbit over one of two cats facing each other 98 percent of the time.

Rovio is the name of the company that created angry birds, however, it's not the first game they developed. Surprisingly they have been creating games for several years but had just never broken through into the mainstream the way they did with angry birds. The idea for the game came about in 2009 when the company was looking at different ideas for games which they thought could become popular. It was a simple idea _ from some sketches  of wingless and legless birds which were angry.\nThe sketches caught on among the staff who in turn created a unique design which became angry birds. The pigs were added into the game later in the development as an enemy. During this period of development, pig flu was being heavily reported in the news which is where the idea for the pigs appeared.\nThe basis of the game is very simple and is not unique to angry birds but has been seen in many other games previously. It's a simple physics/puzzle game. The player is given a slingshot and a limited supply of angry birds with different characteristics. Some birds are faster than others while others can be split into multiple birds. You control the trajectory  of the birds with the slingshot which launches them towards rickety structures containing your main enemy, the pigs. In order to advance to the next level you must eliminate  all of the pigs before your birds run out.\nRovio has released several different versions of the game at this point. The original, Seasons, and Rio. Seasons is a collection of holiday themed versions of the game while Rio was a movie tie in for the movie Rio. All versions continue to be updated with new levels which are free to those who have previously purchased the game.\nQuestion: In the game, the birds   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"have to be controlled to kill all of the pigs before your birds run out\"?",

How many of them are football fans? 100 million! All of them think they know all about football. This makes life very difficult for the Brazilian team managers. When things go bad for the Brazilian team, the newspapers would demand that the team manager should leave his job. \"If we win, they me in heaven,\" a manager once said. \"If we lose, they put me in hell .\"\nYou can't escape football in Brazil. There are football matches on every street and beach. On television, the results of football matches come before the main news programs. There are six television channels  in Rio de Janeiro. On Sundays each channel shows a different football match.\nBrazil is not the richest country in the world, but the government spends lots of money on football. It cost more than one billion pounds to prepare for the 1978 World Cup. That's 10 pounds for every Brazilian man, woman, and child. And many Brazilians don't earn as much as 10 pounds a week. Is it worth it?\n\"Brazil must have a great football team,\" says one journalist. \"If it costs one billion pounds, that's all right. If the government doesn't give us a good team, then it will become unpopular. Football is more than a game in Brazil.\"\nFootball is more than a game in Brazil. This is certainly true in its largest city, Sao Paulo. The most popular team is Corinthians. Corinthians' fans are the most loyal and emotional in Brazil.

The bandits also took two oil paintings by well-know Brazilian artists Emiliano Di Cavalcanti and Lasar Segall, said Carla Regina, a spokeswoman for the Pinacoteca do Estado museum.\nThe Picasso prints stolen were \"The Painter and the Model\" from 1963 and \"Minotaur, Drinker and Women\" from 1933, according to a statement from the Sao Paulo Secretary of State for Culture, which oversees the museum. The prints and paintings have a combined value of $612,000, the statement and a museum official said.\nAbout noon, three armed men paid the $2.45 entrance fee and immediately went to the second-floor gallery where the works were being exhibited, bypassing more valuable pieces, authorities said. \"This indicates to us that they probably received an order\" to take those specific works, Youssef Abou Chain, head of Sao Paulo's organized crime unit, told reporters at a news conference. The assailants overpowered three unarmed museum guards and grabbed the works, officials said. The robbery took about 10 minutes and the museum was nearly empty at the time. The assailants took the pieces -- frames and all -- out of the museum in two bags. The institution has no metal detectors.\nIn December, Picasso's \"Portrait of Suzanne Bloch\" and \"O Lavrador de Cafe\" by Candido Portinari, an influential Brazilian artist, were stolen from the Sao Paulo Museum of Art by three men who used a crowbar and car jack to force open one of the museum's steel doors. The framed paintings were found Jan. 8, covered in plastic and leaning against a wall in a house on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, South America's largest city. One of the suspects in that robbery -- a former TV chef -- turned himself over to police in January, who already had two suspects in custody .\nWhat did the armed men steal on Thursday?\nA) Two prints by Pablo Picasso\nB) Two oil painting by Brazilian artists\nC) Two prints by Pablo Picasso and two oil paintings by two Brazilian artists.\nD) Two prints by two Brazilian artists and two oil paintings by Picasso Pablo.",

Unique among architecture schools, this program is compulsory for all members of the class, and students frequently refer to it as their reason for applying to Yale.\nThis year's class of 64 worked to design, develop and document an idea for a 2,100-square-foot, wheelchair-accessible, two-family house. Students had to use sustainable resources and energy-efficient technology. The budget for the project is always less than actual construction costs, and the builders-in-training had to seek supplementary donations, mostly in the form of construction materials.\nThe result this year was a \"designer\" home, dressed entirely in cedar , fitted inside with Swedish-designed cabinetry  and partially powered by solar energy. The floors are bamboo, another natural material prized for being quickly replenished . This year, the student-builders used a pre-cast foundation system, which, in addition to its other labor-saving virtues, uses 75% less concrete than the poured system.

But Guido Daniele creates fantastic paintings of birds, elephants, tigers, and giraffes by painting on skin. Born in Soverato, Italy, Guido Daniele has been called\"Ha nd Gogh\" (after artist Vincent van Gogh) since he began creating works of art on people' s hands in 1990.\nPainting on the hands can be a challenge because, unlike canvas, the skin moves when rubbed. Daniele' s models must remain perfectly still for hours as he paints. He often uses his daughter and his son as his \"canvases\".\nBefore he can begin to create his \"manimals\" ( the artist' s name for his hand animals), Daniele studies photographs of the animal that he will be painting in order to be able to understand its character and give it life. \"Next,\" he says, \"I look at the hand from different perspectives   ,and I begin to imagine what is the best way to position the hand for me to paint the animal. \"He also studies the skin of the model, preferring it to have little hair and few blemishes  .\nDaniele starts by drawing on the model' s hand with a pencil. He next paints the skin using watercolor1s made specifically for body art. The eyes of Daniele' s painted animals look amazingly real, and they are the most difficult part to paint.\nPaintings on hands must eventually be washed away. Guido Daniele says that he's gotten used to this part and that he doesn' t really mind seeing his work washed down the drain  . \" Tomorrow, I will paint the next one.

We speak different languages, and have different customs and dresses.\nIf we were to break each of these further, we would have quite a long list of qualities and characteristics that make humans appears to be different from each other. I say they appear to be different, because most of what have been listed stand for what we see or hear, not what is true of human. Man is man everywhere. It is only where he lives, when he lives there, with whom he lives there, and al the others that have effect on how he lives, that is, what he believes, what he wears, his customs, his language and so on. These are man-made facts that each group develops over tome, living together, facing the same problems, needing and desiring the same things. They are his culture. The truth is that we are much more same than different. If you wear one type of clothing and I wear another, we both wear some kind of clothing. Our culture demands it. If you speak one language and I another, we both speak so that others will understand us; we must communicate with each other. Nothing is gained by giving too many differences, but much is lost.

It means that we are seeing nearly 3000 deaths a day in China, or two deaths every minute, related to smoking.\nAccording to O'Leary, about 26 percent of men who die from smoking-related diseases in China die before the age of 60. People who can still contribute a great deal, in other words, are dying too young.\nChina has tried to ban smoking , but more efforts are needed.\nMore than half of chronic diseases are preventable by changing lifestyles and reducing risks. The four key risk factors are: smoking, diets high in fats, salt and sugar, environments that prevent physical activities, and alcohol consumption. These are the areas on which efforts to make changes need to concentrate.\nOptions:\nA The amount of salt consumed\nB The number of deaths caused by high blood pressure.\nC The number of people with cardiovascular disease.\nD The number of people with high blood pressure.\nAnswer:\nA The amount of salt consumed\nQuestion:",

        "If you really want to go green, here's good news: eating green is good for you. The very foods with a high carbon cost---meat, pork, dairy products, processed snacks---also tend to be filled with fat and calories. A green diet would be mostly vegetables and fruits, whole grains, fish and lean meats like chicken---a diet that's eco- and waistline-friendly. Eating green can be healthier and beneficial to the climate.\nIt may be hard to believe that a meal at McDonald's produces more carbon than your trip to a far away place. More than 37% of the world's land is used for agriculture, much of which was once forested. Deforestation   is a major source of carbon. The fertilizer   and machinery needed on a modern farm also have a large carbon footprint, as does the network of ships and trucks that brings the food from the farm to your plate.\nThe most efficient way to reduce the carbon footprint of your menu is to eat less meat, especially beef. Raising cattle takes a lot more energy than growing the equivalent   amount of grains, fruits or vegetables. What's more, the majority of cattle in the U.S. are fed on grain and loads of it---670 million tons in 2002---and the fertilizer used to feed that creates separate environmental problems.\nFocus on eating lower on the food chain, with more plants and fruits and less meat and dairy. It's simple. We can change today what goes into our bodies for the health of our planet and ourselves.\nWhat is the passage mainly about?\nA) The benefits of eating green.\nB) How to reduce the carbon.\nC) The change of our menu.\nD) The ways of keeping healthy.",

Even if you do nothing about it, your bad mood will probably go away after some time. But with a little effort, you can forget it much faster - often within a day or two.\n*Walk it off\nExercise is the most popular bad-mood buster. A person who's in a bad mood has low energy and high tension. Taking a fast ten-minute walk, or doing some quick exercises can do wonders towards changing that bad mood.\n*Tune it out\nListening to your favorite music for a while can also make tension go away quickly, because music starts associations with past positive experiences we've had.\n*Give yourself a pep talk\nStop and listen to what's on your mind. Bad moods are often started by too many negative thoughts. Write them all down on paper, the pessimistic messages you've been giving yourself and then give optimistic answers. ( \"I still don't have a job.\" Vs \"I have two interviews next week.\")\n*Reduce your stress\nRelaxation techniques are wonderful mood-lifters. These include deep breathing, stretching and visualizing, all of which sound complicated but aren't. One easy way to visualize: close your eyes and picture a favorite place, such as the beach. Another simple way to be against distress is to make a to-do list. One reason for being in a bad mood is feeling you have no options. By taking control over certain areas, you realize you're not helpless. You can make changes in your mood and life.\n*Avoid things that won't improve your mood.\nTV may not help much: You need to increase your energy level and stimulate  your mind - something that the TV show \"Neighbors\" won't do. And before you reach for that piece of cake and coffee, think about how mood and food are linked. Sugar and caffeine contribute to depressed moods. A better choice? Research shows that carbohydrates, such as potatoes and pasta ,produce a calming effect in people who have a desire for them.\nQuestion: Which of the following may help us stop a bad mood?\n- Doing nothing about it.\n- Exercising and enjoying music.\n- Writing down negative thoughts.\n- Talking about it with neighbors.",

Do you like to post photos of yourself in restaurants to show others what an exciting life you have? Or do you like to write about how happily in love you are? Or perhaps you are of the subtle type who constantly complain about jobs but really just want to impress others with your important position.\nAccording to the results of a series of experiments conducted by Harvard University neuroscientists , the reward areas of our brain----the same areas that respond to \"primary rewards\" such as food ----are activated when we talk about ourselves. We devote between 30 to 40 percent of our conversation time to doing just that. Unfortunately, Bernstein says, some people can't tell the difference between sharing positive information that others might actually want to know and direct bragging. She suggests that bragging involves comparison, whether stated or implied.\n\"We are expected to be perfect all the time. The result is that more and more people are carefully managing their online images\". says Elizabeth Bernstein, a columnist with the Wall Street Journal.\nBut the issue is not limited to the Internet. In a fiercely competitive job market we must sell ourselves on multiple platforms and show that we are better than others. In fact, we have become so accustomed to bragging that we don't even realize we are doing it, says Bernstein. This is harmful to our relationships and puts people off.\nBernstein talked to some experts who said that people brag for all sorts of reasons: to appear worthy of attention; to prove to ourselves we are doing fine and that people who said we would fail are wrong; or simply because we're excited when good things happen to us.\n\"Feel sorry for them, because they're doing this unconscious, destructive thing that won't help them in the long run,\" said Professor Simian Valier, a research psychologist at...\nQuestion: What can we infer from the passage?\nAnswer:",

        "Article: Freedom and Responsibility\nFreedom's challenge in the Digital Age is a serious topic. We are facing today a strange new world and we are all wondering what we are going to do with it.\nSome 2,500 years ago Greece discovered freedom. Before that there was no freedom. There were great civilizations, splendid empires, but no freedom anywhere. Egypt and Babylon were both _ , one very powerful man ruling over helpless masses.\nIn Greece, in Athens  , a little city in a little country, there were no helpless masses. And Athenians willingly obeyed the written laws which they themselves passed, and the unwritten, which must be obeyed if free men live together. They must show each other kindness and pity and the many qualities without which life would be very painful unless one chose to live alone in the desert.The Athenians never thought that a man was free if he could do what he wanted. A man was free if he was self-controlled. To make yourself obey what you approved was freedom. They were saved from looking at their lives as their own private affair. Each one felt responsible for the welfare of Athens, not because it was forced on him from the outside, but because the city was his pride and his safety. The essential belief of the first free government in the world was liberty for all men who could control themselves and would take responsibility for the state.\nBut discovering freedom is not like discovering computers. It cannot be discovered once for all. If people do not prize it, and work for it, it will go. Constant watch is its price. Athens changed. It was a change that took place without being noticed though it was of the extreme importance, a spiritual change which affected the whole state. It had been the Athenian' s pride and joy to give to their city. That they could get material benefits from her never entered their minds. There had to be a complete change of attitude before they could look at the city as an employer who paid her citizens for doing her work. Now instead of men giving to the state, the...\nQuestion: What change in attitude took place in Athens?\nYes or no, is the answer \"The Athenians refused to take their responsibility.\"?",

        "Read the article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Scientists from England's Newcastle University have discovered that bacteria have the ability to detect smells, according to a study by the university on Sunday.\nThe team of scientists, led by Dr. Reindert Nijland, discovered that bacteria can detect certain types of smell- producing chemicals, including  ammonia   that is produced by other bacteria. Once they sense the smells from other kinds of bacteria, the bacteria will gather together to form a colony   and form a layer of slime   in order to force the competitors out of their area. The response decreases as the distance between the two bacterial colonies increases.\nThat slime, also known as biofilm, is one of the primary causes of infection on many medical implants . Biofilms also slow down ships and are believed to cost the marine industry millions of dollars annually. However, they can also be used to clean up spilled oil floating on the sea, as they grow strong on it.\n\"This is the first evidence of a bacterial 'nose'able to detect potential competitors,\" Dr. Nijland said in the August 15 statement, which confirms that bacteria possess qualities similar to four of the five senses that humans enjoy (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell), the others being touch, taste, and sight.\n\"The fact that bacteria formed slime when exposed to ammonia has important significance for understanding how biofilms are formed and how we might be able to use them to our advantage,\" he added.\nTheir findings were published in Sunday's edition of biotechnology journal, and could change the way scientists look at how each of the senses developed over time.\n\"It was thought for a long time that smell existed only in complex living creatures,\" Dr. Nijland said. \"Now we see that bacteria are able to do the same, so the indication is that the ability may have developed even earlier.\"\nQuestion: We learn from the text that biofilms   _  .\nOptions: A: may cause oil to spill\nB: can be used to benefit humans\nC: are the major causes of infection\nD: are more likely to be found on ships",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article:\nArticle: We start finding things laughable -- or not laughable -- early in life. An infant first smiles at approximately eight days of age. In his book Beyond Laughter, psychiatrist Martin Grotjahn says that the earlier infants begin to smile and laugh, the more advanced their development is. Studies revealed   that children who did not develop these responses \"developed a schizophrenic psychosis   in later life, or simply gave up and died\".\nBetween the ages of six months and one year, babies learn to laugh for essentially the same reasons why they will laugh throughout their lives, says Dr. Jacob Levine. He says that people laugh to express mastery over an anxiety. Adult laughter is more subtle  , but we also laugh at what we used to fear. The feeling of achievement, or lack of it, remains a leading factor. Giving a first dinner party is an anxious event for newly-weds. Will the food be good? Will the guests get along? All goes well; the party is over. Now they laugh freely. Their pleasure is from recalling the evening's activities. They couldn't enjoy the second pleasure without the first.\nLaughter is a social response caused by signals. Scientists have not determined a brain center for laughter, and they are puzzled by patients with certain types of brain damage who go into laughing with no apparent reason. The rest of us require company and a reason to laugh. Another reason why laughter is pleasurable is because of the physical feeling involved.\nAccording to Dr. Levine, we can measure our adjustment to the world by our capacity   to laugh. When we are secure about our abilities, we can make fun of our weakness. If we can laugh through our anxieties, we will not be overpowered   by them.\nThe ability to laugh starts early, but it takes a lifetime to perfect. Says Dr. Levine, \"When social relationships are mastered, when individuals have mastered... a peaceful relationship with themselves, then they have ... the sense of humor.\" And then they can throw back their heads and laugh.",

One bag of Nacho Cheese Doritos has 310 milligrams. Pizza is one of the biggest problems for teens when it comes to sodium, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\"The additional benefit of lower salt intake early is that we can hopefully change the expectations of how food should taste, ideally to something slightly less salty,\" says Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, the lead author of the study and associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\"Most of the salt we eat is not from our salt shaker , but salt that is already added in food that we eat.\" she added.\nQuestion: Which is a benefit of a low sodium diet according to the text?\nOptions: A: No risk of heart disease.\nB: Smaller chance of stroke.\nC: Low blood pressure.\nD: Slightly more heart attacks.",

It seemed like this would be a good time to let my teenage daughter Holly practice her driving, so I sent her to the store in my truck. At dinner my son talked about how much he liked my truck. I enjoyed having it, but I said, \"Guy, my heart is not set on that truck. I like it but it is just metal and won't last forever. Never set your heart on anything that won't last.\" After hearing the loud noise, the whole family ran outside. My son shouted, \"Dad! Dad! Holly crashed your truck.\"\nMy heart sank and my mind was flooded with conflicting thoughts. Was anyone hurt? Who else was involved? As I ran to the door, I heard a voice in my heart say, \"Here is a chance to show Holly what you really love. She'll never forget it.\"\nThe accident had occurred in my own driveway. Holly had crashed my truck into our other vehicle, the family van. In her inexperience, she had confused the brakes and the gas pedal  . Holly was unhurt physically but when reached her, she was crying and saying, \"Oh, Dad, I'm sorry. I know how much you love this truck.\" I held her in my arms as she cried.\nLater that week a friend dropped by and asked what had happened to my truck. I told her the whole story. Her eyes moistened  and she said, \"That happened to me when I was a girl. I borrowed my dad's car and ran into a log that had fallen across the road. I ruined the car.

Health officials are warning that failure to repair cavities can lead to social and emotional problems.\nWagner Marcenes is with the Institute of Dentistry at Queen Mary, University of London. He led a team of researchers as part of the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study. About 500 researchers attempt to collect and examine studies about all major diseases. They used the information to estimate rates of the infection.\nThe report says untreated tooth decay is the most common of all 291 major diseases and injuries. Professor Marcenes says cavities or holes  in permanent teeth are also known as caries.\n\"Caries is a chronic disease that shares the same risk factors as cancer, cardiovascular disease. What we're having now is an increase in disease from highly developed countries happening in sub-Saharan Africa and probably it will be in other areas of Africa, too.\"\nHe says an increase in tooth decay in Africa could be a result of developing countries becoming more like Western nations.\n\"It is likely to be related to a change in diet.

The name Easter itself derives from Europe, the Anglo-Saxon goddess of springtime and sunrise. Christians relate the rising of the sun to resurrection of Jesus, Son of God, and therefore Easter, like Easter, represents rebirth of the soul. \nIt is because of this association of the holiday with rebirth that the egg has long been its chief symbol. The egg was a symbol of spring and fertility (for the egg is the original germ from which all life proceeds) long before the Christian era. The ancient Persians, Greeks and Chinese exchanged eggs at their spring festivals. In Christian times the egg took on a new meaning, symbolizing Christ's tomb---a cold and hard casket from which new life finally broke forth in triumph. In modern times the egg is still the most important part of Easter customs. Egg-rolling contests, egg hunts and egg-dyeing are still very popular with Americans at Easter time. Today Easter is more a family day than a religious holiday. Relatives and friends get together for large Easter dinners. Many American and friends get together for large Easter dinners.

After two years on the job, he finally asked for a small salary. The owners told him he \"wasn't good enough to be paid.\" So he quit, and found a paying job at another local flower shop. He worked hard there, but after six months they _ because business was slow.\nNot discouraged, Roger decided to do it alone and started his own flower store in a basement in his town. He started his business with only sixty-five dollars. He bought old refrigerators at garage sales and knocked the shelves out. This turned them into coolers for his fresh-cut flowers. His business grew rapidly as he built up a reputation for top quality and fine service.\nIn 1977, Roger bought out the flower store where he had worked without pay for over two years.

The invention, called the world's first breathable food by its creators, let consumers suck in the taste of chocolate and coffee while taking on less than one calorie. Its makers claim it will enable dieters to enjoy their favorite snacks without worrying about their waistline.\nThe lip-stick-style tube contains hundreds of milligrams of tiny food particles which are small enough to become conveyed by air, but too large to enter the lungs. Each Le Whif contains enough flavor about eight to ten whiffs  and costs $1.99 on its own or $4.99 for a pack of three. The inhaler is available in chocolate, raspberry chocolate and mint chocolate models as well as coffee flavor, which gives a dose of caffeine equivalent to a small short of strong black coffee.\nIt was invented by Prof. David Edwards. He said Le Whif was not designed to replace food but could be used to increase dining experience, such as allowing people to sample a variety of dishes from restaurant menus before ordering their meals He said, \"In terms of living off whiffing we aren't even close to being there. But there clearly has been a revolution over the last few years where we are eating smaller amounts of food more frequently, and choosing food or its aesthetic  pleasure. We will be launching new whiffing experiences probably every six months. It is reasonable to assume that the next line of whiffing products will be even more health-centered.\nThe product that was released in Paris in 2009 and the initial production run of 25,000 inhalers were sold out within a month. It has since been made available across France and in the US.

        "About 6 percent of luxury hotels in three major Chinese cities have stopped serving shark fin ,a survey has found. Although the controversial dish remains on the menu at most hotels, Green Beagle Environment Institute, a Beijing-based non-government organization that was the main sponsor of the survey, said the results are encouraging and reflect increased awareness.\nThe survey was carried out in Beijing, Shenzhen and Fuzhou, which were selected as representative cities to collect basic data on shark fin consumption nationwide. In Beijing, 132 hotels completed the phone questionnaire between Nov. 20 and Dec. 12. Only 12 hotels, 9 percent, said they do not serve shark fin. A similar survey of 131 Beijing hotels conducted a year ago found only one hotel that did not serve shark fin, Wang Xue, chief coordinator of the survey, said on Saturday.In Shenzhen, four out of the 85 four and five star hotels surveyed had stopped serving shark fin, accounting for about 5 percent. In Fuzhou, only one of the 40 hotels surveyed did not serve shark fin. On average, about 6. 61 percent of the hotels in the three cities did not serve the food.\n\"The survey reminded us there is still a long way to go to remove shark fins from Chinese hotels and restaurants, but the improved situation in Beijing is encouraging,\" said Wang. \"We found more hotels and restaurants were willing to take action over the past year.\" International hotels are more active in the \"shark-fin-free\" project, she noted. China is the world's biggest importer and consumer of shark fin, which has been used in luxurious Chinese dishes for 500 years. Dishes made from shark fin are still regarded as a symbol of honor and respect,especially at business dinners, according to Wang.\nResearch has also found that shark fin contains poisonous elements, but the nutritious value is less than that of chicken or pork. \"We hope hotels and restaurants remove shark fin products from their menus,\" Wang added.\nAccording to the text, which city did the best this year?\nA) Shanghai\nB) Shenzhen\nC) Fuzhou\nD) Beijing",

It was said that the staff in another building next to us all ran out of the building with their handbags; some of them even drove away. On hearing that, I thought it was a bitexaggeration .

To research whether such a \"sixth sense\" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments.\nIn the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them.\nFor the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed.\nBaker concludes that people do not have the ability to sense when they're being stared at.

His father was Alfred Lee Loomis , a rich New York City businessman .In 1940, Henry Loomis dropped out of Harvard University to join the United States Navy .He was able to put to good use his knowledge of radar technology that he had learned about because of his father's work .After graduating at the top in his naval  training class, Henry Loomis became a teacher at the Navy's radar training school in Hawaii. By the end of World War Two, Henry Loomis had received many honors for his service, including a Bronze Star and an Air Medal.

He held positions in the Department of Defense and other agencies: In 1958, he became director of the Voice of America.\nDuring his travels around the world, Mr. Loomis saw that English was becoming an\nimportant international language. He believed that it was important to make English easier to\nunderstand by listeners of VOA broadcasts whose native language was not English. So Mr. Loomis asked VOA program manager Barry Zorthian to develop a way to broadcast to listeners\nwith a limited knowledge of English:\nThe result of this effort was Special English: The first Voice of America broadcast in Special English took place on October 19th, 1959. Those against his ideas at the time said the Special English method of broadcasting at a slower rate with a limited vocabulary would never work, it was not practical. American embassies  demanded that the program be called off. But Mr. Loomis supported the program.\nSoon, VOA began to receive hundreds of letters from listeners praising the program. Special English programs became some of the most popular on VOA. We are pleased to say that our programs still are.\nQuestion: Those who were against his ideas of Special English programs said  _\nYes or no, is the answer \"Special English programs were not practical\"?",
