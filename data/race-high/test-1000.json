The word tycoon is relatively new to the English language. It is Chinese in origin but was given as a title to some Japanese generals. The term was brought to the United States, in the late nineteenth century, where it eventually was used to refer to magnates who acquired immense fortunes from sugar and cattle, coal and oil, rubber and steel, and railroads. Some people called these tycoons \"capitals of industry\" and praised them for their contributions to U.S. wealth and international reputation. Others criticized them as cruel \"robber barons\", who would stop at nothing in pursuit of personal wealth.\nThe early tycoons built successful businesses, often taking over smaller companies to eliminate competition. A single company that came to control an entire market was called a monopoly. Monopolies made a few families very wealthy, but they also placed a heavy financial burden on consumers and the economy at large.\nAs the country expanded and railroads linked the East Coast to the West Coast, local monopolies turned into national corporations called trusts. A trust is a group of companies that join together under the control of a board of trustees. Railroad trusts are an excellent example. Railroads were privately owned and operated and often monopolized various routes, setting rates as high as they desired. The financial burden this placed on passengers and businesses increased when railroads formed trusts. Farmers, for example, had no choice but to pay, as railroads were the only means they could use to get their grain to buyers. Exorbitant   goods rates put some farmers out of business.\nThere were even accusations that the trusts controlled government itself by buying votes and manipulating elected officials. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust. Act, legislation aimed at breaking the power of...\nIt seems likely that many Americans  _  .\nA) believed that the trusts had little influence over government\nB) expected the wealthy magnates to share money with the poor\nC) did little to build up American business\nD) were worried that trusts might manipulate the government",

On May 1, there were constant traffic jams on highways leading out of the several metropolises, the longest, according to reports, was 55 kilometers. Some blame the jams on the two-year-old policy that allows cars with no more than seven seats to use the highways for free on public holidays, but a Beijing News editorial said this is not the real cause of the jams.\nThe growing automobile culture is doubtlessly among the causes. Data shows that China's production and sales of automobiles both went up by 20 million in 2013. But over the same period there has been no breakthrough in highway construction, and _ \nGrowing tourism also leads to the jams. At the 2014 global summit of the World Travel and Tourism Council, which ended last week, it was reported that Chinese people spent almost 3 trillion yuan on tourism in 2013, which took up more than 90 percent of hotel income and more than 80 percent of air and railway use.\nWorse, Chinese have to travel during the same periods. As employees' rights to paid leave often fail to be protected, many have no choice but to travel on the limited public holidays. From Oct 1 to 7, the so-called Golden Week, almost every tourist site will be full of visitors. Therefore it is wrong to blame the free-pass policy.\nThat does not mean the government should stand idle doing nothing. As traffic jams during the holidays are predictable, they could develop more public transport and strengthen legal supervision to ensure that every employee enjoys their entitlement to a paid vacation or offer free passes on other days to encourage people to travel on days other than public holidays. The measures might not prevent traffic jams, but they may at least ease the jams.\nOptions:\nA two\nB three\nC four\nD five\nAnswer:\nB three\nQuestion:",

Many use drugs or have diseases or mental problems.\nLast year, I came back to Puerto Vallarta from my university in Mexico City. I spent one year as a volunteer with an organization called Outreach International. They have several programs. I volunteered for one program to help street children.\nI worked in a home for street children (all boys, at this one). At this home, the boys have a place to sleep and three meals daily. The home keeps the boys off the streets. It shows them another way of life. As a volunteer, I helped to prepare meals. I taught games---such as basketball, football and art.

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: IT'S a mystery that has puzzled scientists. Five years ago, researchers found an area in the Atlantic Ocean seabed, where a part of the Earth's outer layer, or crust , is  missing. A thick layer of dark green rock, which is usually found deep inside the planet, lies exposed.\nThe crust, mantle  and core  are the main layers that make up the planet. The mantle rests between the crust and the core.\nLast month, a team of 12 British scientists set off on a six-week trip to study the hole in the crust.\nThe hole is about 4,800 meters below sea level and is believed to be more than 48,000 meters long and more than 48,000 meters wide. Scientists think that there are other nearby gaps. \"It is like a window into the interior   of the Earth,\" says scientist   Bramley Murton, who is part of the research team.\nThe site where the hole is located is part of a ridge   of undersea volcanoes.  There, two of the plates that make up the Earth's surface meet. The plates are always   moving. When the plates move away from each other, lava rushes up from the mantle to   fill the gap and form a new crust. But this did not happen in the area where the hole is located.\nThe hole is giving researchers a good opportunity to study what's below the Earth's   surface. The team will use a special robotic tool to film the area and get samples of the exposed mantle. They hope to study everything from the chemistry of the oceans to how the Earth's surface behaves under the sea.\nQuestion: For the main layers of the earth, which one is right?\nOptions: A: crust, mantle, core\nB: seabed, crust, mantle\nC: seabed, mantle, core\nD: crust, seabed, core",

I saw a credit card statement, another credit card statement and our bank statements. It was in that moment that I felt a deep tension.\nI realized that even though I had married a man who I absolutely loved and adored, I really didn't have a clear sense of how he handled money and how the two of us were going to combine our different approaches to handling money in our marriage. I was more organized and detailed, but he was more of a _ type. I knew that getting on the same financial page was a key factor in creating a successful marriage and financial future.\nI asked my husband if he would be willing to set up a time each week to talk about our finances and develop a plan for getting rid of our credit card debt. My husband said he would be willing to do this. Admittedly, he was skeptical -- but willing.\nWe came to refer to our weekly meetings as our Financial Dates. We didn't really have a clue as to what we were doing. All we knew was that we needed to give our finances serious attention. Some Dates were filled with tense conversations. Other Dates were filled with laughter, joy and creativity. However, we kept showing up for our Dates and we never gave up. What started out as a means for survival became a powerful connecting thread in our relationship. Something shifted within us.\nInstead of our finances becoming a source of divisive tension that pulled us apart, they became\nthe glue that held us together as we became a unified team.\nI still recall the day that we excitedly crossed off our last credit card payment on the chart we had created. We had finally arrived. We were free. We had been given wings to fly.\nNow, whenever I feel huge stress I ask myself, \"How am I contributing to what is happening right now?\" This gives me the ultimate power to take action. Even though my husband and I don't have any guarantee against future challenges, I am left with something deep within that is unshakable and that can never be taken away...\nQuestion: Why did the author feel nervous when collecting the afternoon mails?   _\nOptions: A: She was not sure about her marriage.\nB: She didn't know how to handle money.\nC: She could feel the pressure of the huge debt.\nD: She was reminded of the quarrels in the family.",

        "Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: Most people think that the capital of the movie world is Hollywood in the United States. However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \"Bollywood.\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollywood--more than 800 films a year.\nThe movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \"masala\" film. (\"Masala\" is an Indian word for a mixture of species.)\nAnother big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writer can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script   by hand instead of taking time to type it.\nBollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot  scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million US dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million US dollars for a Hollywood film, thirty times as much!\nQuestion: What is the main topic of the reading?\nAnswer:",

No one seems to be able to determine which is which, creating a lot of confusion for people who are truly concerned with buying the best and healthiest products.\nIn 2000, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published its official position on organic foods and made its production controlled by a strict law. While there are several standards for organic foods, foods must be grown without the use of antibiotics ,growth hormones ,chemical things and so on. The leaves of plants are one of the best choices.\nOn the other hand, natural foods have no legal rules, and are not controlled by any law. The USDA does require that seller should list the parts of natural foods, but there are no official rules for the amount of natural parts a food must contain. A natural food is usually considered to contain less chemical things, though there is no way to keep an eye on the product.\nThe USDA has guidelines for organic production. When considering buying organic foods, you must take into consideration that the organic meat, eggs and milk products must come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones.\nDue to higher labor costs, organic products cost 40% to 120% more compared with their natural foods. The most important thing to remember is to eat a variety of healthy foods, organic or natural foods. Eating more fruits, vegetables, low-fat and whole grains will be good for our health.",

Islanders point to the desert insects that land on beaches after a 5,000-kilometer flight across the Atlantic.

        "Lawmakers in the United States have expanded an investigation into the use of location-tracking systems on mobile devices. The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security.\nAllan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data.

They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer.\nAllan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns.

        "Read the following article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Lawmakers in the United States have expanded an investigation into the use of location-tracking systems on mobile devices. The action follows recent reports about the storing of information on the Apple iPhone. Some people consider location tracking to be a threat to personal privacy and security.\nAllan Friedman, the research director, says, \"All wireless companies do some location tracking as part of their networks. This information is usually stored by the companies, not the devices, and there are laws to protect it. Law enforcement  agencies, for example, have to have a fairly high standard before it can access that data. And the phone company is also prohibited from selling that information.\nNow, two researchers report that location tracking information is being stored directly on Apple devices. They said Apple's newest operating systems gather global positioning system and timestamp information. The information is stored on the device in a file that is also uploaded   to any computer that the device is connected to. The researchers say the information is available to anyone who has access to the device or computer.\nAllan Friedman says, \"This raises additional concerns. There's the idea that because it's on my phone and on my computer, rogue applications  that I pay for or that I'm tricked into downloading may be able to access this data and somehow misuse it.\"\nApple says it is \"not tracking the location of your iPhone\". It is simply keeping a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell phone towers near the user's location. This information is meant to help the iPhone quickly find its location when needed.\nLetters have been sent to some of the leading mobile device developers, including Apple and Google. The letters asked for more information about their location tracking systems. Allan Friedman calls this an important start to strengthening privacy laws. He says, \"There aren't strong controls over things like location information, what they are doing with it, how long they are keeping it.

I never heard any noise from the children, but the parents were always _ at them.\nWe often met. I always spoke, but the only answer I ever got was a hello from a four-year-old girl. One day when I returned, they were just coming back to their apartment and the little girl was holding the door in the hall open for the others. I remained in the car doing unnecessary things. The parents were telling her to hurry. I looked up and saw the little girl was still holding the door open, waiting for me. I hurried as much as I could and thanked her. She was smiling from ear to ear.\nThat afternoon I was at the K-Mart and saw a white teddy bear. I thought of the little girl and said to myself, \"I bet she would like it.\" So I bought it for her.\nThe next day there was a knock on the door and it was the little girl and her father. She was so proud of her bear and thanked me. Then I noticed her mother and the other children were there in the hall, too.\nNow when we meet in the hall, we all speak in a friendly manner. Last night we had about four inches of snow. The temperature was below zero. When I opened the outside door, there was my car with all the snow removed. The man next door was the only person I knew in the whole building, so when I saw him the next day, I asked him if he was the nice person that removed the snow. He said NO. He wanted to, but his wife said she wanted to do it.\nIsn't it amazing that the small kind act of a four-year-old girl can change so many things for the better?\nOptions:\nA Children should be polite to their neighbors.\nB People should be kind and communicate with each other.\nC Your neighbors are not as bad as you think.\nD Things can be changed by removing snow.\nAnswer:\nB People should be kind and communicate with each other.\nQuestion:",

        "Egypt: Bridging the Gap between School English and Real English\nTeaching English in Egypt in general and in my town Damietta in particular, is mainly directed towards helping students to pass their final exams. Unfortunately, most teachers do not adopt a long -term approach that guarantees that their students will be able to use English outside the classroom. So students only concentrate on one skill which is writing. Thus their listening and speaking skills are disabled. What is important to them is to pass the exam which is primarily based on writing .Teachers are not only concentrated with providing their students with questions that are similar to those of the final exam, particularly General Secondary Education Certificate (GSEC) Examination, so students spend most of their time answering typical exam questions.\nMost students' scores are high; a lot of students get full marks. However, few students are able to communicate in English because their role plays. As a result, a lot of students complain that they are unable to understand and talk fluently with native speakers of English.\nTo enable students to communicate freely and spontaneously  in English, I bring features of real communication into language practice, I always ask students about their own experiences, and suggest groups of students practice what they have learned outside the classroom. This helps lower-achieving students absorb language. Furthermore, role play is a very effective way to improve speaking skills particularly if it is connected to the experience of the students.\nWhich of the following statements is true according to the passage?\nA) Most of the students can't get high marks but can communicate with the native speakers of English.\nB) Communicating skill is more important than writing skill.\nC) Role play connected to the speaker's experience is more effective \nin improving his skill.\nD) The lower--achieving students can do better in speaking skill than the upper achieving students.",

        "Article: Many of us already know about several American superstitions . Having a black cat cross your path, walking under a ladder, and breaking a mirror are all bad luck. In addition to these, there are many other superstitions that are worth knowing. Understanding them will keep you safe from evil spirits--if you believe in such things--and impress your American friends when you mention them.\nLike the superstitions in other cultures, American superstitions often involve the things important in daily life, such as health, numbers, and marriage. For example, have you ever had a cough that would not go away? According to one American superstition, you should take a piece of your hair and put it between two slices of buttered bread. Next, feed this hair sandwich to a dog and say, \"Eat well, you hound, may you be sick and I be sound.\"This will trick the evil spirits and help your cough. _ .\nIn American superstitions, the number three is very important. Often, Americans will say, \"All things come in threes.\" Three is lucky because it represents the traditional family: mother, father, and child. Therefore, gifts, letters, and guests will often arrive at your home in groups of three. However, it is also possible for bad events, like accidents and funerals, to come in threes as well.\nAnother time people pay attention to superstitions is when they get married. During a wedding, brides must wear or carry\"something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.\"The old and borrowed things will bring luck to the person who gives them to the bride. The new and blue things will bring good fortune to the bride herself. The next time someone you know is getting married, be sure to recite this phrase.\nAs it would be unlucky to discuss one more superstition, we will wind things up here. Keep your fingers crossed, and stay lucky!\nQuestion: In American's view, the number three is a(n)  _  number.\nYes or no, is the answer \"special\"?",

Yet they like to think of themselves as little people, average men, and they would like to cut everything down to their own size.

They play games as if they were fighting a war, and fight wars as if playing a game. They marry more, and go broke more often. They love children, animals, mother, work, excitement, noise, nature, television shows, comedy, high pace, sports, the underdog, the hero, the flag, Christmas, jazz, shapely women and muscular men, classical recordings, crowds, comics, cigarettes, warm houses in winter and cool ones in summer, thick beefsteaks, coffee, ice cream, informal dress, plenty of running water, do-it-yourself, and a working week limited to forty hours or less.\nThey crowd their highways with cars while complaining about the traffic, troop to movies and television while blaming the quality and the advertisements, go to church but don't care much for sermons  , and drink too much in the hope of relaxing--only to find themselves drunk into even bigger dreams.\nThere is of course, no typical   American.

A stupid joke at that. I mean, what sort of _ would take a perfectly good, perfectly famous bridge and move it halfway around the world to some no-name town in northwest Arizona? Back in 1962 when all this started, Lake Havasu City was nothing. A couple of shops, a couple of homes, and no tourism at all.\nIt turns out Robert McCulloch is the moron in question, and he wasn't quite the moron I thought he was. His 2.45 million dollar investment in the 130-year-old bridge--which the British government was selling because it was about to fall into the Thames--ended up being the investment of a lifetime. You see McCulloch was a real businessman, among other things, and his money paid off big. He turned Lake Havasu into one of the most visited tourist attractions in Arizona.\nIt took nine long years to take down the bridge, ship it brick by brick to the middle of nowhere, and build it up again. When it finally did open up in 1971, it was a huge deal covered by the international press.\nThe bridge is now a popular tourist attraction, and there's even a mini \"English Village\" at the foot of the bridge with souvenirs and real British food so you can have a good old time.\nNowadays Lake Havasu is a busy town with a population of about 56,000 citizens and another2.5 million visitors each year. Most of that is during spring break when the town overflows with energetic boys and girls. Even MTV and the Girls Gone Wild people get in on the action. All thanks to that little bridge.\nI don't know about you, but I'm saving my pennies. When the French get sick of that Eiffel Tower, I'll be the first to put money on it. It'll look great in my backyard.\nQuestion: Why did the British government put the London Bridge up for sale?\nAnswer:",

Back in 1962 when all this started, Lake Havasu City was nothing. A couple of shops, a couple of homes, and no tourism at all.\nIt turns out Robert McCulloch is the moron in question, and he wasn't quite the moron I thought he was. His 2.45 million dollar investment in the 130-year-old bridge--which the British government was selling because it was about to fall into the Thames--ended up being the investment of a lifetime. You see McCulloch was a real businessman, among other things, and his money paid off big. He turned Lake Havasu into one of the most visited tourist attractions in Arizona.\nIt took nine long years to take down the bridge, ship it brick by brick to the middle of nowhere, and build it up again. When it finally did open up in 1971, it was a huge deal covered by the international press.\nThe bridge is now a popular tourist attraction, and there's even a mini \"English Village\" at the foot of the bridge with souvenirs and real British food so you can have a good old time.\nNowadays Lake Havasu is a busy town with a population of about 56,000 citizens and another2.5 million visitors each year. Most of that is during spring break when the town overflows with energetic boys and girls. Even MTV and the Girls Gone Wild people get in on the action. All thanks to that little bridge.\nI don't know about you, but I'm saving my pennies. When the French get sick of that Eiffel Tower, I'll be the first to put money on it. It'll look great in my backyard.\nQuestion: What was Lake Havasu City like before 1962?\nYes or no, is the answer \"It was a small town with no tourism.\"?",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article:\nArticle: I had worried myself sick over Simon's mother coming to see me. I was a new teacher, and I gave an honest account of the students' work. In Simon's case,the grades were awfully low. He couldn't read his own handwriting. But he was a bright student. He discussed adult subjects with nearly adult comprehension. His work in no way reflected his abilities.\nSo when Simon's mother entered the room, my palms   were sweating. I was completely unprepared for her kisses on both my cheeks. \"I came to thank you,\" she said, surprising me beyond speech. Because of me, Simon had become a different person. He talked of how he loved me, he had begun to make friends, and for the first time in his twelve years, he had recently spent an afternoon at a friend's house. She wanted to tell me how grateful she was for the self-respect I had developed in her son. She kissed me again and left.\nI sat, stunned, for about half an hour,wondering what had just happened. How did I make such a life changing difference to that boy without even knowing it?What I finally came to remember was one day, several months before,when some students were giving reports in the front of the class, Jeanne spoke quietly,and to encourage her to raise her voice, I had said, \"Speak up. Simon's the expert on this. He is the only one you have to convince, and he can't hear you in the back of the room.\" That was it. From that day on, Simon had sat up straighter, paid more attention, smiled more,and became happy. And it was all because he happened to be the last kid in the last row.
