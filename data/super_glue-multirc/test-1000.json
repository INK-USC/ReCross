Force can cause an object at rest to start moving. Forces can cause objects to speed up or slow down. Forces can cause a moving object to stop. Forces can also cause a change in direction. In short, forces cause changes in motion. The moving object may change its speed, its direction, or both. We know that changes in motion require a force. We know that the size of the force determines the change in motion. How much an objects motion changes when a force is applied depends on two things. It depends on the strength of the force.

She wants to investigate the curious case of Sanjay Singhania , a notable city businessman , who is reported to have anterograde amnesia .  Her professor denies access to Sanjay's records as it is currently under criminal investigation .  Sunita , nonetheless , decides to investigate the matter herself .  Sanjay is introduced as he brutally murders a man .  He takes a Polaroid picture of the man , and writes on it `` done '' .  It is revealed that Sanjay has anterograde amnesia where he loses his memory every 15 minutes .  Sanjay uses a system of photographs , notes , and tattoos on his body to recover his memory after each cycle .  It is revealed that Sanjay is ultimately out to avenge the death of his sweetheart Kalpana , and that he is systematically killing the people who were responsible for it .  His main target is `` Ghajini '' , a notable social personality in the city .  Police Inspector Arjun Yadav , on the case of the serial murders , tracks Sanjay down to his flat and attacks and disables him .  Yadav finds two diaries where Sanjay has chronicled the events of 2005 and 2006 .  The film flashes back to 2005 as Yadav reads the diary .  Sanjay Singhania is shown as the owner of the Air Voice mobile telephone company .  In the course of his business , Sanjay sends his men to meet Kalpana , a struggling model , about putting up a billboard above her apartment .  The owner of Kalpana's advertising firm misinterprets this as a romantic advance , and in view of a possible lucrative Air Voice ad campaign and other benefits , encourages Kalpana to accept the overture .",

        "The film opens with Sunita , a medical student , and her friends working on a project about the human brain .  She wants to investigate the curious case of Sanjay Singhania , a notable city businessman , who is reported to have anterograde amnesia .  Her professor denies access to Sanjay's records as it is currently under criminal investigation .  Sunita , nonetheless , decides to investigate the matter herself .  Sanjay is introduced as he brutally murders a man .  He takes a Polaroid picture of the man , and writes on it `` done '' .  It is revealed that Sanjay has anterograde amnesia where he loses his memory every 15 minutes .

Police Inspector Arjun Yadav , on the case of the serial murders , tracks Sanjay down to his flat and attacks and disables him .  Yadav finds two diaries where Sanjay has chronicled the events of 2005 and 2006 .  The film flashes back to 2005 as Yadav reads the diary .

In the course of his business , Sanjay sends his men to meet Kalpana , a struggling model , about putting up a billboard above her apartment .  The owner of Kalpana's advertising firm misinterprets this as a romantic advance , and in view of a possible lucrative Air Voice ad campaign and other benefits , encourages Kalpana to accept the overture . \nQuestion: Who denies Sunita access to Sanjay's records, who is reported to have anterograde amnesia, because they are under criminal investigation?\n\nI am grading my students' exercises.

        "In 1863, Alexander II re-convened the Diet of Finland and initiated several reforms increasing Finland's autonomy from Russia including establishment of its own currency, the markka. Liberation of business led to increased foreign investment and industrial development. Finland also got its first railways, separately established under Finnish administration. Finally, the elevation of Finnish from a language of the common people to a national language equal to Swedish opened opportunities for a larger proportion of the society. Alexander II is still regarded as \"The Good Tsar\" in Finland. These reforms could be seen as results of a genuine belief that reforms were easier to test in an underpopulated, homogeneous country, than in the whole of Russia.

        "(CNN) -- Ralph Mata was an internal affairs lieutenant for the Miami-Dade Police Department, working in the division that investigates allegations of wrongdoing by cops. Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. \nQuestion: \"The Milk Man,\" as he is also known, is alleged to have paid two assailants to kill who?\n\nI am grading my students' exercises.

General Wheaton, commanding the district of the Lakes, ordered the concentration of troops from Camps Warner and Bidwell, while General Canby sent the forces under Colonel John Green and Major Mason from Ft. Vancouver to join the command under General Wheaton. As soon as the settlers could fort up for mutual protection, the entire forces of regulars and volunteers were concentrated at Van Bremer's ranch west of the lava beds under General Wheaton and at Land's ranch on the east side of Tule Lake and directly north of the stronghold. Such was the disposition of the forces when I arrived at headquarters at Van Bremer's ranch. By orders of Governor Grover of Oregon the volunteers under Captains O. C. Applegate and Kelley were placed under the command of General Wheaton. The two companies numbered about 225 men, and were commanded by General John E. Ross, a veteran Indian fighter, but too old to withstand the hardships of a winter campaign against Indians. The men were all poorly provided with clothing and bedding, most all having taken only what they could strap behind their saddles, but in spite of this and a temperature often below zero, no murmur was heard, and all anxiously, eagerly looked forward to a meeting with the brutal savage murderers of their fellow citizens.

He did not understand the boy's peculiar and erratic nature, and was particularly displeased when he found that Edgar had run into debt at college. There was an angry scene between the two, and Edgar was told that he must leave the university and go into the counting-room. It appears that he made some attempt to tie himself down to figures and accounts and business routine; but as he had not been brought up to this kind of life, he soon tired of it, and decided to go into the world to seek his own fortune. He went to Boston, where he published a volume of poetry. In the preface to this volume, Poe says that the poems were written before he was fourteen. Though this may not be strictly true, there is little doubt that some of them were. While he was still at school he had collected enough of his poems to make a volume, and Mr. Allan had taken them up to the master of the English and Classical School to get his advice about publishing them.
