The match between Flagstaff Hill and Brighton in the Southern Football League, played earlier this month in Adelaide, saw the player dribble the oval shaped ball soccer-style into the goal.

        "(CNN) I'll never forget the day a US army veteran who had fought in Iraq embraced Islam at my former mosque in New Orleans. He arrived in his full uniform, and was overcome with emotion when he heard the congregation shout \"Allahu Akbar\" after he uttered the Islamic declaration of faith. The army veteran never thought that the words that had terrified him in Iraq would be the very same that would welcome him to his new faith. They are words that he now uses in prayer. Contrary to what many people seem to think, the words \"Allahu Akbar\" simply mean \"God is greater.\" It is a powerful declaration used by Muslims on many occasions and in many prayers. It is a celebration of life, the first words fathers whisper in the ears of their newborns. They are used to indicate gratitude when God bestows something upon you that you would have been incapable of attaining were it not for divine benevolence. It is a prayerful phrase that reminds us that, no matter what our concerns may be, God is greater than them.\n@highlight\nThe phrase \"Allahu Akbar,\" which means \"God is greater\" in Arabic, should be known as a celebration of life, not death and destruction, says Imam Omar Suleiman \nBut the way \"Allahu Akbar\" often appears in the media seems to serve a nefarious agenda: to instill fear of anyone who utters the phrase and to raise concerns even about @placeholder itself. \nWhat could the \"@placeholder\" be?

Erie, Pennsylvania, experienced the latter on Monday, when a total of 34 inches of snow fell on Christmas Day, blanketing the city and shattering the city's previous records for snowfall in a single day.

The snow didn't stop overnight, either. Erie picked up another 24.5 inches of snow on Tuesday, bringing the two-day tally to 58.5 inches.

        "Speaking prior to England's away friendly fixture against Republic of Ireland, ITV pundits Ian Wright and Paul Scholes disagreed on the issue of Jack Wilshere's position. Whereas Wright suggested that a quintessential holding role would 'be the best place for him in the future,' Scholes suggested that due to his creativity, he needs a player sitting behind him in the middle of the park. Former Arsenal striker, Wright, added that 23-year-old Wilshere no longer has the pace he once did as a teenager and will therefore continue to 'get into trouble' making marauding runs forward. Wilshere's best position has long been the subject of debate due to his fondness of roaming forward, while possessing a combative element to his game.\n@highlight\nIan Wright and Paul Scholes differed over Jack Wilshere's best position\n@highlight\nWright thinks he has lost pace and will therefore continue to 'get into trouble'\n@highlight\nScholes disagrees believing he still has the ability to beat players and could do with a player like Michael Carrick sitting behind him\n@highlight\nWilshere was praised by Scholes and Lee Dixon after England's 0-0 friendly draw at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin \nHowever, @placeholder believes that the days in which Wilshere could glide past players on the merit of his pace are behind him. \nCan you figure out what does the \"@placeholder\" mean?

The recent climate event -- characterized by warming waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean -- has been one of the strongest ever recorded, and its impact has been felt far and wide.

        [

The picture showed 40-year-old Joey and Indiana surrounded by toys, and the caption read; 'It's 60 and sunny outside today and even brighter inside.. Joey's out of bed teaching signs to Indy on the floor.' Late last month, Joey's husband Rory revealed in a letter to her friends and fans that his wife is no longer able to get out of bed, so it seems she has rallied slightly. It has been a big week for Joey, who is stage IV cervical cancer, as she also learned on Monday that she and Rory had been nominated for a Grammy award for their song If I Needed You.\n@highlight\nJoey Feek, 40, who is terminally ill with stage IV cervical cancer, was able to get out of bed and play with her daughter Indiana on Friday\n@highlight\nLate last month, Joey's husband Rory said in a letter to her friends and fans that his wife was bedridden and no longer able to get up\n@highlight\nJoey and Rory learned earlier this week that they had been nominated for a Grammy award for their song If I Needed You\n@highlight\nJoey said her one wish is to make it to daughter Indiana's second birthday in February\n@highlight\nThe country star was released from hospital in October so she could spend more time with Indiana and say goodbye to her stepdaughters\n'We're going to sleep tonight remembering the morning we welcomed (@placeholder) into the world.\n\nI am trying to decide what \"@placeholder\" means in the previous text.\nHelp by choosing an option between:\n- Grammy\n- IV\n- Indiana\n- Indy\n- Joey\n- Joey Feek\n- Rory",

'If you give a woman, or a man for that matter, without his or her knowledge, a drug and then have sex with that person without consent, that's rape,' the president said.\n@highlight\nObama was answering questions about his Iran nuclear bargain when a reporter asked if Cosby's Presidential Medal of Freedom would be yanked\n@highlight\nHe said there's 'no mechanism' for revoking the 2002 prize but what the comedian is accused of doing to dozens of women is 'rape'\n@highlight\n'If you give a woman, or a man for that matter, without his or her knowledge, a drug and then have sex with that person without consent, that's rape,' the president said\n@highlight\n'And I think this country, any civilized country, should have no tolerance for rape'\n@highlight\nLawyer Gloria Allred who is representing victims says that White House must come up with way of revoking it \n'In my opinion, allegations against Mr Cosby by more than 40 women alleging that he drugged and sexually assaulted them are so serious that it is the right time to create a mechanism and establish the precedent to revoke this honor to Mr @placeholder. \nWhat could the \"@placeholder\" be?

Now Al-Sibai, a \u2018key influencer\u2019 of the group behind the Tunisian beach massacre, could have his handouts from the taxpayer slashed after the Mail took these photographs casting doubt on his claim to be severely disabled. Al-Sibai, who has fought deportation from the UK for more than a decade, insists he is too unwell to work, cannot walk without severe discomfort and requires help with basic care, such as washing, dressing and using the toilet.\n\n\nSummary:\n\n- \nHani Al-Sibai says he has 'severe mobility problems' to get disability cash\n\n- \nBut Al-Sibai was captured on camera by the Mail casting doubt on his claim\n\n- \nHate preacher has fought deportation from the UK for more than a decade\n\n- \nThought to be a 'key influencer' behind the Tunisian beach massacre",

        "Washington (CNN) Americans views of Obamacare tilt narrowly positive, according to a new CNN/ORC poll, marking the first time more have favored than opposed the law since its passage in 2010. The shift comes at the same time more than 8-in-10 say the law is likely to be repealed and replaced by incoming president Donald Trump. Overall, 49% say they favor the 2010 health care law, more formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, while 47% oppose it. Though a mostly mixed review overall, that's a sharp improvement compared with previous polling on the law. More have opposed than favored the law in every CNN/ORC poll on this question from March 2010 until now. The shift in the law's favor stems largely from Democrats and independents, while views among Republicans haven't moved much.\n@highlight\n49% say they favor the 2010 health care law\n@highlight\nBut few feel the ACA has done much to help them personally \nThat's an uptick since 2015, but nearly all of the increase in perceptions of the law as a success comes among @placeholder, 46% of whom say so now, up from 19% in 2015. \nCan you figure out what does the \"@placeholder\" mean?

Rodriguez, 40, was signed by the network to comment on the Major League Baseball playoffs, but was chatting with its NFL studio team when he was asked to toss a football to journalist Jay Glazer. The pass sailed above the diminutive Glazer's head and smashed into a video display behind him, cracking a television screen as the show's regular analysts broke out in a chorus of 'oooohs'.\n@highlight\nRodriguez hired by Fox network to provide analysis for MLB playoffs\n@highlight\nThird baseman appeared on football pre-game show to chat with hosts\n@highlight\nFormer quarterback attempted pass, but it flew over receiver's head\n@highlight\nFootball smashed into video display at end of show's set, breaking TV \nHowever, Rodriguez reminded them that his gridiron days were 'more than twenty years ago' before letting loose the pass across the @placeholder set. \nWhat could the \"@placeholder\" be?

More powerful and more deadly than heroin, fentanyl has sparked a new set of survival rules among people who abuse opioids. About 75 percent of the state's men and women who died after an unintentional overdose last year had fentanyl in their system, up from 57 percent in 2015 (PDF). It's a pattern cities and towns are seeing across the state and country, particularly in New England and some Rust Belt states. Fentanyl may be especially lethal because it's strong, it's mixed with other drugs in varying amounts unknown to the user, and it can trigger an overdose within seconds. \"It happens so fast, like instantly, as soon as you do the shot,\" said Allyson, a 37-year-old woman who started using heroin in her late teens.\n\n\nNow that you've read the article, please write a new sentence to add to it.",
