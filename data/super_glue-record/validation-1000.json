Mission apparently accomplished: Fox is the most-watched cable news network, and yet, some surveys suggest that people who rely on Fox as their primary information source know less about current events than people who watch no news at all. But to jab at Fox for inaccuracy is to miss Fox's purpose. Fox has created an information community. We used to say, \"Everybody's entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.\" In a mass media age, what counted as \"fact\" was defined by a few great national institutions: a small group of prestigious newspapers, a pair of leading news magazines, a trio of television broadcasters.\n\n\nNow that you've read the article, please write a new sentence to add to it.",

        "(CNN) -- At the Group of 20 summit in Mexico, President Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin had their first face-to-face meeting since Putin resumed the Russian presidency in May. The joint statement they issued afterward indicated several issues (including Iran and Syria) that the two sides would seek to cooperate on, but it did not announce any significant agreements to do so. More telling were the visual images when the two presidents were together; Obama appeared to be doing his best to project an image of warmth and friendliness, while Putin was stiff and reserved, as he usually is with other world leaders.

On Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that one of the two ships was found. \"I am delighted to announce that this year's Victoria Strait Expedition has solved one of Canada's greatest mysteries, with the discovery of one of the two ships belonging to the Franklin Expedition lost in 1846,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\nSummary:\n\n- \nBritish sailor John Franklin hoped to sail the Northwest Passage in the 1840s\n\n- \nFranklin and his crew perished in the Canadian Arctic\n\n- \nThe Canadian government said one of the two missing ships has been found",

It could turn out to be a model for the United States to follow -- or a prime example of what not to do in the wake of a severe recession. After forming a government in the wake of the May election, the ruling coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats announced plans last month to cut spending and raise taxes in an effort to reduce the budget deficit. Zakaria, the author and host of CNN's \"Fareed Zakaria GPS\" spoke to CNN on Wednesday from London. Here is an edited transcript:\n\n- \nBritain's aggressive plan to cut its deficit is a bold but risky move, says Fareed Zakaria\n\n- \nThe coalition government has announced plans but they haven't gone into effect, he says\n\n- \nZakaria: Question is will it restore business confidence or cause recession\n\n- \nHe says GOP should take note of how Cameron is modernizing the Conservative Party",

        "(CNN) -- Tibetans have long occupied a special place in the heart of the West. But that has not done them very much good. Over the past year, as the world focused on the Arab uprisings, and as China's growth shadowed over a weak global economy, the Tibetan struggle for autonomy entered a disturbing phase. From a distance, it might have looked as if China thoroughly succeeded in crushing Tibet's hope. But at home, in a western part of China, Tibetans are giving notice that their struggle is not over. Chinese authorities would do well to reconsider their strong-arm approach, because with or without Western attention, the Tibetans will continue their fight.\n\n\nSummary:\n\n- \nSince March 2011, 30 Tibetans have set themselves on fire in protest of China\n\n- \nFrida Ghitis: Beijing blames the horrific practice on the Dalai Lama, but he urges nonviolence\n\n- \nGhitis: Dalai Lama is popular in the West, but heads of state can't do much to help Tibet\n\n- \nGhitis: Unless China changes its polices toward Tibetans, it will only see more unrest",

In that sense, a Florida jury's recent verdicts -- and nonverdicts -- against Michael Dunn demonstrate a fundamental truth about trials. They are not only unpredictable; they are designed that way. The case against Dunn stemmed from an incident on November 23, 2012. Dunn, a 47-year-old white man, arrived at a gas station in Jacksonville, Florida, and parked next to an SUV that contained Davis and other black teenagers. When Dunn complained about loud music coming from the SUV, words were exchanged and Dunn ultimately fired a gun that killed Davis.

Geithner's guidelines would apply to companies receiving assistance from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.

The news has caused a big uproar in Western Europe, with Merkel demanding a response from Washington. It was \"incredible that an allied country like the United States and at this point goes as far as spying on private communications that have no strategic justification,\" said Jean-Marc Ayrault, the Prime Minister of France. \"Trust needs to be rebuilt,\" Merkel said. While observers warn these complaints are hypocritical and have more to do with domestic politics in Western Europe than true feelings about the United States, this incident is nonetheless much more than a mere blip in the time line of Obama's presidency.

        "(CNN) -- This year has provided something of a bumper crop of Catholic candidates. Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich in the Republican primaries, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan in the general election. Given the endless cycle of sin and guilt that we have to live with, sometimes it feels like it's easier for a Catholic to get elected president than it is to get into heaven. But political strength doesn't necessarily mean political unity. Today's Catholic vote is divided by intensity of faith. According to Gallup, the \"very religious\" lean toward Romney and the \"nonreligious\" prefer Obama, by significant margins. This reflects an internal story of conflict between liberal and conservative perspectives on what it means to be a Catholic. Biden and Ryan stand on either side of that debate, and their selections as running mates signal vastly different approaches to winning the Catholic vote.\n@highlight\nTim Stanley: The VP candidates reflect divide between liberal and conservative Catholicism\n@highlight\nHe says Biden is a post-Vatican II Catholic aimed at social justice and accessible faith\n@highlight\nHe says Ryan hews to traditional Catholicism; record is anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage\n@highlight\nStanley: Ryan will have to show social compassion with fiscal conservatism\nWhereas Biden meets privately with nuns and emphasizes a private faithfulness, Ryan puts his @placeholder right out in the open -- and he attracts some evangelical support for doing it.\n\nPick one option, \"@placeholder\" refers to:\n- Biden\n- CNN\n- Catholic\n- Catholicism\n- Gallup\n- Joe Biden\n- Newt Gingrich\n- Obama\n- Paul Ryan\n- Republican\n- Rick Santorum\n- Romney\n- Ryan\n- Stanley\n- Tim Stanley\n- post-Vatican II Catholic",

        "Summary:\n\n- \nControversy over adult content on mobile apps highlights control over free speech\n\n- \nApple has banned some apps from its store because of sexual images\n\n- \nTech titans may have more power over Internet free speech than some governments\n\n- \nApple promises a mobile experience free from porn and other irritants \n\nArticle:\n\n(CNN) -- It's been framed as a debate between Web freedom and the freedom from stumbling upon potentially offensive content. In recent weeks, several companies have been forced to grapple with sexually explicit images appearing in their popular mobile apps. Such images, a small fraction of the apps' user-generated content, place these companies at risk for being banned from portals such as Apple's App Store, where millions of people gain access to the mobile Web. But some observers see something more at play here. \"In this debate, some may focus on freedom and others may focus on the harm of adult content, but what's really happening here is the crystallization of the power of platform providers -- Apple, Google, Microsoft and even Amazon,\" said James McQuivey, a tech-industry analyst at Forrester Research.",

As the President put it Wednesday, \"Just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail.\" The Obama Doctrine, as outlined by the President at the commencement ceremony at West Point, can be summarized as limiting the use of American power to defending the nation's core interests and being smart enough to avoid the temptation to use such power when it embroils the country in costly mistakes such as the decision to invade Iraq. Obama was attempting to answer a central question: What strategic doctrine should guide U.S. actions in a world where America's long war against core al Qaeda and its Taliban allies is winding down, at the same time that Russia and China are both flexing their muscles and when a number of al Qaeda affiliates in countries such as Syria are enjoying something of a resurgence?\n@highlight\nPresident Obama outlines his version of the Kennan, Bush and Powell doctrines\n@highlight\nPeter Bergen says it amounts to a \"do no harm\" view of foreign policy\n@highlight\nIt represents a dramatic switch from counterproductive cases of U.S. overreach, he says\n@highlight\nBergen: Obama Doctrine lacks drama but may be a smart way for superpower to behave \nBut after that it also became the basis for the unnecessary and costly war against the @placeholder dictator. \nCan you figure out what does the \"@placeholder\" mean?

        "Article:\n\nIn his zeal to promote nuclear power, filmmaker Robert Stone inserted numerous half-truths and less-than-half-truths in his new documentary \"Pandora's Promise,\" which CNN is airing on November 7. One of Stone's more misleading allegations was that scientists at a U.S. research facility, the Argonne National Laboratory, were on the verge of developing a breakthrough technology that could solve nuclear power's numerous problems when the Clinton administration and its allies in Congress shut the program in 1994 for purely political reasons. Like the story of Pandora itself, the tale of the integral fast reactor (IFR) -- or at least the version presented in the movie -- is more myth than reality. In the final assessment, the concept's drawbacks greatly outweighed its advantages. The government had sound reasons to stanch the flow of taxpayer dollars to a costly, flawed project that also was undermining U.S. efforts to reduce the risks of nuclear terrorism and proliferation around the world.\n\n\nHighlights:\n\n- \nScientist: \"Pandora's Promise\" offers \"half-truths\" promoting integral fast reactors\n\n- \nGovernment: IFRs cut \"barriers to theft, misuse\" of plutonium, which is used for weapons\n\n- \nFilm falsely says IFRs can't melt down, says Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists",

First Up: Community College Plan AZUZ: First up -- McDonald's and Gap -- they're two of the businesses that are getting involved in a new education plan by President Obama. It's called \"Skills for America's Future.\" And its purpose, according to the president, is to link up community college students with the businesses that could hire them. So one part of this, for example: Gap, the clothing business, says it plans to start offering community college students the chance to build their skills and possibly get jobs down the road. While talking about this, the president, who's a Democrat, spoke out against Republicans, saying they are trying to cut education from the government's budget by 20 percent, in order to save money. A Republican representative says it's President Obama's government spending that threatens education by creating debt that today's students will have to pay for.\n@highlight\nHear why some say that World War I actually ended last Sunday\n@highlight\nDiscover what scientists have learned about marine biodiversity\n@highlight\nWeigh in on a plan to put ads on school notices\n@highlight\nUse the Daily Discussion to help students understand today's featured news stories \nAnd it took up the job of paying back what it still owed from @placeholder \n\nYou should decide what \"@placeholder\" is referring to.

        "(CNN) -- As the world watched and waited for little Prince George to make his royal way into the world in London, Queen Elizabeth II was among those wishing the baby would hurry up. The reason? \"I'm going on holiday,\" the queen said days before the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to the future king on July 22. Thankfully, Prince George was born just in time for the queen to begin her official holiday last week at the royal family's Scottish retreat, Balmoral Castle. The queen and members of the royal family will spend the next two months at her 50,000-acre estate in the Scottish highlands. The castle was originally built by Queen Victoria and by all accounts of both historians and those who work on the estate, it holds a very special place in the queen's heart. That's likely because it offers her a level of privacy that she cannot find anywhere else.\n\n\nSummary:\n\n- \nCottages on the grounds of Balmoral Castle are available to the public for rent\n\n- \nThe royal estate in the Scottish highlands is a favorite retreat of Queen Elizabeth II\n\n- \nSightings of the royal family are possible for visitors to the estate\n\n- \nThe cozy cottages are more rustic than the royal digs",
