Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied?\nTitle: Good Album\nReview: The Velvet Crush rock a bit harder and faster on this live album. Is it because power pop giant Tommy Keene is sitting in on guitar ? Don't know. This is a fun album that catches a great power pop band playing smoking versions of some of their best songs. Great live sound production too -- no pro-tool enhancement, or computer corrected vocals. Buy this album. Pick up all of Tommy Keene's albums too (his live album is a great start).",

I love all the great directors- Spielberg, Hitchcock, Wilder, Kubrick, Landis, Scorsese, etc. etc.\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\" was one, if not the most tedious films, I have ever had to endure. Why is it so talked about is beyond me unless, there is nothing definable to discuss. The scenery was bland, dialogue uninteresting and unengaging, even the shots were dull.It's the first film I ever returned to Amazon...ever.When I took Cinema History in College, the Professors I had kept talking about this film as a \"must see/ will change your life\" sort of thing. Curious, as we never saw it in class (must have been the explicit erotic nature it has at times). Now I think they wanted the girls in the class to see it on their own, because they may have wanted to discuss it with them personally after the class was dismissed, if you catch my drift.I would pass on this one-big time.\nIs this product review negative?",

If you're wondering how each season can just keep getting better and better, join the crowd. Each episode in season 3 is absolutely mesmerizing. The razor-sharp humor is there, of course, but wait until you see Jimmy Smits play Miguel Prado. You simply won't believe how amazing he is. The action is gripping, explosive, etc., etc. I know I'm gushing, but it is so very deserving of the highest rating I can give it. After watching season 3, you won't be able to deny that Dexter rocks! The entire ensemble of actors, Michael C. Hall, especially, deserve accolade after accolade. You guys deliver!",

In this one, we get another one. It's a twist I found extremely disapointing and unnecessary. (But of course... it was put in to say there will be another one...)What made the first movie so great? It didn't follow a formula. What made this one bad? It follows a formula.Whereas the first one did so much with so little, this one does so little with so much.I can't honestly believe that they thought the movie was going to be better by simply multiplying the number of victims.What we get here is a bunch of pretty WB type faces, reacting overly dramatic, getting unexpectedly killed one by one. How original...Let's face it folks... it's been done before...This isn't Saw, this is Final Destination...How disapointing...\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

Whilst the LTTE is undoubtedly an international organisation, all its military activities are carried out in Sri Lanka.

The holes are pre-drilled, however at this time I am looking for another set of drawer handles because the holes missed the mark. The instructions are not very clear. One part is written in Japanese/Chinese(?). My husband and I managed to put the cabinet together in about 2 hours not counting the hour to figure out the instructions. Overall, on close inspection, the finished product looks like a cheaply put together cabinet vs a solid construction because the junctions are not a tight fit.I'd rate the cabinet a 5/5 for functionality, and because of the labor involved and trouble to look for matching drawer handles I'd pay $50.00 for this cabinet and rate it a 1/5 with a recommendation of \"Do not buy\" unless you are willing to overpay.\nAnswer:",

When I first bought the film I didn&#65533;t understand the film and didn't appreciate the acting or story line to it. But as I got older I knew that this was one of the best independent movies ever made. It is a great story about kids living in New York and showing there way of life through drugs, alcohol and sex.

Even if the inspiration for them is fairly obvious, Jordan does some impressive things with them, and with the reaction of the western \"wetlanders\" to their latest incursion.Other than that, this book has simply added to a series that is becoming top-heavy, and in danger of crushing itself under its own weight. Since of all of the characters in the book, it is Egwene who develops the most, I would rather have had Rand's tale wrapped up long ago, and had a (concurrent?) story about her instead.But no, the Last Battle is yet to come, and I'm sorry to say, the sooner the better\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

Worked great for about 2 months. more power, better gas milage, etc. then the capacitor in one of the wires went out. I don't know which wire, but one of the cylinders stopped working. I sent back all four wires to Nology for them to check out. They sent them back with the explanation that a metal connector was loose. I put the wires back on my car and they worked great,....for about two weeks. At a cost of $50 per wire I expected more. I have never had any spark plug wire fail except for Nology. You are better off trying Pulstar Pulse Plug. It has the capacitor in the plug itself. Nology wires look much \"cooler\", but I would rather have performance over looks.

There are definitely some unforgettable scenes here...I'm talking about the botched up marriage proposal of course, and who can forget the part where James Caan has to teach Grant how to talk like a gangster?!

Once again, the book reads like fiction and the reader has to keep reminding himself that the events and people are real. It begins with the Fenice Opera House burning to the ground. Wild accusations abound as the Venitians try to ascertain whether the fire was accident or arson. Fingers are pointed at everyone including top level government officials. Amidst the fire investigation, there are parties, business deals, crimes, and even murder/suicides for the socialites to discuss and share their individual viewpoints. The writing makes the people and the city come alive with culture and fun. At times it is difficult to keep all of the characters straight, but overall an original insight into the city and it's people.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

A group of 20s something were picked up one by one and slaughtered for their internal organs while vacationing in Brazil (wonder whether this movie is banned in Brazil for bad publicity of its tourism).Lead charactered is a brother and a sister (a rarity as flicks like this usually they are lovers - also check out Jeepers Creepers 1 as the main heroes are also brother and sister)Overall, the movie is well-paced, well-balanced between action, gore, humour and yes, SEX. The dvd itself is slighty disappointing. The 5.1 sound is OK but the picture transfer is too dark so it is hard to see what's going on the screen in the night scenes. There is also a good commentary by director John Stockwell.If you like Hostel, this one is no brainer but even if you don't like Hostel, you may still like this one as this is better than HOSTEL.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

I would frequently go out there and swat flies, and would count how many I swatted. When there were a lot of flies, I'd swat 40 or 50 in a single setting.Once we hung this up, I would go out there and swat 200 - 500 flies in a single setting.So it does kill flies, but it isn't worth it because it attracts thousands more than you already have.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

        "Is this product review positive?\nTitle: Excellent, accurate, and detailed\nReview: This incredible book is a gem. Filled with black and white illustrations from the period in question, the fashion plates, drawings, caricatures, and portraits help create a strong sense of the 19th century. This book follows the gradual changes and shows the overall shape of each chunk of time in the form of silhouettes (The author prefaces each section with a gray on white figure outlining the nature of that time's costume). While this book may be out of print, it is well worth the search if your passion is costume history through primary resources, particularly that of the 19th century. The approach is purely pictorial, but if what you want to know is the look, this book is excellent.\nAnswer:",

I had a 100% every quarter with this text book. The reason why I deducted a point is that they don't always explain the harder problems. I personally think they shoudld make more different examples of problems. I have a great math teacher, so she explains stuff that I am not quite sure. But this book should be used only by advanced and intermidiates math students. This book moves with a fast past and it uses a lot of difficult math terms for special eds. I that because of my friend and I know their pace. [...]. A great source for step-by-step solution incase anyone don't know what it is. My school purchased the account and it is a great accomidation to this book. I am an eight grader in advance math, my class went through the whole book!!!

Min's a sensible girl with cheeky taste in shoes, and she's met her match in Cal Morrisey, who's hot enough to melt the cherries on her shoes.After being dumped, Min's in a man-hating state of mind the night she overhears her ex bet Cal that Cal won't be able to get \"frigid\" chubby Min into bed within a month, and is too furious to hang around and listen to the outcome. So when Cal approaches her a few minutes later, she can only assume the worst.Horrible families, ten-dollar bets, and over-protective friends aren't enough to fight the fates that seem to want Cal and Min together. Bet Me is a wonderfully light and enjoyable read. If I had a rating system, this one would get top marks!\nAnswer:",

        "Is this product review positive?\nTitle: Minor corrections\nReview: For anyone who is interested in reading the graphic novels of this movie after watching it, which I highly recommend, the three books are \"Sin City\", \"The Big, Fat Kill\" and \"That Yellow Bastard\". As a fan who has read all three of those stories many, many times, I simply felt that the proper titles should have been given, since the editorial review, and another review mixed up the titles. Marv was in \"Sin City\", Hartigan was in \"That Yellow Bastard\" and Dwight was from \"The Big, Fat Kill\". Unfortunately, this was not a direct translation, and as always, the books are far better. I look forward to the director's cut to see if some of my favorite lines that were absent make it in. At which point the movie will reach five stars.\nAnswer:",

        "Based on this review, would the user recommend this product?\n===\nReview: Tis book kick-started the fields of phonology and linguistics, but it is long since obsolete. It's a work that is based on intuition, and the field has moved on to experimental techniques. Rather, I should say that experimental fields have grown up, like Psycholinguistics and Computational Linguistics, but linguists in Chomsky's tradition have largely ignored them.It's a work that describes English, but gives the impression that it is providing deep explanations of English. For instance, it popularized the idea of a \"feature\" as a basic, atomic entity in linguistics. But, 50 years on, features have led to many publications but few insights that have proved themselves useful outside the tightly knit community that uses them. Speech technology, for instance, never found features to be particularly useful.It's a Bible among a certain class of linguists, but it's not clear whether it has actually led to much.\nAnswer:",

When we bought our little place on the coast we decided a smaller windchime was needed. We searched and found this set. These are different, they are smaller yet sound great no tinny tinkling in the breeze we get a melodic and peaceful sound that seems to enhance the sound of the surf.

Every chapter eases into Roman history in a way that brings a beginner up to speed and new insights into America itself. Barr includes extensive footnotes and uses direct quotes from the great Roman historians, playwrights and philosophers whenever possible. The transition from Republican rule to the Empire is clearly described- again, in a way that offers insight in to modern America. Through good emperors and bad, remembering senators corrupt and enlightened, a picture of Rome's historical flaw becomes apparant not in the form of government that it possesed at any given point in time, but the values of their culture and how they changed. If you are interested in Roman history, get this book.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

But this IS the corkscrew you want to have with you when you travel. The open screw design means you can safely open old, dry corks without fear of breaking the cork off in the bottle. The foil cutter works well, even on those plastic bottle toppers. This corkscrew does require some practive, however, as you need to line up the screw correctly -- not in the center of the cork but more towards the edge, about halfway between center and edge. On one end is a tiny flip-out blade that can be used for cutting off the foil capsule. On the other end is a lever that serves as a brace that rests on the edge of the bottle to give you leverage when extracting the cork. This makes it easy to open a bottle of wine without setting it down on a tabletop.\nIs this product review negative?",

I started to read it when it first came out, in the 80s, and again recently, and I just didn't enjoy it. It reminds me of PBS specials where some Harvard-educated musicologist ventures into the swamplands to interview old bluesmen, and tell us all the deep socio-economic underpinnings of the lyrics. Forget it. It's just the blues - it's meant to be felt in your bones, not theorized about. \"Blue Highways\" gave me the same feeling. W.L.H.Moon comes off as self-centered and condescending; he seems to secretly pity those he meets, even as he wants us to chuckle knowingly at them.

The details of this novel are very specific and to the point. It does not seem like Hemingway used any special techniques to try to attract the reader even more towards the novel. However, the novel was still enticing, and clear; unlike other authors, Hemingway did not keep me bewildered throughout the whole novel, and then surprised me with a bad conclusion-it was the opposite of that. I liked that Hemingway used various themes like courage, loneliness, defeat, and others. I also liked that Hemingway used very detailed descriptions of everything he talked about, and he used very simple language, comprehendible to everybody.

I've read the reviews about how reliable the player is, that it doesn't freeze up like windows computers do. Guess mine is the exception that makes the rule. I have the IPOD for Windows and it freezes up all the time. When I use it for long walks at a brisk pace, I'm constantly having to reset. On today's 1 1/2 walk, it froze up on me 4 times.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product?\nReview title: The Giver Review- JD Bellingham High School\nProduct review: The Giver by Lois Lowry is a thoughtful, interesting book. Lois Lowry writes about a controlled society and a boy finding his way through life in that community. The book raises issues concerning constant control and makes the reader consider everything they take for granted in their daily lives. The book itself ends with the reader still questioning how Jonas' life ends. Personally, I liked The Giver for the questions it raised and how it made me actually think about what life could be like. The only thing I found that it should have more of was adventure or some excitement. It was a very thoughtful book, and not a book to read just for entertainment purposes.",

        "Is this product review positive?\nTitle: The Anger Workbook--- personal review\nReview: I purchased this book quite a few years ago. That was the beginning of learning to control my anger. Note I use the word control, not eliminate my anger. I finally learned why I get angry and react the way I do. I learned anger is not a bad thing--it's just the way you express it that can cause you such hardship. I really appreciate the Christian perspective this book offers. It has blessed me to use the information in this book. It has been about 6 years since I read the book and I can honestly tell you the information, counseling, and techniques really have worked. I highly recommend this book for anyone struggling with anger. There is hope to learn about it, understand why you do it, thus having control of it rather than it having control of you.\nAnswer:",

Her girl-next-door sexiness and quirky sense of humor make her characters lovable and relatable. Lola Versus is a fun film about a young woman in the big city facing the tribulations of love, sex, and life in general. It's an honest and heartfelt film that is as fun as it is emotional. The Blu-ray looks fantastic as well.Source: criticnic.com 3-October-2012Disclosure: Film sent by 20th Century Fox",

After reading my review several times I realized this wasn't a \"bad\" album, it's just that it sold a lot more copies than I thought it would. I just don't understand why Bon Jovi has remaind so popular while other bands like Dokken and Ratt have not enjoyed that level of success. Was Bon Jovi that much different than Ratt or Dokken? Of course not! Those three bands first appeared during the '80s and pretty much recorded the same kind of music (hard rock). Although this album does contain some of Bon Jovi's best tunes (Wanted Dead or Alive and You Give Love a Bad Name) those songs are really no better than Dokken's In My Dreams or Ratt's Round and Round. Ratt and Dokken may have rocked a little \"harder\" than Bon Jovi, but if you compare this album to Ratt's Out Of The Cellar or Dokken's Under Lock And Key I feel the Ratt and Dokken albums are much stronger and contain better songs.",

The author is obviously an amateur, and would do very well in a high school English class. However, his home-school background shows through the flaking veneer of this unrelatable book. His sentence structure is amazingly halted, unable to flow like a quality piece of literature. Making my attempt to read this book all the less enjoyable is the author's precocious vocabulary, needless proper names and jargon, and endless simile and metaphor that fills the pages. This book is less than the quality literature that I would expect from Knoph Publishers and is merely a lengthy oddity, not an odyssey, written by a young but hardly gifted author.Robert Goodhue Woodruff\nIs this product review negative?",

Thankfully I knew to just put the cover on and shut it off and let it burn itself off or I could have burned my face off! Part of the reason is I have a large family so the aluminum foil like pan lining the bottom of the grill had some gunk on it. I knew it had to be cleaned, but I thought I'd get three meals out of the grill before having to dismantle it and clean it. I bucked the system and bought another gas grill instead. In my condo complex we are not supposed to have gas grills on the deck, so I'll have to move it. Ironic because in all the YEARS of cooking on gas grills, the food has never caught fire like in the charbroil grill. I think it would be a good grill for a smaller family with someone who doesn't mind taking it apart and cleaning the aluminum foil like bowl like liner on the bottom of the unit. But a few of these to keep on hand because you will need them. They are flimsy. Good luck!\nAnswer:",

Not in the class with The Killer, or Hard Boiled, but carrying the expected Woo storyline about a not-so-bad bad-guy (pair of them, actually), and the bad things that happen to them. Certainly recommended for fans of Hong Kong action movies, and required viewing for Woo fans\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Mona Lisa and Heart As Big As Liverpool are stand-out tracks, each one packing gigantic emotional clout. Wylie's lyrics are of the simple, heartfelt kind. The music takes rock orchestration through a Phil Spector filter and is loaded with sharp, new wave attack and panache. Comparison with stalwarts of English rock music such as Bolan, Bowie and Ferry are apt and although Pete Wylie's songs don't cover the more avant-garde territory plied by those masters, he adds a drop of Motown and a touch of Bacharach for good measure. This album stands as fitting testament to Liverpool's most wayward genius.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

I'm very excited at the way this book sets about teaching me an amazing new skill... to be able to design physical objects from scratch to the point of producing drawings for a machine shop or injection molder. I just came here to order another copy for my son... I have 4 other Solidworks books also - but I'm a complete beginner and I'm not touching them until I finish this one. It's absolutely focused on teaching Solidworks in a systematic - \"bs free\" method. For those who complain about the pizza cutter - please - get a life. Also, the book points you to it's website to download a detailed update (18 pages) covering mostly cosmetic differences (dialog boxes) in the latest Solidworks version ...

And the perspective he gives on two commentary tracks gives insight into the thoughts and feelings human nature puts on display. I work as a paramedic in a rather large south florida community, and meet briefly with large numbers of people inside a week. I can attest to how people interact with one another without understanding why. Ball does an excellent job in capturing that. And the fact that he gives credit to those around him concerning the development and layers of the lives of the Fisher family and those who orbit their existence, in capturing a unique window into what it is like to have flaws, shows how great a film maker he is. He shows that we try and make the best of what we own the most...our lives. Thanks Alan.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

Regularly named as one of the ten best movie scores of all time, it's hard to imagine that it lost the Oscar in 1958 for Best Score to \"The Old Man and the Sea!\" Who remembers the music to THAT??????Peck and Heston are in their primes here, and Heston courageously took a role that didn't make him heroic every minute..a much more complex and conflicted character than most he has played. Gregory Peck's style and grace were never more evident than in this role.For 1958, the female roles in this movie were ahead of their time. Their roles drive the story, they are not just ornamentation along with the big skies and canyons.But again, the star of this movie is the incredible score.

With the starting grand entrance of Pitt to the predictable ending of Pitt saving the human race. (Yes, Again.)What makes this book highly interesting is Cussler's theory on the people of 'Atlantis', what happened to them, and the legacy that was left behind. Cussler was able to tie in the crash of a comet, the disappearance of Atlantis, a vehicle built by Adm. Byrd, and the rise of the Fourth Empire (Reich).The ending by Cussler leaves the book open for sequels, with the start of a new NUMA book, (serpent) and the hints given in the book, one wonders if this might be the last of the Pitt novels. Overall, the book is predictable as a James Bond movie. The bad dudes gets what they deserves, hero gets a few scraps and bruises, but saves the world and gets the girl. But the theories and knowledge of the ocean and historical tie-ins are worth the time invested in this book.\nAnswer:",

        "Title: The night THEY cashed in!\nProduct review: OK, I LOVE Halloween, it remains to this day as one of my favorite movies to date. I have both the 1978 and 2007 versions. I have the latest DVD of the 1978 version, and I am happy enough with that one as it is. But this set it $70 for something you already own as well as not H2 but 4 and 5. C'mon, Mr. Carpenter. I already own a DVD of your classic horror masterpiece, I DON'T NEED ANOTHER ONE. You're becoming just as bad as George Lucas and the Star Wars movies. Simply put, this doesn't bring ANYTHING new to the table. It's just another case of Anchor Bay going through the motions because it's time to make more $$$ again. Quite frankly, if you already own the movie, you don't need to buy this.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

I get inspired by looking at photos of existing gardens that someone actually created. Looking at paintings just doesn't do it for me. Besides, as the other reviewer said, these gardens are for zones all over the US, not necessarily for my zone, so not all the ideas work for me.The other thing that is missing in this book is at least a small photo of each of the plants/flowers on a page. Sure, I can look them up in another book. I'm familiar with quite a few of the flowers and their Latin/common names, but a beginning gardener wouldn't be. This is definitely not a book for beginners, and even as a more advanced gardener, it was disappointing.\nAnswer:",

Lastly, the holster flops out from my leg approximately one inch and there is no way to hold the holster tight against your thigh. All in all, a pooly made holster from a poor design.

Knocking down straw men is an easy pastime. The author's obvious point of view, with which I have a little sympathy, is totally negated by the charicatures he has created.

Interestingly tho, it advocates that we leave climate change alone given the huge cost of solving the problem. Bjorn recommends that efforts are instead focused on aid to places like Africa. He rightly claims that these issues can be dealt with less money. This does however ignore the fact that climate change will damage Africa by providing it with additional drought, heat and extreme weather conditions. A recent UK commons select committee report for example(HM Government, 2005) www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/environmental_audit_committee.cfm.suggests that our Africa efforts will be made obsolete by the effects of climate change. Bjion points out that Kyoto does not do enough to avoid climate change. I agree with this finding but believe that the recommendation should be to take a tougher line. To avoid the problem would be the wrong solution.\nIs this product review negative?",

It has a very raw, tough rock sound which reminds us of Blondie's punk roots. It sounds more rock and roll than the 1999 live cd. comparing to the latter, the following songs sound much better here : Hanging on the telephone, Rapture,X Offender, Dreaming,etc. However I have two things to complain about, what happened to atomic and maria?? If people actually requested the songs played in this concert, i am surprised that maria and atomic were not requested!and the Heart of glass version on this cd is very week comparing to the 1999 live cd.Other than that, this cd proves why Blondie is making it to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nAnswer:",

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied?\nTitle: Fantastic, raw and at times depressing................\nReview: This cd is all of the above and more to me. At first listening to this cd, I was frustrated that Lynne's voice continued to trail off into an almost inaudible whisper on various songs, and I also found myself uncomfortable with the confessional tone of many of the pieces. Upon many more listens I have grown to really love this cd. Her voice sounds very bluesy to me, and the writing on such songs as \"Thought it would be easier\" \"leaving\" and \"Why can't you be\" are first rate. Her voice is raw and perfect for the songs chosen, though I do have to strain to hear her in places. I do love this cd, but I do not listen to it as often as some of her others, because it can be depressing. Too depressing, but her talent was finally acknowledged as a result of this cd, and I'm glad the world took note.",

I admired his relentless pursuit of how the stock market actually worked and he finally figured it all out to make two million dollars. To create tremendous wealth you must concentrate on the best acting stocks in the market and use trailing stop loss orders.

Their stories interweave with one another and there are common themes of mental illness, lesbianism and unhappy women with death wishes. Not exactly light entertainment! There were times when I wanted to tell the main characters to snap out of it and get on with life rather than wallow in the melancholy and self-pity which they display.

This movie sucked! Bad! It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The story didn't make a lick of sense. You got these bad guys who kidnap a random woman whose husband turns out to be Rambo. The marine chases after these guys, killing them one by one. You'd think they'd just give him back his wife. She means nothing to them. Give her back and they can go on with their criminal business. But no. They hold on to her.The marine runs/jumps in slow motion away from explosions at least 4 times in this movie. This movie is filled with every single action movie clich\u00e9 and it didn't thrill in the slightest. It wasn't even bad enough to be good. It was just bad. It stunk.\nAnswer:",

There are a few moments were I wonder why it wasn't edited better. After the first 40 minutes the movie really picks up and it doesn't stop until the end.Quaid gives the performance of his career. Caviezel puts on an excellent show in his role. Andre Braugher gives an outstanding performance also. There were a few weak performances, but not many.It's a great story.

The sound quality is surprisingly good: when you hit a high note, you'll swear you can hear the hammer hitting the cord. If I have a complaint with this piano, it's that the included pedal isn't very responsive and will often fail to recognize that you are standing on it. Perhaps this is because I'm using it on carpet? In any case, the pedal was free, so I can't complain.First-time keyboard buyers should be aware that this does not come with speakers of any kind.

The twists in the plot are also engaging in that there are no clear trouble-free paths connecting the characters with their goals. Just like real life's various journeys during our teen years, \"Crooked\" offers no easy ride. The conclusion is well worth your time as well.

Please note you will need a dedicated SACD player to listen to the disc.Well - this certainly led me to believe that this was a SACD disc. Which, it is not. It's a standard CD and I am no happy at all. I would never have purchased this had I known this was not accurate.What a complete ripoff.EDIT - after a little more research, I guess, officially it is SACD. Come on. Claims to not play in standard player. Don't know about that. Clearly, this disc sounds inferior - even if it were standard CD, I'd be very disappointed. Again, I'm reviewing the sound quality, not the music. All of my \"real\" SACD are advanced resolution and as such generally have superior sound. If this is advanced resolution...... I'm not buying it. If you want this for superior SACD audio, then please, don't bother.\nIs this product review negative?",

I don't know what I was thinking giving it a second try.Using this product achieves a result similar to rubbing poison ivy on my face.I do have slightly sensitive skin, so maybe this could work for you. But really: if there is something in there that causes the skin on my neck & face to respond like that....is it really something that you want to be using?On the plus side: it lathers very nicely and the lavender scent is enjoyable but not overpowering.Finally, for the skeptics out there that are thinking \"hmm, maybe it is not the shaving cream but some other step in his routine that is causing the reaction\"...not the case. Today the only change to my routine was substituting in the T&F; shaving cream, and the result was painfully different from the norm.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

As I anxiously read the exciting words on the white pages, I was constantly distracted by the desparate use of poorly-chosen adjectives. After reading two large paragraphs, I could easily tell that the large book was poorly written by a hopelessly unskilled amature.\"Jean Auel had some great ideas for a story, but does not have the skills to tell it. The story might be interesting and well researched, but it is difficult to get past her awful prose which does nothing to paint a picture of a prehistoric time, and her amature use of adjectives is forever distracting from the story she's trying to tell.Please read the sample pages before buying this book.

In the beginning, it started of by giving some backround to the story and their beliefs of the community. Then as the story goes on it shows how the boy learns that there is more to what he was brought up to know to be true. Towards the end of the book, he becomes rebellious as he starts to realize the truth. The giver's job was to give the memories of life to the receiver who turned out to be Jonas our main character and with those he felt that everyone should have the memories that the giver has fed to him. The only part I did not like to well was the ending. It was sort of a cliff hanger.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

If you did buy this and like it but don't have any Mazzy Star, you should definitely go directly out and buy some.

The water pump at the one at our vacation home died within about 10 uses.I'm sending both units back and buying another brand.If they had worked properly, I'm not sure I would have like them even then. The design of this unit is \"odd\". I've had home espresso machines for 12 years and this one is just weird. If you remove the espresso coffee holder too soon after you brew, the grounds and steam explode all over. I also suspect that the thermostat is broken. It allows the water to boil--which does not make tasty coffee.Overall, I hate this unit.

After a pursuit of Max's ends in a fiery crash, killing the pursued (a biker named Nightrider), he is targeted by motor-terrorists for the death of their fellow gang member. When Max goes on a vacation trip with his wife and their infant son, they are attacked by the malicious, vengeful mob, leaving Max a childless widower hungry for his own violent revenge--and that's exactly what he gets. Set in post-apocalyptic Australia, this film, made for a meager $400,000, held the highest cost-profit ratio of any film in Hollywood history until 1999, when Blair Witch surpassed its mark.",

The 16 tracks show the lyrical power and solid musicianship that made each show a personal event for every fan.

They all work just fine until they get dirty and quit working. Apple, in their infinite wisdom and greed, made these so that they can't be cleaned without breaking into them and dealing with the incredibly intricate interior components, and then putting them back together with Super Glue. So when it happened this last time, I just went out to OfficeMax and bought a wired Logitech m110 for $17.11 (incl tax). It works just fine, plus is hugely cost effective, considering what Apple charges for their Mighty Mouse. This is the first time since 1984 that I've encountered an Apple product that sucks--I hope this isn't a trend.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Granted, there is room for other books than \"how to\" manuals, but I really hoped to come away from this book with at least a few ideas to try. It is a book about inventors after all.

(Why other manufacturers haven't figured out the design part is anybody's guess.) The problem with the Umbra rods -- all of them -- is NO tension. I have tried these repeatedly.... Why? Because my local hardware store carries them, and they are readily available elsewhere, and I have opted for form over function. Every single Umbra rod I have used fails drastically. They simply cannot bear any weight. Or, to put it differently, they cannot exert enough force against the surfaces they extend out to for them to bear any load. Worse, the springs that are the key element in sustaining the tension tend to fail. When those springs fail, anything you have suspended by the rod will come down. If it's a lightweight drapery panel, you may be in luck. Otherwise, forget about it.\nAnswer:",

Loved it, too, so I already had a good feeling about the Samsonite brand. The only complaint I have about this bag is that I cannot figure out a way to get my 66\" tripod in there!

Slow-moving at times for adults, I admired the filmmakers for deliberately crafting a wonderfully imagined movie that is never TOO scary or TOO loud or TOO disturbing for the youngest viewers in the audience. There are not enough of these movies today, the kind of movies that draw youngsters into the theatre to experience the joy of movie-going with an audience. The familial message is warmly relayed, and the movie's New York City is alternately delightfully whimsical and just scary enough in the nighttime Central Park scenes. The special effects simply amaze you, and the vocal antics of Nathan Lane will make you laugh out loud, regardless of your age.\nAnswer:",

I would never put another person through the torture of reading this long-winded dull attempt at a scandalous and exciting romance. Even though there is much symbolism to be found, when is one supposed to find it, while they are sleeping? Another factor of my displeasure with this book is that I love to read and now hesitate to pick up another Hawthorne piece. How did this book become a \"CLASSIC\"?\nAnswer:",

        "Title: Very good book\nProduct review: This book is a good one. When I first read it it was about a six on my scale of 1-10. But now I have started to realize that it is more of an eight. maybee nine. This book goes so much deeper than one can imagine, and when you think about it it really is a shock. A shock of how much the american dream has changed, and how friendship can be destroyed. This book does make you think of society and the hopes of reaching goals, it challenges and disturbes you as you read it (actually as you think of it). But overall this book is powerful and it plays on your emotions quite weel, so it is definately a good choice of reading.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

I can't say enough about how much I have enjoyed reading and now re-reading this series. I'm very saddened that we lost Mr. Jordan. His genius will be sorely missed. Keep reading the series, my friends, it's worth it!!!Book 6 is the first ebook version of the series I have read. I'm not real happy with the Kindle version of this book however. There are a HUGE number of typos and punctuation errors in it. I compared ebook six to the hardback book and the typos are not in the hardback version. Very poor proofreading there.

The word Stupid in itself is awful and shouldn't be used. My 5 year old who is in all day kindergarden had a project this week...to turn off the television and to read books. I took my daughter to the library today and we did a scavenger hunt of 8 authors....Harry Allard was one of those authors. Viola Swamp was easy to understand...but the Stupid Family isn't.

I just needed something to give me some measurements since all I had was rulers to measure by. The calipers soome to be accurate enough. I haven't had them calibrated (and they are not calibrated by the manufacturer), but by all accounts, if it is off, it couldn't be by more than a couple thousandths. They're not real smooth to use, but I have been able to look past that.The extra battery was a nice plus, but the case is impressive. In my opinion, the $11 I paid for this set was worth it just to get the case. It's a hard plastic case and I feel secure luggin my calipers around inside them.All-in-all, I have no problems using these calipers. For the price, I would recommend them to anyone that needed a pair, unless you need one for engineering that is calibrated.",

Instead of her life fulfilling her dreams, however, she spent her days baking bread, piecing quilts, and taking care of children. Her children eventually accomplished the great things Abbie had hoped to do, but they seemed to care little for the life Abbie herself had led. It was a disappointing book for me, but it aptly brought to life the hopes and dreams of a young girl, and how real life prevents her from living her dreams. It did inspire me to analyze my dreams, to see if they are realistic, and to consider whether God might have other plans. Good dreams may need to be exchanged for what is best for us.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

In general I did like the book. Both the narrative and the photos/illustrations were quite nice. I would have like to seen better reproductions of the maps. Having grown up in Chicago and attending the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana in the 1960s I got to be quite familiar with the passenger trains that connected those two cities. I think on balance the author was fair in his attention to the various geographic regions that this line served. Were he have gone into a lot more depth this book could easily have been 4 to 10 times as long. But then it wouldn't have been the easy read that it was.

Albert Camus' The Plague is a masterwork of 20th century literature as it examines the devestating effects of a deadly and bloody plague that breaks out all over the city. In the wake of a quarantine, Dr. Rieux and a handful of survivors band together to do what they can. In the long run, the only thing that any of them can really do to overcome the odds, is live. Though there are times when it is drawn out, The Plague manages to deliver an incredibly compelling story that examines human nature in the wake of incredible adversity, and it has never been done better since. The shocking imagery and perspectives presented here only further show Camus' mastery, and the equally shocking poignancy will surprise you even more so. Definitely not for everyone, The Plague is a masterpiece.",

The good news is there's nothing but perfect Rolling Stones songs - one after another. The Stones jump around from the pondering bluesy, \"Laugh, I Nearly Died\" to the hard paced, \"Driving Too fast\" and \"Rain Fall Down\". Some of the fun pops up with the blatantly political, \"Sweet Neo Con\" and the scathing, \"Look What The Cat Dragged In\". It's all new, fresh and lively as hell. Producer Don Was does a fantastic job getting the Stones to produce what is arguably their best album in over two decades. Rock on.\nAnswer:",

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product?\nReview title: Better now than 20 years ago\nProduct review: As a high school sophomore when Back to Egg came out, I remember that it was considered a \"wild rocker\" at the time (at least in my conservative rural high school). I listened to it back during that time and particulary liked the songs \"Getting Closer\" and \"Arrow Through Me\" (that latter was used in a Benji/Chevy Chase movie-seriously). But then came more serious McCartney works --the experimental McCartney II, the sublime Tug of War and quickly this album was pushed to the rear of my collection. In recent years, I have rediscovered it and now view it as McCartney's \"lost album.\" Even Paul has dissed this album but the songs have a clarity and attitude that make more sense to me know 20 years down the road. Okay, I still don't know what the heck he means by \"I'm getting closer, my salamander\" but gee it sounds so good. This is a McCartney junk-food album, many people don't like to admit that they like it but it sure does sound good and what a voice!!!",

The Brits really know how to make fun of themselves and make people laugh all over the World. I laughed so uncontrollably loud, my neighbors thought I was going crazy in this Frank Oz directed movie. The ongoing \"Valium\" gag was the real clincher in this movie; affecting Alan Tudyk's (Firefly, 3:10 To Yuma, Knocked Up) \"Simon\" to Peter Vaughn's \"Uncle Alfie.\" Peter Dinklage (In Bruges, 30 Rock, Nip/Tuck) adds fire to the Valium-induced high-jinks. Andy Nyman as Howard was uproariously funny. Bang-Bang laughs from the improbable happenings at a funeral service. Matthew MacFayden as \"Daniel,\" the long-suffering son, trying to keep order and decorum at his Dad's funeral, was the sinking sand amongst the solid rocks in attendance.

Its easy to see how Saddam saw his own predicament in this sentimental story of an old fisherman landing and losing a legendary fish. Hemingway was not, unfortunately, a good novelist. Hemingway's best short stories are some of the finest in the English language but he doesn't seem to have been able to sustain character and plot development sufficiently to produce really good novels. Even this short novel displays Hemingway's weaknesses as a novelist. Even worse, it is sentimental beyond belief, without any of the clear-eyed irony or insight into human nature exhibited in the best short stories. This is a weeper for middle-aged men. See any of the great Nick Adams stories for comparison. While this book appears to have revived Hemingway's career, at least in terms of popular readership, it really shows the decline of Hemingway's powers.",

Now, on the night before the night before Christmas, our younger daughter dresses up like Santa (more like a cute little elf) and reads this to us. It has become a beloved family tradition - one we almost missed out on because too late I discovered our copy had ended up in the donate pile by accident. Fortunately, Amazon was able to get us a copy in time so we were still able to enjoy our yearly reading. This book is a fun read for the whole family. The kids will love the rhyming & pictures. The adults will be able to relate to the hectic rush of the holiday. However, it's the ultimate story of family love that will shine through in the end!\nAnswer:",

        "Title: Packed With Knowledge!\nReview: With literary assistance from journalist Scott Huler, Continental Airlines CEO Gordon Bethune describes how he transformed the near-bankrupt airline into one of the best companies in the industry. He describes the massive changes he made to improve the product, changing a low-cost, unreliable airline to a top competitor that emphasizes customer service. The transformations he brought about by exerting strong leadership reshaped financial controls and employee-supplier-creditor relationships. The book is a fascinating read, written in a straightforward, this-is-how-it-was style, typified by Bethune's characterization of the company he took over as a... \"lousy\" airline with terrible service. Sometimes he gets a little repetitious in summarizing the action at each new step in the transformation, but that's just a minor complaint about an otherwise excellent book.....\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

Definitely much better than Discharge. I've listened to GBH songs for 15 years now and I never get tired of it. This is a good sized collection of songs although it did leave a lot of the other good stuff out like \"Bellend Bop\", \"Boston Babies\", \"Do What You Do\",\"Alcohol\" and \"Prayer of a Realist\". On the other hand, it has quite a lot of the other tunes here that are good like \"Generals\" and \"I'm the Hunted\". To all the kids out there who want to learn and experience hardcore music from my generation of the 80s, stick to the old GBH which is this one. Get this CD and if you can find a CD of City Baby Attacked By Rats, by all means pick that one up too.",

I think my favorites in the collection were \"The Prophet's Hair,\" and \"The Courter.\" In fact, I think \"The Prophet's Hair,\" was the story which truly reminded me that Rushdie knows how to turn a phrase. While at times there is a certain ambivalence in some stories, I think that is understandable in point of view of Rushdie's own background. It is an attitude that comes from being a product of two cultures and wanting to have claims to both, not just one or the other, as Rushdie so elegantly proclaims at the end of \"The Courter.&quot\nIs this product review negative?",

In the meantime, viewers are subjected to a bad, done before script,hammy acting, and violence out the wazoo! I had some higher hopes for this film ( at least as far as you can hope for with a Schwarzenegger film)as the trailers made it look like he was typed a little bit out of cast. But as soon as Arnold has to save Robin Tunney from the the incarnation of the Devil ( played very badly by the usually enjoyable Gabriel Byrne), he turns back to the action hero everyone loved before his surgery sidelined his career. Ultimately, it is a predictible film at best, and one that won't put Arnold back on the map. Oddly enough to mention in a review of a movie such as this, I would recommend instead the very cute Jingle All the Way for a different side of Mr Pumping Iron!\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Instead of reading this poorly conceived knock-off, I recommend that young readers check out Anne McCaffrey's Dragonsong trilogy, Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea series, Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain series, Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising series, or if you like SciFi, Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series.I found Eragon to be a simplistic reworking of stories/themes. It is sad that the publisher's of the 21st century are playing it \"safe\", like most modern entertainment, and giving us nothing new. I was surprised that Anne McCaffrey endorsed this book. She writes \"pulp fiction\" fantasy too, but hers is much better. He even takes the name \"Eragon\", which is very similar to a character in her book, The Skies of Pern, named Erragon.I've never returned a book for my money back, so this was a first.",

I prefer this style over the swivel because it's easier to control and I'm less apt to cut myself. The blades are sharp enough to skin some winter squash, but dull enough so that my blade-phobic friend can peel potatoes.The OXO rubber comfort grip is what distinguishes this peeler from others with similar designs. I can easily prepare enough russet and sweet potatoes, turnips, carrots, etc. for a large holiday dinner without getting a cramp and without the tool slipping from my wet hands.I've had mine for about 5 years and it's still in great condition, but having an online source for this is very convenient because in my area, most stores carry only the swivel version.",

In the first movie the 'lion scene' is realistic but delightful.So, if you liked this one (hey, its possible) or if you didn't, try 'King Solomon's Mines'!!peace out-CrowTurtle\nAnswer:",

I have not worked very much with Visual Basic to say how useful it is. From my experience with Access VBA I thought it dealt nicely with debugging tools and error handlers. I wanted to get a better feeling of debugging before going into other VBA books that reports indicate to be full of bugs. The book is nice in that it briefly touches on subjects like ADO. It seems like it will make a good reference. I really can't complain much since I paid one buck for the book. The only negative criticism that I can say to the authors is that the word open in Spanish is not abir, but abrir.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

It is a farce, plain and simple. The reviewers who panned it for its absurdity were right on target. This poorly written tale just constructs a nice little fantasy about a martyr instead of a real child and it sounds like \"Ozzie & Harriet Confront C.P.\" Although the anecdotes about the aminmals were cute, the whole book is written in a condescending tone. The racist name that one rabbit was given was insulting. Read \"Karen\" and \"With Love from Karen\" instead as these books complement your intelligence instead of insulting it like \"Wren\" does.

Sigmund Freud was the one who discovered that through our dreams we can explore our unconscious, which means that if we can unravel what our dreams mean, we can find out what our mind secretly wants and desires. These wants and desires are otherwise hidden and suppressed by our conscious mind because of our moral and social inhibitions and tensions. In fact, Sigmund Freud theories invented a whole new branch of treatment for neurosis. Freud's \"Interprettation of Dreams\" has its flaws, and his theories have been constantly modified and improved upon in accordance with new discoveries in contemporary psychology, but it was Freud who first put the wheels in spin.David Rehakauthor of \"Love and Madness\"\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

Although, known less for his singing than his songwriting abilities Medwick proves well beyond a dobt that he's got more than an average set of pipes, convincingly tackling everything from the guttiest of gut wrenching ballad's to sanctified soul, Texas funk and r&b numbers.This disc is certainly worth it's weight in soul, my only complaint being the sometimes oppresive church organ which challenges rather then compliments Mr.Medwick's efforts.

Ahora que he le\u00eddo Amuleto creo que fui benevolente con las estrellas a Nocturno de Chile, quiz\u00e1s ese libro merece 1 estrella por lo inc\u00f3modo de leer y Amuleto llega a dos simplemente porque al menos se deja leer. El final \"suena bien\" pero tomando la frase de un comentario de una rese\u00f1a en ingl\u00e9s \"mi alma no po\u00e9tica no entendi\u00f3 el punto por completo...\" (my unpoetic soul misses the point entirely...)\nIs this product review negative?",

In short, I'm sorry to say it was a bit of a letdown. EXCEPT man that cover is wild! Might I make the suggestion that better packaging would help a future edition? By that I mean dress up the interior with art and design that matches the grand cover. That would really spark this tome up.",

Then it appears that she is an angel and that everyone else in the town is worshipping Satan. She finally destroys them all--or God does; it's hard to say for sure. Then she implies to her rescuer, played by Hilary Swank, that the baby Swank is carrying is evil and the spawn of Satan...and that they both have to take care of the little devil. Huh?This movie just couldn't make up its mind. Is it supposed to be a story of faith or devil worship or what?

I mounted it to the bracket on my recently-purchased Topeak MTX E-Type rear luggage rack exactly according to the directions. The light was securely fastened -- or at least as much as the mounting bracket allowed. On my first ride with the light attached, it somehow got shaken loose and fell off at some point in this short, just under 10 mile commute.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

In the beginning she irritated me with her swooning style of singing and her german pronunciation. However, she grew into the role and got around even the most difficult parts successfully. She kept the girlish element in her voice prominent, but also played her like a real spoilt girl. I feel though that her direction was too contrived, her movements too static. Michael Devlin's voice is also an acquired taste. The supporting roles were well cast. A worthy choice if compared with the more recent ROH production with Malfitano and Terfel. My top choice is still the production from Berlin with Sinopoli conducting.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Also it has a tendency to grab cables which happen to be nearby.2) it's insanely noisy. If you live in a condo, all your neighbors will enjoy the sound.3) it's suction power is fairly weak4) if you need to reach high above cabinets and fridge to vacuum the dust, this vacuum cleaner is not the tool5) the power cord constantly gets under the vacuum brush; you have to hold it in your hand to avoid this.

He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them, and you can't wait to find the next book especially if it's got Sean Dillon.But not this one. All the characters are wooden. The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour. Don't bother. Read some of Higgins's earlier works instead.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Like others, I would have much preferred to see the band performing live and less of the filler.

It seemed to me the writer was trying too hard to be humorous and spent too much time thinking up clever witticisms instead of focusing on the content. But as the book progressed, she seemed to relax into her writing and it became far more fun for the reader. The pacing is a bit uneven here and there, and yes, she does take us off on unrelated tangents occasionally; in the end, however, it only adds to the endearing quality of this unabashed and heartfelt tribute to the greatest cook in American history.I admire Julie Powell's courage in tackling a project of this magnitude - as a long-time Julia Child devotee, I was relieved to see someone else had the same *&^%$ struggles with marrowbone that I did - and, although Julie, her husband, or her family might curse me for even suggesting it, I wouldn't be disappointed if she decided to tackle MtAoFC, Vol. 2.",

Now imagine you travel to another planet and their atmosphere and gravity are lighter, having been used to heavier gravity you would now be able to fly. And bullets that would destroy and kill the people of that planet would just bounce off you. That is why Kryptonite does not kill Superman, it would be equal to someone from that other planet giving you a rock or piece of earth, it would make you \"normal\" or weak.Of course none of this is reality, it is just science fiction fun, but it is the truth behind Superman's powers, not this Smallville nonsense!Let's get the facts straight.

The portrayals of W's staff were more parodies than portrayals. Thandie Newton is a great actress ( NOT TO MENTION FINE), but her performance as Rice was pathetic. What was even worse than that one was the one of Powell, Keanu Reeves could have made a better Colin Powell. The rest were almost as bad. All Stone accomplished was taking good actors and making them play bad parts to try and destroy the image of a sitting President. That is obvious to even the most casual observer.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

A Jimmy Buffett concert always says to me there are new places to explore but don't forget what got you here. I have heard this CD and as soon as I am finished with this review I am placing an order. The only change I would suggest is I wish he had included A Pirate Looks at Forty (50?).I read a review earlier that suggested Mr. Buffett record a CD live & unplugged of all of his old stuff and in a somewhat mellow but upbeat style.

You would purchase this album more for historical value if your fan of the greatest rock band of the 80's rather than for the actual songs on here. This album is where it all began and the tracks are not as substantial guitar wise or lyrically as the boys will achieve on their later masterpieces. Unless you are a huge Bon Jovi fan you probably will not want this album. Bon Jovi have created some of the greatest albums ever made and New Jersey and Slippery When Wet would be my recommendations if you do not own any of their albums at all and are looking to start.",

Lewy demonstrates the superficiality of the more extreme opponents of the war--those who accused the US of violating international law but were blind to the horrors involved in the actions of North Vietnam and the Viet Cong.

I love Jarrett's rapid right-hand runs in the group context -- e.g. in 1976's THE SURVIVORS' SUITE, recorded a year after KOLN -- but I find them dizzying in a solo setting.Compare the number of piano key depressions per minute on KOLN with a later work like DARK INTERVALS (1987) or THE MELODY AT NIGHT WITH YOU (recorded in 1999 after suffering the agonies of ME), and you'll likely get a hit rate some four times faster.Yes, I own some New Age CDs by the likes of George Winston and Philip Aaberg, and I rarely listen to those either. Jarrett is streets ahead of both of these, and other jazz imitators like Lyle Mays. But if I want to hear 1970s solo Jarrett, I tend to choose BREMEN LAUSANNE or even wade into SUN BEAR CONCERTS.\nAnswer:",

The children who were cast for this film were obviously picked for their looks only, as none of them displays any trace of talent, as evidenced by their lifeless delivery of lines. The script seems to have been patched together from bits and pieces of the old gags, with some dreadfully unfunny new lines added. The direction is also terribly inept; it is quite obvious that Ms. Spheeris has no idea what she is doing. It is very sad to see a legendary comedy series thus desecrated.

Sadly Hemingway shot almost every living animal on this planet until the only thing left to shoot was himself.

        "Title: Be Careful If You Use Windows 95\nReview: After struggling to get my Belkin Wireless card to work in my laptop running Windows 95B I finally called for Tech Support. According to them, only Version One of their wireless card will work with 95B. I had a Version Two. Version One cards can be identified by a single LED Light on the card while later versions have two lights.At any rate, I've still been unable to get the card to work with Windows 95B as its been advertisied. Tech support was no help after I exchanged my Version Two Card for a Version One and was down right rude after I followed their instructions and still couldn't get the card to work.If you're planning on using the card with Windows 95B, be sure to get a Version One card, and be prepared for a lot of disappointment.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

        "Title: Pretty good movie\nReview: Master And Commander wasn't too shabby. Although I am no Naval Historian, I have seen other peroid pieces (Horatio Hornblower Series, etc...), and they were better in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, the movie was entertaining, but it lacked more action. The final battle scene could have used a little more work also. I understand that close quarter battle needs to look confining, but from a viewer standpoint, it would have been more enjoyable if you could have seen more of the fight. Not quite the epic masterpiece that a lot of people say that it is, but it was entertaining.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

I'm not cool with any main characters inflicting mortal wounds on other protagonists, even and especially accidentally. If the Hero weren't a DH than he'd have been dead and when she noticed she'd stabbed a man who was not a daemon, she didn't seem particularly perturbed. I've liked Tabitha in the other books, but she didn't seem as smart-alecky in the beginning of this one. Also there was nothing really unique about Valerius. I was just bored with it and I decided this one would SO not be a good use of my evening. Anyway so I'll read the next one and hope it gets better.",

What impressed me about Flowers was that for the first time in a romance novel, I encountered an author who assumes that romance readers have intelligence. Not only does she challenge her readers to follow the Quaker thee/thou speech, she also puts her readers inside of Jervaulx's mind and forces us to see and hear the world through his stroke-damaged perceptions--a world where simple English words have little meaning. She then takes this one step further, challenging us to follow along with her, by letting us feel Jervaulx's frustration and rage and letting us hear what he hears as he tries to understand Maddy's thee/thou Quaker speech. Ingenious! I've read somewhere that Kinsale's greatest skill is in taking a hero that no one could love and making you want to lick his boots by the end of the story. This is never truer than in Flowers from the Storm. This book needs to be reprinted!\nAnswer:",

I agree with the author because the boys were so innocent in the beginning but as time goes bye that soon changes. The author best handled symbolism. For example, the conch represented authority and Piggy's glasses represented nearsightedness. These symbols helped me understand the book. The book wasn't believable because I don't think that a bunch of boys ranging from the ages of 5 and 13 can really survive on an island all by themselves. I think the author shouldn't have Piggy and Simon die in such a cruel way. If I had a choice I would've let them live and I would've had Ralph and Jack become friends again.Overall, I thought the book was good.",

Absent father-figure, over-bearing mother and other elements mentioned within are exactly the sort of things some researchers say is behind homosexuality. It seems as if David himself gives credence to bebunking the widely-accepted myth that homosexuals are \"born that way\" rather than being raised that way.Regardless, \"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\" was a quirky and quick summer read. I found myself laughing out-loud several times. No doubt about it, Sedaris is a gifted wordsmith and I may pick up more of his writings.

The ease of making a single cup of coffee throughout the day made it vastly superior to making a whole pot that lost flavor as time went on. However, after about six months the machine started making 4 ounce cups rather than 8 ounce cups. I have used only filtered water since day one and had descaled the machine as well to prevent any mineral buildup. After numerous calls to Keurig and researching the issue on the web I could not change the short cupping problem. It seemed as though the water pump was just giving out. At about 8 months the machine finally stopped working altogether. Have seen reviews of the Keurig OfficePro line that are positive and have decided to give that one a try. While supposedly containing a noisier water pump the machine does not seem to stop working suddenly. Will update this review after using the Keurig OfficePro.\nAnswer:",

It didn't sound like the Clay we have all come to know and love. The first few tracks sounded a bit \"over-produced\" and lacked the style that makes Clay special, but as the album progresses, so do the quality of the recordings. After a few listens to the album, I've found that every song has something special to offer whether it be Clay's vocals or the lyrics or the music itself. One thing I enjoy most about the album is that it has more of a \"rock\" type feel to it on many of the tracks and doesn't fall strictly into the \"pop\" genre as most people come to know it (eg.

This poignant tale is set in Provence in southern France. The beautiful scenery is truly breathtaking. Heard throughout, the haunting score will stay in your mind for days after viewing the film. Yves Montand is superb as the aging, greedy Cesar Soubeyran. Gerard Depardieu is never better than in the title role as the hopeful and yet tragic hunchback hero. The English sub-titles in no way detract from this cinematographical delight.\nAnswer:",

Because my baby was constantly tugging my nipples down I was cracked and bleeding for two months. I finally put it in the closet thinking I could at least use it when he started sitting up. I think he sat in it about 5 times before he could sit up on his own so I was disappointed I had wasted the closet space storing it. After talking to my girlfriends I found out that everyone GETS a boppy but most people don't actually use them. They just don't bother to post reviews! If you need a nursing pillow there are lots of other ones out there, just not at BRU!\nIs this product review negative?",

I recommend both and I recommend reading them in this order. Kingsolver points out the callous and self-serving nature of middle and upper-class America in a very emotional way. Frank points out the same in a much more dispassionate way and then offers viable solutions. I found this book to be well-written, even-handed, thorough, and absorbing.

My daughter is in her third reading since we purchased this volume as a Christmas present in December, 06, and is the only one reading it in the house. Chunks of pages have begun falling out of the binding. The spine is paper, and not sturdy at that.I'm no expert on bookbinding, but this casts an image (for me, at least) of cheapness over the publisher. I'd like to have thought that for the price, this could have been expected to last a bit longer than 4 months.I guess this one's not going to be an heirloom. I've had many, many paperbacks that are in better condition after similar use.Sad, really, for such a wonderful work, to have been packaged this way.",

This book provides a broad overview of the diplomatic and bureaucratic struggles that produced the settlement, from the British point of view. Unfortunately, it is poorly written, poorly edited, oddly footnoted, and generally disappointing. It almost appears to have been written in bits and pieces that were later stitched together, with little effort made to eliminate redundancy or streamline the writing. A more rigorous editing would have shortened it considerably with no loss of impact. However, the breadth of its coverage, and the importance of the topic, may make it a useful starting point for those interested in this area.\nAnswer:",

Ignatius is the personification of the obnoxiousness that resides in all of us, and Toole's carefully crafted words paint a vivid picture of New Orleans, Levy Pants, and his mother's house. His letters to the Minx are somewhat tedious, but humouress nonetheless, his descriptions unique, apt, and crass.

I have only listened to the tapes for a week and i am already beginning to feel a difference in my thinking and acting. Mr Waitley presents plenty of knowledge and usable tips on how to think and to act. I also think the series is enjoyable to listen to. There is a difference between the other books and tape series i have read/listened to. I think the biggest difference is that this one is an easy to follow complete course on how to live a successful life, whereas many others don't feel complete, just bits and pieces. I think it is the best tape series and probably the best in personal development i have ever read/heard. I will follow this program and i think it is going to make miracles in my life.

Vista is a letdown. Two major oh-no's:- The help is useless. Searching for a unknown term or reference produces a long list of possible articles, but the searched term may not show up in any of them. I don't have hours to puruse through mindless unrelated articles. XP help highlighted the searched term; it worked fine. Why did they ruin it?- The location of various menu items is scrambled. I don't mean 'rearranged', I mean scrambled. Drawing in Word or PowerPoint is an exercise in frustration. It's one menu to create an object, a different one to flip or group, etc. I'm sure the new arrangement makes sense to someone, I'm just not sure that someone is playing with a full deck.I'm still looking for redeeming features.

Now I know better.MVT offers much faster results and appeals to me because it solves the most fundamental business problem - which ideas work, which ideas don't, and which don't matter. Once you know this with confidence, any business problem can be solved, any process improved. After refining your experimental results and implementing the corrective actions, you cannot escape improvement unless you sabotage the process.Fascinating reading about many companies who have used MVT to achieve extraordinary gains.

We all respect those who actually try to live by their convictions, but living with them can be tough.I learned a new swear word, 'rutting' an ingenious way of inserting harsh reality to the dialogue without resorting to course language.Whoever said that stories of faith have a happy ending, this one has a kind of bitter sweet conclusion.

It was definately a fine book. Fine being Ok not good but not horrible. It was an easy read with nothing to miss seeing as Gibbons pushes everything down your throat. Not much thinking needed for this one. I would have liked to see more of what a child sees in a mother. Not what a commercial says one should be. If the book had gone into more depth and actualy painted the characters with lives outside of Hattie's I might have found it more interesting. For a mediocre read about woman who goes from insane woman with passions to a Stepford Wife whom Jesse Helms himself would be proud of, pick this book up. If it doesn't sound good your money is better put to laundry or a good CD.",

The acting is lame and the story is pathetic. The only thing I commend the filmmakers for is trying to create an original twist to the series. Too bad they failed miserably and created the worst embarrassment to horror films since CGI. Don't waste your time with this one.

He writes in a manner that has much detail but is easily read. Mr. Phillips, a life-long Republican, presents to me, a moderate Democrat, an evenhanded discussion of these problems. He is not a fan of the Bush family so if you are one of the 30% who still believe in Dubya, you are not going to like this book.You may agree with his thesis or disagree with it but it is a very worthwhile read to at least think about his points.",

I think the longest hike I've done is 8 or 9 miles in a day, but I've done quite a bit of vertical including Mailbox and Snoqualmie Mountain and these have never let me down.

It is the type of book where, you are placed in the middle of a totally different area, and you are left to figure out how it works. Gradually, you learn more and more, and things you thought were obviously true, weren't. However, there are some things in this book that are unacceptable. For instance, this society is very complex, and yet, there was still only one active plot throughout the entire book. There was not a single scene that did not contain the main character. This book has the potential to be alot more entertaining to read, if it were to have more subplots. Also, the book is very simply written when it comes to the grammar and choice of vocabulary, thus, you do not have to be \"mature\" to understand this book at all.\nAnswer:",

Instead of seeing simple, common terminology such as \"add\" or \"subtract\", I saw \"some, some more\" and \"larger, smaller, difference\". What this book has done is take basic concepts that are familiar to nine-year-olds and convoluted them, apparently trying to make simple tasks even easier. With books like these, which fail to use standard terminology, it's no wonder that America's youth is struggling with math skills. Addition and subtraction are basic skills that all students must know, and this book is doing our bright kids a disservice.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Whether squatting to pick up a heavy object or climbing across blocked off areas to get merchandise, this pant gives me ample room. If you have thicker thighs, that might be a problem. After 10+ washes, it's still rough. I don't mind though. I normally wear a 30 L and it should be fine but this one seems to ride up on the back of the shoe. It didn't shrink or anything after the washes but it just needs a tug to get it back down after going up stairs. Maybe I'll get the 31 L next time. The waist was fine. Big plus is that my sweat doesn't show through under the waist line for some reason. That's good because w/ my old pants, once the sweat dried, it would leave a white residue on my backside.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

Despite being written by Orwell in the 40s, this classic novel is still relevant. Instead of the Ministry of Information, we have the TSA and other government authorities telling us things we know not to be true. Orwell was a prophet when it came to predicting how governments would try to keep control of information. Fortunately for us, there is no \"memory hole\" down which inconvenient facts can disappear - we have the Internet and the free flow of information. As Orwell wrote in his book, the story of our age is one of government against the individual. 1984 is a great cautionary tale and a prescient warning to all who love liberty, to be on guard against tyranny.",

However, with a larger budget than Star Trek would eventually have, it has much more in the way of bells and whistles.It has a Captain, a fair maiden, a stately scientist, a cadre of astronauts (who really act like WWII Navy men right down to the stereotypically undisciplined \"cook\" character,) a mysterious robot with unknown intentions, and a force that that threatens to destroy them all.This is one of the few science fiction films from the Fifties that is both entertaining AND intelligent.

Personally, I didn't like the book very much. It was very slow moving with very little action and not many interesting events. The book said it was based on a true story, but really it never happened and that upset me. So I guess this book is realistic fiction based on facts. It is a short book that is based on facts about the interaction between wolves and other animals. If this sounds interesting, then read the book.

        "Title: About Nothing\nReview: Fresh of watching \"About A Boy\" I felt like Hugh Grant could do no wrong, so despite less than stellar reviews I decided give \"Two Weeks Notice\" a shot, which was a mistake. While there are some comedic moments, this a romantic comedy and Bullock and Grant have NO chemistry. In most of the scenes they seem only mildly aware of eachother mostly focusing on thier actions. As a result, I never felt like they should be together. Further, the plot seems to jump around. Right after getting hired, the plot leapfrogs to weeks later where Grant and Bullock are now supposed to be chumy, but I never felt it. THey seem to be tired of eachother and their action forced by the plot's simple-minded purpose. After his great romantic comedies of the 1990s, this a huge step down for Grant and even for Bullock, who mostly makes bad movies anyway. This is not worth your time because it clearly wasn't even worth the actors full attention.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

As if that weren't goofy enough, she decides to construct her monster using the brain of her father's assistant (whom she's just married) and the body of the hunky village idiot. It's a movie that could only be made in Italy and only in the '70s. Recommended for Euro-horror fanatics only.The picture and sound quality on this DVD could be better, but I've definitely seen worse on bargain-priced DVDs like this. The print that was used is scratchy at times, but the colors are still fairly vibrant and sound is generally quite good.

What can be funnier than seeing a bunch of people get pelted with red rubber balls? But somewhere during execution, the film lost whatever magic it may have had. Ben Stiller's character is like a lame version of Zoolander, that tries to be funny, but fails horribly. Vince Vaughn is also not funny and not a likeable character along with his crew of strange outcasts of life. When they got Ben and Vince against each other, I could care less who won.Simple movie goers may like this film, but people looking for a comedy that's more than just stupid one liners (that aren't even good.) Dodgeball does not deliver. When I went to see this movie I expected nothing from it, and I got less. I'm only giving this 2 stars because of a few cheap laughs it had that actualy were successful, other than that, it was a complete failure. One of the worst movies of 2004.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

It was so 'heavy' that I read it over and over and over. Not ony were the quotes so deep that I still quote them to others in 'need' to this day. I keep my old book in my emergency kit - it's very important to me in times of crisis - including our annual wildfire evacuations. Perhaps it's because I AM Jewish, but, I really understood, found depth in life and understanding. It also calmed my anxieties on death to a certain extent as well, something I have a hard time dealing with, mortality. What a brillant man, to not only survive a true living hell, but to rise above and become such a great person, author, doctor!!

Some of the info in the book can be used without reading in depth and I used some of the techniques to ease stiffness in pets right away. I haven't pick it up much because it isn't a \"light read\", at least to me- not a book to read to past time.

The pages practically turn themselves in this tale of Bilbo and the Ring. Bilbo's journey is epic. Our humble hobbit faces up to great dangers, is morally and physically challenged. In the end Bilbo is transformed by the journey: he becomes more courageous, more generous, and more a complete living being. I read this as a twelve year old and absolutely relished every page: it's readability is outstanding. The far more imaginative Lord of the Rings trilogy is often badly written and overdrawn. The later work has obviously lit the fires of fifty million dreams, but this first book is the more taut. While many readers will dislike the trilogy and recoil from its complexities, nearly everyone can enjoy this wonderful story.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

However I soon noticed that no sooner had the story started to get interesting than King would switch away to another storyline, completely killing the suspense. The plot lacks originality and owes a great debt in particular to the Alien films. It is rambling and incoherent and I suspect that without the King name it would have never seen the light of day. He has managed the feat of writing a book which is way way too long yet failing to fill in many important details of the past which are hinted at all the way through the novel.

The dvd spends most of the hour on a native Indian and how he uses the art of sand painting to express his view of the world. This was not what I expected. There were parts however, that did get into how the eye works and how there are 4 sections of the brain used for seeing (the 4 parts are form, shape, color, and movement) and somehow the brain presents us with a unified experience of all these processes. Also, how the same neuro-pathways we use for imagining an object and actually seeing it are the same. I really enjoyed those parts yet so much time was spent on the subjective evaluations of how this Indian sees the world that I considered it a waste of time. The ratio was about 20 minutes on vision / brain activity and 40 minutes on this Indian's view of the world. Very disappointing indeed.\nAnswer:",

The problems are 1. each section is difficult to get to \"snap\" securely 2.once together, they snap apart again easily, making it difficult to play with the ship 3. the rails have to be adjusted each time the sections come on and off 4. the only way to get a pirate out of the \"dungeon\" is to take that section off the ship then try to fit it back together! The age recommendation is 4-5, and yes, my 3-1/2 yr. old was frustrated with it, but my 6-1/2 yr. old even had trouble with keeping the ship together.

I'm not familiar with Kevin's later works, but of his early post Soft Machine work, i find this to be the most challenging and rewarding. The album is four tracks long, though all are the containers for several lovely songs that are pieced together through sound collages and disjointed jams. Fans of Gorkys Zygotic Mynchi, Super Furrys, and OTC should definitly give this a try. I would suggest also ordering it directly from the label's (BGO Records) website where it can be purchased for 10 pounds.\nIs this product review negative?",

I tried only one reed, and found it a bit more toward the medium than the soft, and for me at least it was difficult to play some notes and in general was not fun to play.

And they can also write learned papers about it that they can publish in their academic journals. As William Goldman said in THE SEASON, \"As long as there is a PhD. candidate alive, James Joyce will never die.\" Joyce himself said something to the effect of: \"The professors will be analyzing FINNEGAN'S WAKE forever.\" John Lennon said, \"All artist's are egomaniacs, whether they like to admit it or not.\" And Joyce is indulging in egomania with FINNEGAN'S WAKE. He spent 17 years on this book because he knew people would spend (waste?) hours, days, years of their lives trying to get to the \"truth\" of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, and feel superior to the great unwashed who don't even know such a work of literature exists.

Arriving in Berlin, performing at the Deutschlandhallen, this album runs the full dynamic gamut. On the one hand, it contains a subtle \"Summertime\" where her melodic embellishments are absolutely inspired. But then Ella, now in the home of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, decides to fill the set with \"Mac the Knife,\" recently made a hit by both Bobby Darrin and Louis Armstrong. When the words come unraveled before her, her improvisation is awe-inspiring. This is directly followed with the definitive live \"How High the Moon,\" complete with an 8 minute scat that is unequalled. This reissue is somewhat marred by the presence of two tracks mistakenly thought to have been part of the performance, but which are of a noticeably different character. Nonetheless, amazing.\nIs this product review negative?",

So after the great reviews I had read about it, I gave SSHHBB a try, but I'm really disappointed. The game suffers from some sort of \"keep scores close\" programming when you play against cpu controlled teams. Once the human player starts scoring, the cpu controlled team suddenly hits everything. Example: David Cone hitting a homer of a Kerry Wood curve ball that was out of the strike zone low and away.

This is an extremely witty book that examines the social mores of the English villagers of their class and time. It's not actually a long way between this and Joanna Trollope. It's a type of literature the English have been doing superbly for, well, centuries. This is not a hard book to read. It has nicely observed things to say about class attitudes, but is not particularly profound or deep. Just enjoyable.Younger readers might find it hard, especially if they have not had experience of the type of social structures and attitudes depicted.

When I saw this it was only 78 minutes with no jokes and I am being serious 78 minutes with no jokes there was maybe like only one joke in the movie and that's it. I do like Seann William Scott the guy who played Stiffler in the hilarious movie American Pie but this was one of his worst movies ever made. I can't wait for American Pie 2 to come out and I hope that's a lot better then this piece of [...]. This was the worst movie I have seen since The Stupids. If you want to see a better comedy movie go rent American Pie, Scary Movie, or Road Trip you will get more laughs in those movies then this. I hated this movie and I do not want to see it again please, do not waste your time on this piece of junk it's stupid.\nIs this product review negative?",

Reuven Malter , one of the main charchters from the book gets hit in the head with a baseball by Danny Saunders, one of the Hasidic boys during a baseball game. Throughout the book, Danny and Reuven become good friends. The two boys do alot of things together, such as study torah and Talmud. Not only is this book about the boys good friend ship, but also about the relationship of father and son. But because of the different beliefs of both their fathers, the boys are not allowed to see each other. This book, demonstrated friendship and helped educate people on the Jewish Religion.",

Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of \"What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores.\" What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs.\nAnswer:",

The temperature dial on the unit is virtually meaningless. Using thermometers to test the dial's settings, I've found the dial to be very inaccurate. For example, if I want ambient air of 68 degrees, I have to set the dial to about 60-62. The unit also doesn't really work below 40 degrees, no matter how low a set the temperature dial. Personally, I would not buy this again, or recommend this product to anyone. You're better off spending a little extra money for a newer, better unit.

People kills each other sometimes only for the pleasure of killing (think about the sniper in the Washington DC area 3 years ago) One of the reasons for this is what we see in the movies.

I was relieved to find out that it doesn't take much pressure at all. I love this pistol. It's a .22 caliber, single shot, bolt-action, 460 feet-per-second pellet pistol. The adjustable rear sight makes it easy to adjust the aim so that the shots on target are accurate. In my other pellet pistol, I would keep a fresh CO2 powerlet in the pistol, but not screwed in tightly enough to puncture it. I would finish screwing it in when I was ready to start firing it. In this pellet pistol, no matter how lightly I screwed in the CO2 powerlet it would puncture the powerlet and the gas would start leaking out; so, when replacing the powerlet it has to be screwed all the way in whether you're going to start firing it or not--or keep the new powerlet out of the pistol until you're ready to start firing it.\nAnswer:",

However, the writers appear to have a poor grasp of theology or the nature of academic research, making the writing inauthentic and unbelievable. This also killed any of the theological import it could have had.Further, the production values were poor at best. The camera was kept almost exclusive at a middle/close-up, with very few to non-existent cut-aways or alternate shots. Long takes cans be effective when they have a reason, but here they were merely dull. Further, the sets were bare and inauthentic and uninteresting. The shots were almost uniformly too long (each one could have lost a few seconds at least), making the pacing unbearably slow.Overall, there is almost nothing to recommend this film.\nAnswer:",

Seems a high rating for a movie that generally has had a somewhat mediocre reception. I rated M.I. accordingly because it's a movie I have revisited on quite a few occasions and have always thoroughly enjoyed it. Tom Cruise is a very talented actor, but it is the twisting story-line, exciting climatic action sequence and theft of the NOC list scene from the CIA that sends this movie into my 5 star rating category. The DVD version I have, has no special features, aside from a theatrical trailer. If I were rating this on the DVD itself then it would certainly rate very low. All in all, a favourite movie of mine, with action, suspense, espionage and a twist. Highly recommended.",

At first, I was hooked on the mystery of why this innocent woman was kidnapped and wanted to know more about her kidnappers and their motives. However, the reasoning behind their actions didn't seem as effective as it could have been. Maybe that was an easier way out instead of writing about someone doing this because of their belief in saving a precious life, doing anything they can to protect the baby that grows inside of our main character. Regardless, it was an enjoyable read and one of Ketchum's stronger works, along with The Off Season, Offspring, Old Flames, and The Girl Next Door - my favorite of his books.\nAnswer:",

However, Microsoft Press suggests this book for intermediate to advanced users. I would target this at beginning to (perhaps) intermediate users. Others will be disappointed as I was.Lots to disagree with here as well. A recomendation is made to only place ByRef in parameter definitions if the user INTENDS to change the parameter while in the routine. ByRef parameters which the user does not intend to change receive no prefix. Not the best advice. Another section suggests branching to a graceful exit point if input data is invalid. Since invalid input data generally suggests a problem elsewhere in the code, a better suggestion is assertion (a subject not discussed and perhaps out of scope) and/or raising an error. Some of the treatments seem pretty shallow - for example, the section on error handling is more a tutorial on the basic error object.",

I am new to hoop dancing and I watched both of these DVDs from beginning to end without hooping just to concentrate on the instructions. I think they are both excellent DVDs as they are very clear, organized and concise. If you are trying to decide on which one to get, I recommend that you start with the Level 1, but really you should get both. I plan to collect these as they come out, they are really that good. (Note that these aren't exercise routine DVDs - they are for learning the techniques of hoop dancing.)",

When the DVD came out I thought how great it would be to finally see this film the way it was meant to be seen, Widescreen. But when I got the DVD I noticed the horror of what has been done to it. This version is NOT Widescreen, it is not even the cropped version we saw on the VHS. The picture is just CUT even further and added with \"black bulks\" on top and bottom to CHEAT the Widescreen effect. The picture is so much CUT DOWN that sometimes it's not even clear what is going on. Buying this DVD is like paying to watch only 40% of the film. This is bad, SHAME on the people at FOX HOME VIDEO. Don't buy this DVD....seeing it like this is going to ruin the experience and this great film.

I could have found the One Ring faster than try to follow the bad editing mistakes from one page to the next. I do not know how the written work is transferred from book to e-book, but when they did the Hobbit, someone hit the mead a bit early.

But there are several issues.While it sounds great that it slips under the mounts, you still have to retain the seat and cover. Doing so means that you cannot lower the cover or raise the \"seat\". A work around to the unusual situation of having the cover and old seat in place would be to acquire additional bolts and nut to retain just this product.Another bigger issue is that it turns an elongated toilet into a smaller then normal round toilet. My 145lb mother fits on it fine, but as a 240lb male, I can't use this seat in her apartment.Previously I had tried a 4\" extension type unit that worked perfectly with the normal seat and cover allowing both to be utilized, but it was too high for her. I now need to look for a 2\" version of that style. Note that this item is non-returnable.I do not recommend purchasing this item at all.\nAnswer:",

Lelaina is valedictorian of her class, but she is stuck in a dead-end job at a tv station. Meanwhile, she makes a documentary of her and her friend's lives, taking an often very personal look at what each of them is like. Soon she meets Michael, an up and coming businessman who isn't well liked by her friend Troy, a poetic and intelligent man who lacks the motivation to find a real job. What results is a strange love triangle as Lelaina tries to find out who she really is and what she needs.What is really great about this movie is the strong cast that includes Winona Ryder, Ethan Hawke, and Ben Stiller. You can relate to Ryder's character of Lelaina, trying to find herself in a crazy world that won't grant you any favors. I highly recommend this movie.",

I think Amazon sent me the wrong item to me and it is amazon that made the mistake. I cannot find a way to contact the staff of amazon to illustrate my issue, which is really a bad customer experience.",

The connector would not stay in, because it was a prong-type connector and not a USB connector. The company sent me a new cord, but it would not stay in, either. I tried every which way to support the connector, so it would stay in, but finally gave up!Bought the Zalman, and it has a variable fan, which is almost silent and haven't had a moment's problem with it.You won't regret going with the Zalman.",

Besides the historical inaccuracies as detailed by earlier reviewers here on Amazon - I felt the actors chosen to play these music icons weren't based on ability, but to try and get a younger audience to pay attention to the film. Mos' Def is NOT an actor in any way, shape or form - his portrayal of Chuck Berry was wooden and inaccurate. On the other hand, Eamonn Walker's take on Howlin' Wolf was STUNNING. I'm sure the makers intentions were good - but the obvious budget restraints and poor choices in actors left me feeling like a great opportunity to shed light on an otherwise under-documented period of music history was squandered.",

He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material.\nAnswer:",

I cannot even concentrate on what I am reading because the book is so darn BORING! I sit there reading every single word of it, but I think about something else. I read \"Bilbo blah blah blah,\" but think \"Oh what am I gonna do today after school?\" And then when it somes testing time, I cannot remember a thing I read, and the teacher thinks I didn't read it. I really, truly hate this book. This is the worst book I have ever read! It's even worse than the unabrigded version of \"The Prince and The Pauper\", which I was also forced to read against my will. I would have given this book zero stars, but the lowest you are allowed to go is one. DO NOT WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF WASTE.",

That movie had it's over done scenes, but, it never went overboard like JFK, Nixon, Any Given Sunday . . . well, all his flicks since 1987's Wall Street.For anyone foolish enough to still retain affects from the conspiracy talk . . . it's just a movie from a bad director.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

It is haunting, compelling, hard to put down. A lot to think about. This book should make us question where we are going and also make us take a hard look at the past. This current weekend of Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday was an excellent time to read this. As the book addresses much about memories, both painful and pleasurable, this is an opportune time to reflect on our beliefs, actions towards others, and what we want for our children. An outstanding book, The Giver is wonderful for young people and adults.

Especially interesting to me is the historical account of the making of Key West, the Spanish War, life in China during the Japanese invasion, and World War II intrigue.

She is an outcast and made fun of by everyone.The extras are actually more interesting than the movie! Clips of Moz conventions and psycho-fans are pretty funny. The extras actually have a couple of Moz photos/distant video-cam clips.I LOVE Moz but HATE this movie. Please, borrow it, rent it, or steal it but DONT waste your hard-earned cash on it.

The witchcraft angle was old after the first one, and they proceed to do several more after. My pet peeve with writers is when they just want you to buy a romantic spark by just writing it. That's just being lazy. I don't see why either of them liked each other.

This band can play! Unfortunately, I just can't get past the vocals and lyrics to listen to it and enjoy the instruments. If you want a cheap copy of this, check the shoulder off of I-405, that's where I've tossed mine. Seriously, for the complete package, do yourself a favor and check out BBVD!",

BORING SNOOZFEST. if you want a good ridley scott sci fi movie, rent ALIEN, even though that is really a horror movie. still, the characters are more interesting and the story more engaging than this over rated piece of crapola.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Originally they were going to call it Transformers: Armada but then the cartoon changed to Energon and so they scrapped the Armada part. The Mini-cons are a part of the Armada and Energon worlds NOT the G1 world. The game play does take time to get used to but with some time devoted becomes much easier. This is not an easy game.

The transfer is absolutely atrocious. Yes, people who don't know any better won't notice it, but if you have a system properly calibrated and have seen a better transfer, the comparisons are ridiculous. It is impossible to watch this blu ray and not be distracted by the lack of resolution and all the haloes around every single strand of hair, every spear, every building.

Mr. Hoiback does an excellent job, in a very concise manner, to describe the linkage between Authority, Intent, and Dissemination of command. He then uses two case studies that show the relationships in the real world.I really appriciated the second case study showing the opening days of WWII in Norway. The case study told the story of COL Erickson who took the initiative to sink a German Cruiser amid the cowardice of the politicians and the inadequate preparations to maintain Norway's neutrality; a story I never read before this book. I would recommend reading the second case study before the first case study discussing the GEN Haig in the First World War. By reading the Second Case study first, I believe that case study one will be easier to follow.Eric",

No, theyre not unfunny. The jokes just, far too often, come, and simply refrain from BEing funny. It's unfortunate. The Universal Language is a play that is always FUN to do, and one that will never leave peoples brains, but it's not entertaining because of any wit. This is what tends to happen to Ives. He gets going, and write a great play, but the characters don't have much depth, are not particularly interesting to play, and don't manage to actually be comical too frequently, so it's really not worth it to want to participate in the plays.

I have to say that I am thankful I didn't pay the premium cost they are asking for this product. It was the most uncomfortable shave I've ever had next to dry-shaving. The idea of the single blade on the reverse side for \"precision\" is only useful because the five blade side is so bulky it can't be manipulated well enough to give a clean line for sideburns or under the nose.Immediately after my shave I had a five o'clock shadow, which was promptly cleaned up by shaving AGAIN with my Mach 3.What's next from Gillette? 20 blades to remove the first layer of skin and gouge out the hair folicle? Perhaps reshape your jaw bone to give you that \"Executive Look\" ?\nIs this product review negative?",

One thing that really annoys me about these 60s-70s directors, who went on about \"changing the world\", when they were younger, but who are now more money-grabbing than the worst studio system.

I have turned into an \"Armchair Everest Junkie\". Lene's perspective on her survival was of particular interest to me because I am such a chicken when it comes to taking risks. This book was more about who Lene liked and who she thought little of. There was very little credible information that shed light on what she went through. I found it distasteful that she took shots at those whom she accompanied and collectively staked their lives on the bid for the Everest summit. True, Anatoli was a fine mountaineer and human being but he was the only other person she respected.

When a film is touted as a \"must see film\" by movie critics, I'll remember this film and make sure I don't waste my time or money to see it. I wouldn't recommend renting this film for home viewing either. This film starts out depressing and I kept waiting for it to get better. This was just another vehicle for Hollywood to push homosexuality and lesbianism as a normal way of life. There was nothing in the previews or reviews to alert the public as to content and what they could expect if they went to see this film. I tried to find something in the film to keep me watching but gave up after 50 minutes and left along with several others. Walking out was refreshing after the doom and gloom I had just endured.",

Although I loved the first season, it was more of an introduction to the show than anything else. The second season allowed for more exploration of the characters and the story lines, and did so remarkably well.I never thought I would like a 'Sci Fci' show, but this really isn't. It's not more 'out there' than Lost or Fringe or any of the other shows on basic networks. I would recommend it to everyone.\nAnswer:",

It is impossible to read about Frank Wells and not desire to have met him. His relationship with Dick Bass reminded me of \"The Odd Couple\", and their humorous adventures propel the reader throughout the book (the best is the 'almost frostbite' on Denali). But these two guys are also inspiring and it is hard to put down the book and not want to tackle those summits!",

Kaku mystifies physics and makes it look like some sort of cult which deals with surreal objects such as \"hyper-dimensions\" and \"warped space\" - whatever those things mean to the average person who hasn't completed his PhD in supersymmetry. Reading Kaku's book is similar to reading a science fiction novel or watching an episode of star trek - things that have nothing to do in practice with physics.

Many different characters and some unusual messages for a 30's film, with a cast of pros and great Cukor direction.

Inflating it was quick and easy since it has a built-in pump: you plug it in, turn it on and switch off when it's inflated enough for you. The only drawback is that the pump is really noisy - about the same as a loud vacuum cleaner - so you probably want to inflate the mattress before the rest of the household goes to bed.I had one guest a week, two weeks in a row, sleeping on it for several nights. Both found it comfortable and slept well on it. The extra height makes it feel more like a regular bed and less like you're camping out on someone's floor.Like all air mattresses, the air sucks heat from the body so the sleeper can get really cold; I've found the best way around this is to place a blanket or comforter on the mattress before you put the sheets on - this bottom blanket will insulate the person from the cold air.So far it's been great and I have no complaints.\nAnswer:",

Rusted Angel is just sweet, and I can see why some people would say this is their best album. Each one of their albums has something new and different to offer. This one is more all-out thrash than something like Expanding Senses which is a little more reigned in. There's really nothing more I can say about this album, except buy it.

The OXO warranty, which I have exercised on another product, is very impressive. If anything breaks, OXO will replace it promptly. Other reviewers that rated this set poorly should have sent their knives back.I have been using this set for over a year and could not be happier. It is true that there are better cutlery sets, but for a significantly higher price. I have had no problems with my MV-55's nor have other family members who own the same set. Other reviews state that the knives lost their edge, however with frequent sharpening (as should be done with all knives) they stay as sharp as the day they were purchased.\nIs this product review negative?",

        "Title: Typical Ridley...\nReview: Reading some of the other reviews of this book, I see that I'm not alone in thinking this while it makes for great sci fi/action movie material, it's not a particularly enjoyable read. I've read most of Ridley's work and as far as the character Soledad goes, she's a typical Ridley protagonist.When describing his books to someone who hadn't read him, I foudn myself saying \"you don't read him expecting everything to be all good in the end.\" His lead characters are almost never worthwhile as human beings, but the difference in this book is that it's actually easier to identify and sypathize with the primary antagonist, Vaughn. There's more logic behind his murderous actions than there is behind Soledad's.Like some other's have already said: it could be that Ridley is making a statement about bigotry and how it can infect anyone's mind. I just don't feel that Soledad is a character worthy of more than one book.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

It turns out beautiful scans of photographs and does an amazing job with 35mm slides and film negatives.I would have given the scanner a 5 star rating except that there were a few issues. The first is that a high end scanner such as this should have a Firewire pass through so that it can be part of a longer chain of devices. Secondly, I'm using the scanner on a Mac OS X machine and the software took a few tries before the entire package loaded. I also get some \"application unexpectedly quit\" when quitting out of the application. Lastly, although the results of the 35mm slide scans were fantastic getting up and running was a little less than intuitive.If you want a great general purpose photo scanner, don't hesitate on this one.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Instead of renting I decided to buy the Bostich 15 gauge. Excited to get to work I struggled a little to get the hang of loading the magazine. The magazine is plastic and has a bit of a unique loading procedure. Nothing like my Bostich brad nailer or my rough-in nailer. I finally filled it with nails and went to fire the first round...nothing. Checked the air pressure, hose and fittings. All was OK. Tried for 5 minutes and succeeded in firing maybe 3 nails, one every 15 tries. I took it back to Home D___t and got another one. Same model, same problem except this one fired once every 10 times.

In addition to the poor quality of materials, as others have stated - it's not designed very well - handle is too short and not angled enough. Its only semi-redeemable quality was having very stiff, scratchy bristles that, for what areas of my back I could reach with it, those areas felt sufficiently scrubbed. But who wants to scrub their backs with a moldy back scrubber, no matter how stiff its bristles are? Yuck!I will return this as \"defective\" as it certainly fits that criteria in my mind - anything that can't even hold up through the 30-day return period is pretty pathetic.\nAnswer:",

Her exploration, explaination, and fascination with the female body is evident in nearly every poem. The synonyms used for describing certain body parts adds a mysterious curiosity to her poems, as though touching on some unknown. At times the collection appears to be a testimonial of Olds herself. A testimonial to herself, her husband, her children, her father, and to life in general. All the poems fit nicely into their sections whether it was \"Blood,\" \"Tin,\" \"Straw,\" \"Fire,\" or \"Light.\" The transitional poems between each section also worked well in tying the collection together as a whole. I was impressed by the honesty and true feeling evident in each poem.

        "Title: Fun fantasy style imitator of Janet Evanovich\nReview: The show must go on. Least that has been the performer's credo, but when magician's assistants start disappearing--yes, almost on a nightly basis--Esther Diamond skips out on doing the 'disappearing act' in her current production. Instead she goes to work with 300 plus year old sorcerer, Max Zadok, to try and find who is making these women disappear. As the incidences pile up, Esther and Zadok acquire quite a team of helpers, including a crew of transvestites, a cowboy and a socialite magician. While this does make for a varied and interesting cast, there are far too many toss-off lines and too much repetitive dialogue. For those of you who have read Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels, \"Disappearing Nightly\" is definitely a pale copy. If you are into fantasy, go ahead and read the book, but add Evanovich if you want some truly hilarious mystery stories.\nIs this product review negative?",

I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book. If you haven't read it yet, you're in for a treat.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

I ordered it and was rewarded with a wonderful tale of hardship, compassion, and tragedy set in one of the most trying periods of our countries history. It was more novella than a book. Easily read in a few hours. It describes the strugles of two drifters seeking a piece of the American dream. One man, the leader, is bright and resourceful, the other is mentally challenged, but loved and cared for by his partner. The conclusion is classically Kane and Able.",

It's amazing that she went undiscovered for so long.I can't wait for her next album to come out. This girl is a true \"Class Act\"! She is here to stay, and I know that we can expect great things from her in the future.And contrary to what Simon said about Fantasia being the best he has heard on American Idol, well he needs to have his ears cleaned out because Kelly is the BEST!!!!\nIs this product review negative?",

The deeply weird all-male family is quintessential Americana dementia--the goony birthmarked hitchhiker, bulky Leatherface in his black tie, the frustrated father (\"Look what your brother did to the door!\"), and of course, the blood-hungry nearly dead Grandpa. Will you think I'm mentally balanced if I say that they evoke pity and sympathy as well as horror? They do! There is something undeniably bittersweet about them. The thwarted Leatherface swinging his chainsaw impotently through the air at sunrise on the highway at the end of the movie is one of the classic images of cinema. You must brave this movie. Any reluctance on your part will be redeemed.\nIs this product review negative?",

Pheonix is also really good, he plays his sadistic character with gusto, and if you know anything about the history of the Caesars you know they were usually stark raving mad....as for Harris, he was just an acting icon, and he steals every scene he is in. The film itself is beautiful, whatever you think of Ridley Scott as a director, he does know how to shoot a visually spectacular film, the openning battle scene is fabulous.

It had its moments, but they were few and far between. Basically the plot is about an Aquarius(A guy who manges the aqueducts of Rome) and a Volcano with a little romance mixed in. Very boring indeed.Premise: The entire story is about the aquarius and his quest to go to Pompeii to fix the aqueduct. Along the way he makes enemies, you don't really know why. He meets a girl, who he likes, but she comes and goes in passing. You meet one really bad guy, but he doesn't come across as really that bad. The main character instead comes off as a panzy woose.There is poor writing and very poor characterization. Each character is briefly described if at all. The ending comes off very fast, and not properly dealt with. In the last 1/8 of the book the mountain explodes, a round about rescue is performed, the bad guys dies and the girl rescued, the end.Avoid this book if possible.",

His characters don't interact, and their development is pointless. This book is fully 200 pages too long. How long can the demons of Hell just sit and stir to existence and still keep our attention? Not 250 pages! There are some good moments, such as the Succubus inhabiting the mouse, but they are few and far between. The premise of this novel was so very promising -- I was very excited to read it. And I was let down completely. Mr. Marano, please, next time you have a good idea for a story, please write a story, not an epic adventure of style.\nAnswer:",

In addition to the normal specs for these devices, I particularly liked the commercial skip, its low standby power level, and its 5-year battery backup.But the TV Guide is truly a deal-breaker. In the week I had my unit, it literally chattered continuously as it tried (with only partial success) to download the guide. It was very irritating in an otherwise quiet room, and quiet passages in music or TV programs are a thing of the past with this in the same room.I emailed Pioneer; they said it is normal for the unit \"to make some sound\" when it is on, and the TV Guide cannot be disabled.If it worked well, the TV guide would be nice, but it isn't worth the racket. If I could have disabled the TV Guide, I would have kept the unit and programmed it manually.I reluctantly returned the recorder.\nAnswer:",

It was way too predictable. The story (of all these spies) *is* interesting, it's just too bad that Willig could not come up with other possibilities to tell the reader who the spy was. In the end, there was no twist, and the ending actually left me unsatisfied. No, I won't spoil it and tell you who is the Carnation, you will find out yourself when you read it. And no, I will not read the follow up of the book, The Masque of the Black Tulip.Despite this, Willig's writing is quite enjoyable, and the book reads very easily.

It started rotating again but the rotation got slower by the second and shortly after, it stopped completely! It seems to me that the power generator isn't strong enough to rotate the big ball!

And why? because she gets a divorce from a guy who apparently is having a midlife crisis??? or is it because she packs up and heads off on a gay holiday provided by two lesbian friends?...But this is how she finds the abode of her dreams!.....Actually more like a nightmare.I think it is a film that deserves the accolades it has gotten, but not because it would only be appreciated by 'chicks', but by anyone who loves Tuscany the way I do.The cast of characters in TUSCAN SUN was a study in why I love to sit and watch the parade go by when I travel. It is one of the facinating parts of travel for me.....locales are not the only thing exotic about it all.\nIs this product review negative?",

        "Title: Such a disappointment\nReview: After waiting, purchasing, and watching this movie I have no idea why it was granted the accolades it was. Peter Weir is a very good director but has little to work with as Crowe goes beyond character and tries to utter failure to not be a part of the movie but be the movie itself.In Weir movies often the landscape becomes a character in and of itself - think for instance of Picnic at Hanging Rock. However here he loses this advantage and opportunity. I know that the Hollywood money men make decisions to formula but keeping Weir from creating the landscape character of the ship and sea is really inexcusable.A universally poor cast and script lead this film into the depths of mediocrity which is such a shame.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

        "Title: Different Recast on Aristotle's and Adler's work\nProduct review: The book is a recast of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics which was summarized ih Mortimer Adler's Time of Our Lives. What James O'Toole does well is to weave his personal story and struggles with these issues in a language and context of today. I found this personal view refreshing and move Aristotle's theory to a very practical level. The book is clearly aimed at baby boomers, like himself, who are struggling with meaning and unfulfilled career aspirations. Personally, O'Toole's writing got me to think more about the question of whether all vices are \"fun and exciting\" and all virtue is \"boring\". The book is easy to ready and allows one to access easily Aristotle's important writings. I recommend it for anyone struggling with these issues.P.B.Boston, MA\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

This isn't a great film, it isn't even really a good film, but it can be entertaining if you like violence and mambo.The story behind the movie is weak at best and the cast (consisting mostly of Ice-T and Christopher Lambert) really doesn't do much to improve the film. There are some interesting action moments, all to the beat of Mambo music.If you can find it for a cheap price I'd suggest it, but I wouldn't pay any more than a couple of bucks for this film. Of course if you're a diehard Christopher Lambert fan or if you really love Mambo and Violence, this might be something you want to invest in.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

I was so disgusted with how Anne of Green Gables The Continuing Story lacked so many elements that made the first two so wonderful. This movie came out 13 years after the second movie and the characters not only have aged but have changed so much. It is not at all interesting for the audiences dedicated to the first two. However, on the other hand, if I were to view this one with no connection to the first two it would be okay. I was just not interested enough to watch the third one again or own it because it is so different with dramatic changes and the characters or scenes do not grab your attention.\nAnswer:",

Usually when the power goes out it is raining or snowing so you def. need your sub pump. Overall works great, keeps its charge a long time and you can keep it charging constanty without worrying about reducing the life of te battery. If you need more power you can also hook the jumper cables up to another battery and there you go more battery power. A++ 28aH battery with AC-DC converter, small light and AM/FM radio built in.

The sad fact of the matter is, that none of the tracks are particularly outstanding and understandably, they did not result in David Jones or his colleagues being catapulted into the limelight. However, if, like me, you are a fan of Bowie, then it could be no more than a bit of harmless fun to add this package to your collection.Incidentally, all the tracks crop up on various compilations which emerge from time to time, so unless you are a completist, it may be best to search around for a more complete compilation.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

The subplot of a power struggle that involves the sabotage of Kay's career by computer- was straight out of Postmortem. Kay's identifying a genetic disorder in the villian by a description of how he smells, straight out of Postmortem again. The final showdown as the killer invades Kay's home aftr she stupidly opens the door- straight out of Body of Evidence. And pretty close to the final scene in Postmortem. Frankly, its an insult to the readers memories- the only new thing here is the younger man/older woman romance and thats a pretty minor part of the book since the character development of the man is so shallow. Don't waste your time reading this, Postmortem tells the same story but does an infinitely better job. In that book the characers are fairly well developed and likable, here all the characters are just pale shadows of their incarnations in previous works.\nIs this product review negative?",

Although i think it was a really well executed plan to bring two very controversial, easily manipulated youngsters to our ears. Musically the album is pretty good and the songs show some degree of emotion, i think the vocals are grating at times but that's all down to taste. \"How soon is now?\" is a very tame effort, which was a song written by \"The Smiths\" in the 80s. The record company wanted to produce easily digestable pop and it succeded. You'll love the songs just long enough to go out and buy the album which will be forgotten in a couple weeks of listening. If you think you've created a special emotional bond with the fore metioned artists think again, they don't even understand what their singing (They Don't speak English) Vocals are dull and unemotional. :)\nIs this product review negative?",

And then there is Patrick Swazee. I never truly appreciated him, but have developed a respect for his talents, both as an actor and as a dancer. \"Dirty Dancing\" is a rollicking, coming of age film, in which Jennifer Gray is perfectly cast as \"Baby.\" We see the arc of her character, first as the tentative \"daddy's girl,\" and finally as the free-thinking woman she has become.

When I clean it I get dirt all over myself (I don't understand this bag less vacuum craze, while it is environmentally friendly, it is in no way convenient or pleasant) To top it off, the burning smell that others have reported is something I have experienced as well. I would not waste the money, it is a very cheap quality vacuum and has a short life.If I had another suggestion I would gladly give it. I do not have a lot of experience purchasing a vacuum, I can only assume it is worth doing a little research and investing more money.\nAnswer:",

It had lots of interesting details when it told about each memory that The Giver gave to Jonas. It had lots of description when it said, that the Giver was going to give Jonas a memory of the war. They give a good description of it, they talk about the blood, guns and people dying. It was full of feelings when it said that Jonas asked his parents if they loved him. One quote was, \" Do you love me?\" Jonas said. His parents said that love doesn't exist anymore. As a result, The Giver is a good example of good literature.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

Basically, the game is exactly what you'd expect... it's a sim/strategy type game where you take the role of a zoo keeper, and build your ideal zoo. With dozens of animals, from African hunting dogs to saltwater crocodiles to Asian black bears, this game should appeal to any wildlife enthusiast. The whole goal of the game is to make sure your animals, and guests, are happy. The former is achieved by placing them in a suitable environment, the later by building animal house (like 'reptile houses,' 'primate houses,' etc), resturants, gift stores and other attractions. You can choose several scenarios, from free form games to pre-made games that require you to achieve certain, increasingly challenging, goals. Over all, a very cool game, and one you can get cheaply too. But it will still provide hours of enjoyment. Go for it!\nAnswer:",

I applaud the author's goal, courage and tenacity. I loved the main character, Tom.That said, the writing style is not for me. I'm too spoiled by modern authors' constraints of being direct and succinct.I understand that in the culture of the time, a female author would find it necessary to obviate, to beat around the bush in making her (socially activist) point in order to comply with expectations of politeness and humility, to include occasional flattery of the opposition to make the novel more palatable to a wider audience and thus further her underlying goal.

When the cup was lifted, the timer would reset. Also, when the cup was lifted, the warmer would shut off until the cup was replaced on the warmer.

Given the overall flatness of the base image, it was obvious that the transfer was from the original negative, or internegative (IP/IN). There is extreme noise in the shadows, manifested by a breathing oscillation in those areas, as if the Criterion/DI colorist was working with bad calibration parameters and either deliberately or unwittingly jacking up the shadows to an extreme - and artificial - level.It is unwatchable.I would have given it a rating of zero stars, but that was not an option in the dropdown textbook.What is wrong with Criterion, anyway? Their black-and-white transfers (SEVENTH SEAL and 8 1/2) are utterly sublime. On my Pioneer Elite Kuro plasma I feel as if these films have that wonderful motion picture film-theater look-and-feel.

Nonsense.Will Smith Fresh Prince'd his way through the movie, weaving his Audi and/ or his motorbike through some of the larger gaps in the plot (who has their house demolished once they die? What the heck was that all about other than an excuse for Smith to escape/ defeat - once again - the robots). You hate robots for saving you? You sleep with a large, presumably loaded gun in your hands? You are a maverick cop? Come on, guys, this is awful.

Neil Marshall first made his mark on \"Dog Soldiers\", another excellent film, and the direction here was even more fantastic. The all-female cast was perfect, just spot-on, and the creatures both looked and acted like no others I have ever seen. The gore was immense, absolutely amazing, you will do yourself a favor by picking up the unrated version of the film. This movie is beyond your typical hack n' slash horror film, the characters are so greatly fleshed out you really get a chance to know and become attached to them.

The MP3 format has a flaw which means some silence is always present at the end of a song.

Pepper were much worse) but it's also not as good as Abbey Road or A Hard Day's Night.Those who claim this album is \"raw\" and \"emotional\" are off base. It's far from raw with the overlay of Phil Spector. And given the fact the four Beatles were rarely in the studio together as this was being done, don't criticize Phil. Without him these would still be unspliced demo tapes. Let It Be, Get Back, and Long and Winding Road are good. Which brings up my final point. No wonder John disliked this album. He didn't contribute anything decent to it.If you're building your collection, focus on Abbey Road as the final album.2 stars.\nAnswer:",

While reading \"Mere Christianity,\" I could not help being impressed with his persuasive writing style and heart-felt conviction. Upon closer inspection, however, subtle ambiguities come to light. Though they are too numerous to mention here, suffice it to say that Lewis relies on emotion rather than logic and empiricism to reach his \"logical\" conclusions. On the positive side is his irreproachabe sincerity: C.S. Lewis is one of the few men who give Christians a GOOD name. Regardless of his faith, he was a lion of a man and scholar, and his kind is sorely missed. Too bad he, like so many others, preferred comfort to the Truth.\nAnswer:",

His wanderings through his childhood were less than engaging - possibly because they were no more or less interesting than most of my own. In fact I have a couple of friends with truly exciting childhoods whom I can recommend before he writes his next book.

I read the fourth book and I was disapointed on the focus of constant sex and how much of a heroine Ayla was. The fifth book, sadly, follows in this pattern.Not only is there an *extreme* amount of sex, but Ayla being 'accepted' seemed forced. And the fact she keeps discovering things upsets me. Flint, 'spear-thrower', sewing, taming animals, ect, it's just very overdone.Ayla has no real flaws, which I think, is a huge problem when reading this story, as the reader has nothing to identify with.I've heard people talk about a story about Durc and what happens to him.

One problem with assembly - namely the insulation basket for the top is too small to fit as it should. Other than that the grill is easy to assemble.Main gripe is grill will not get over 400 degrees F. Left it on for a long time and the hottest it will go is about 420, which drops when food is put on. Not the best temp. for searing or real grilling.UPDATEIt gets worse - after 5 or so uses the grill now only gets to 300 F, by next week I won't be able to boil water. BTW, the grill sits on a 4th floor deck, West facing, in Florida, and is used in the evening when the deck is HOT and pounded by the sun - still will not heat up to over 300 now.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

I guess it was kind of a meditative aid during that time. It helped me to focus outside my body instead of on the contractions. I would actually count on the next note to appear just before it did. I don't know if I could even do that now. So, this was the first music my son ever heard in his world outside the womb.My husband uses it now to rock/walk our son to sleep each night.",

Kurt Russel gives a brilliant performance as an automaton struggling toward human awareness. His ability to convey a broad range of emotion and turmoil - without words - makes this film riveting, as his acting enters your awareness at the speed of light, not sound. The range of nuances the viewer can percieve on his visage deepen the impact of the emotional growth he experiences so nakedly before us.Although likely thought of as an action film, I find \"Soldier\" an uplifting and hopeful study in the desire of one man, stripped emotionally bare as a child, to recover a life that he has never known, yet yearns for.\nAnswer:",

        "Title: Intense scythe\nProduct review: Although this album is not a heavy listening experience, in that there are no heavy metal type of sounds, there are screeching violins that are just as disturbing. The song Heroin is an attempt to reconstruct the musical feeling of taking heroin and the attitude towards it, the most scything feeling on the entire album. Sometimes they sound like the Byrds and sometimes they sound like the Stones but the sound is original in its energetic impact. Seems as if there were so many modern musical masterpieces released in 1967...yes this is one of them and worth its place on anybody's must listens.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Bought before going on vacation, & called the store upon my return to complain. They said, \"That is just Sony's way of making you buy a separate charger.\" After several months of hassles, I notified Sony about my dissatisfaction with this, & their customer service rep sent me a smart-alec reply by e-mail.

It enthralled me from the start, and has never let me go. The aspect of the book I like most is the elegant use of language. The descriptions are vivid but not overdone; the book washes over you with serenity, much as Shangri-la does over Conway. The only quibble I have is that the American character, Barnard, talks like a British version of an American, and so is unconvincing to this Idahoan. (Yet how many times have we Americans done the same thing to British sensibilities?) In summary, I have read the book a dozen times over the years, coming back to it like an old friend, and will probably read it a dozen times more.\nIs this product review negative?",

A great book which could have been a great movie, but never achieved the promise of the cast, or story. I was really looking forward to the film being a \"constant reader\" as Mr. King calls us, to the conflict between good and evil, the Duddits connection (from watching the movie you have no idea of what the connection between him and the other boys/men was). The story line was choppy, trying to fill in the gaps with a few flashback scenes, you never really got the point that Mr. Gray had taken over one of the friends, (they had to have a character tell you this so you knew what was happening). The lack of detail in the second half of the movie was confusing, and the new ending was a disappointment.",

        "Title: Still one of the funniest films I've ever seen.....\nReview: Gaz (Robert Carlyle) and Dave (Mark Addy) are a pair of unemployed Yorkshire steelworkers with problems. Gaz is about to lose custody of his son, Nathan, for non-support and Dave believes he's about to lose his wife after he sees her at a local club ogling the Chippendale's.Schemer Gaz comes up with a plan to get back their money and their self-esteem. They can be strippers, too. It doesn't matter if neither is that attractive or can dance, they can learn. Of course, Gaz has to up the ante by declaring the act will be 'the full monty.' (Nude)How these two recruit a teacher and a team of fellow dancers is a laugh-a-minute ride. How they relate to each other and grow, brings a brief tear to your eye. Dialog, acting and setting are fascinating. The soundtrack is also great disco fun.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

I suppose the anticipation for something special and enlightening only served to set me up for a complete letdown, and that is exactly what best describes this utter waste of my precious time. There's no denying that Bruce Thomas is a superlative bass player...but as a writer, he just should not have bothered. I suspect this trash was induced by an overindulgence in halucinogenic dabbling. He appears to be an unappreciative and bitter soul. Such a pity for such a talented musician. But I will grant you this, I never was a big fan of the British low-brow sense of humor to begin with...I just don't get it. Benny Hill, Monty Python, all that garbage must be viewed on a good strong buzz to be appreciated in any way. So my recommendation is this...if you are going to bother reading \"The Big Wheel,\" roll yourself a large one first.Sir Clyde Crashcup\nAnswer:",

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product?\nReview title: so bad that it's...really awful\nProduct review: The dual billing of Arnold Stang and Arnold \"Strong\" is the first hint to this film's cult legacy. Old-timey comedian Arnold Stang and the future gubernator team up in this hammy and cheesy fish-out-of-the-Mediterranean film from 1969. Most of the supporting cast is made of petrified wood, though veteran actor James Karen was somehow enticed into this Z-grade effort. Horrible production values approach the night-as-day scenes inImpulse, including car horns evident on Mount Olympus.It would be eight more years before Schwarzenegger made a proper introduction to audiences inPumping Iron, and I suppose there is a certain charm in seeing the big guy for the first time. But Hercules in New York would really only be worth watching with snarky commentary. The only reason I didn't rate it one-star is because of the laugh factor. But the laugh factor isn't high enough. The pity factor, on the other hand, is off the charts.",

I'm sorry -- I know that by critical accord he's one of the finest and most influential of all English writers. And I understand the important work that he did in publicising social justice causes such as child labour. But I find his prose ornate and contrived, his plot slow-moving and predictable, and his characters implausibly one-dimensional. In my opinion Dickens does not pass the test of time.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

For a film that was made in 1977, a time when the quality of animation was already in sharp decline, the artwork and scenes are quite superb.Though I would like to have seen more than just 78 minutes portrayed on the screen, this version, nonetheless, is a good series of highlights from the story, itself. Also noteworthy is that the transition from one scene to the next was done in such a way that the characters, both individually and as a group, were easy to identify and remember.If you are looking for good-quality entertainment for nearly all ages, The Hobbit is highly recommended. For the audiophiles out there, there is neither Dolby nor DTS stereo surround sound, for the release is presented only in mono. Nonetheless, it is a worthwhile purchase.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

The two ongoing stories were handled in a unique and entertaining manner.I will watch this DVD over again and enjoy it many times in the future.

While the transfer isn't terrible, you do hear typical record noise which is really dissapointing. Add in the \"low budget\" packaging and lack of licensing information, I have to question the legality of this one.Still, you can't beat the price and if you don't want to take the time to burn your LP to a CD (or if you can't find a copy of the LP) this will do.

Michael Carrodus' vocals have an Ian Curtis appeal and fit the songs well. The lyrics and keyboards keep the whole thing firmly ensconced in eighties new wave/goth. Half of these songs would do well on college radio.Their cover of Death In June's \"Fall Apart\" breathes new life into the song. \"Black Roses\" strikes the best balance among my-woman-is-heartless lyrics, 80s-era synth drums, and Mission UK melodies. \"Suicide\" is the standout mood piece, slow and dirgy though the singing and lyrics are weak. If you haven't eaten a bullet after that song, \"Love Is Colder Than Death\" is actually a pretty peppy tune.After Carrodus left to seek new heights of obscurity, Ikon went in a more electronic direction. \"In The Shadow of The Angel\" is a good introduction, and a solid \"B\" in goth pop.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

It wasn't until I was halfway through the book that I discovered it was written in 1969, almost 35 years ago. That is how well this book has held up: it reads like a fresh story. And smooth. That is the word that comes to mind: the writing in THE BIG BOUNCE is smooth. It flows and moves along easily. Maybe the best writing I've read of Elmore Leonard's works and I've read many. It's a subdued, subtle story with a great fight scene and a tense house B&E scene. It features Jack Ryan, maybe a little slow en la cabeza but who can swing a bat (or a tree limb) and knows a 100 ways to break into a house, and Nancy as the ambitious rich guy's GF who is more than a little psychotic. Rather than a roller coaster ride of plot twists, this novel is like like a fine vintage wine to be savored and enjoyed on the veranda with a good cigar.

I agree that HP support is completely worthless - that's if you can even get them to understand what your problem is since it may not be in their \"manual\".Anyone have a suggestion on a decent brand that will do incredible scans of old photos and not fail in the first two years??",

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product?\nReview title: Clan of the Cave Bear\nProduct review: This is a truly touching book, in which you follow the life of Ayla, a girl born to the \"Others\", who is found by Iza, the top medicine woman of the Clan( aka cave people). You explore the feelings of the characters. Auel has created a wormhole into the past. Each character is distinct in itself, and you have a story outline both dramatic and explicit. When Creb\\ Mog-ur performs his ceremonies, you feel as if you are there. It's like watching a movie, only deeper. You explore the humiliation of Creb's deformaty, the stubborness of Broud, and the kindness and caring of Iza. When Ayla is discovered to be hunting against the Clan laws, you plead along with her against the death curse. This is a truly wonderfull book. There are some mature parts, so if you don't feel you can handle them, don't try. Once again, I strongly reccomend this book!",

        "Title: A never tiring book to be read and reread.\nReview: A Max Lucado classic. From an author who can take the simplest of simple and expose the deepest of meaning. This childrens book is a must for a childs nightstand to be requested and rerequested night after night. A story on how the least likely of canidates can play the most important rolls in God's creation. How, no matter what seems our position in life, God can use each of us in His kingdom. This book parallels many stories in the bible but mostly reminds me of how He took the least of 7 brothers and used him as a King(David). It is a comfort and joy and should be read by every parent to their children.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

The player movements and mechanics are some of the best i've seen in a sports game.DEAD are the days where a player is attached to the ball as they run... now the ball has its own speed and force and the player needs to be careful or else it'll get away from them.A bit hard to get a hold of the shooting at first- but it's no harder than real life I'd say. Good level of customization and nicely detailed leagues with plenty of info.Highly recommended!",

        "Title: so disappointed!\nReview: I, like so many other James Patterson/Alex Cross fans, was anxiously awaiting this book, the next chapter in the life and career of Alex Cross. I was so disappointed in the lack of development of this book! It had a weak premise, the characters lacked development, the actual \"dirty deeds\" were not even entertaining much less interesting, and even the personal story line of our favorite detective was, again, under developed. It was almost as if James Patterson had a ghost writer who just didn't get the personality of the key players nor the angle of suspense that Patterson himself has been known to deliver. I can't imagine anticipating the sequel. I know that as a loyal fan I will probably read it, if for no other reason than to hope that the return of the core Cross family will be more developed and realistic than in this book, but I look forward to the book after that when this story can be put to rest and, hopefully, the true James Patterson will again emerge.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

Imagine a dozen Clouseau's bumping into each other as they all accidentally rob the same bank.I haven't seen the other Clouseau flicks recently enough to remember if they all were like this, but this G-rated flick had enough gay innuendo to almost consider that this was brilliantly hidden subversive material.

This is cartainly a different sounding Roberto Alagna that I have ever heard. His middle is muddy and his top doesn't ring like in the past. I like the selection of songs including a song he wrote for this album. Not all the arrangements are tradtional (some even being on the ridiculous side) and maybe this makes his efforts a little tainted. In the liner notes Roberto comments on his approach to some of the songs. He admits he tries to sound like a pop singer (i.e. White Christmas-what a butcher job). On other songs he was a tenor. Even that doesn't add up to much. Tenor fans and Alagna fans will be very disappointed with his singing. I was. This album will let him iclude himself as one of the elading tenors in the post Domingo/Pavarotti/ and Carreras era. His Sacred Aria album is much better than this one.",

I own most if not all of Alan Jackson's albums. I couldn't believe my ears. Alan Jackson should apologize to his fans for this one. The title should have been \"LIVIN' ON MY NAME.\" This album also provided an answer to the question of \"WHO'S CHEATIN' WHO.\" In fact, Alan deserves a call and a visit from Roy D. Mercer. This is the worst country music album I have purchased in 35 years. Pass on this album.",

Christina's dance troupes are good and musicians have performed well too but Christina's singing isn't good. She has sung out of tune at a few places. I don't think she's at par with Celine Dion or Mariah Carey as I thought earlier.

Personally, I thought that was probably the best of the sequels since it picked up where the first left off and brought it to a new area. But if there had to be one problem with this one it would be with that one doctor since she did not want to listen to the kids and the ending result of that was that half the kids were killed. Also it seems that in every movie that there is always one or two interfering grown-ups and it always comes to the same thing and that is they've got to go against the clock before that character is killed. There were some really good parts in the film I thought that some of the best scenes in this were when they were showing off their powers, and I liked the fight between their doctor and Freddy's skeleton, as well. All in all, I found this one to be really good. Check this one out, you won't be disappointed.\nAnswer:",

Both movies are romantic and show the beauty of a simpler life. In the Continuing Story, Anne is not the young, attractive lady she once was and Gilbert has lost much of his handsomeness. Anne has a romantic intanglement with a Jack Garrison and it seems as though she is shown more with Fred Wright than with her beloved Gilbert. This moving is not heartwarming and sweet like its predecessors, but haphazard in plot. I do not recommend this movie to anyone wishing to see a clean movie, as it is sprinkled with sexual innuendoes.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

The DC removed much vital information, like the background to the exchange when Decker is picked up to be forced back into work as a BR. The DC also inserted an idiotic scene of a unicorn trapsing through a glade - looked like it was lifted directly from \"Legend.\"I would venture that some preponderance of the intelligentsia expressing preference for the DC saw the OV first, thus they have already been exposed to the background info before seeing the DC. If you see the DC first, good luck. I wouldn't recommend seeing the DC at all. The OV is one of my favorite films. I resent that people who feel they know what the rest of the population's tastes \"should\" be have determined which version we may view.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

        "Title: Features menu locks up Blu Ray player\nReview: First, all of the episodes play fine. They look great in Blu Ray. 5 Stars for the show, however, the disk menu functionality leaves much to be desired. This is the first Blu Ray disk playback issue I've had w/ player Sony BDP-BX38 - whose firmware is up to date. \"BD Live\" and most of the \"Features\" lock up the player, which then has to be restarted. So, I guess this review's as much of a slam on Sony as it as on Warner Home Video. Apparently, BR development isn't all that commonized yet. My options are- wait it out and hope that Sony's next update fixes the issue or to exchange the blu ray for DVD. Undecided.\nIs this product review negative?",

But their talent is wasted in this film. The script is pretty standard stuff, though the ending did have a decent twist. (however, if you pay attention you will catch on well before the climax). The scenery is beautiful, marred only by the plagues infesting this small town.AnnaSophia Robb, who play little Loren McConnell, is a lovely child, with very captivating eyes, but again she is wasted here.The movie isn't bad, but it falls prey to cliche's of this genre'. And that is another problem...it doesn't really fit into a specific mold. It isn't horror, not really suspense, not quite mystery....so it had the potential to be great, but it was one cliche after another.Too bad, because this isn't a type of movie we see often, and it was full of talented actors, but if you have a slow, rainy two hours you could certainly do worse.\nAnswer:",

I love a flawed hero and Christian, the Duke of Jervalux, delivered! Like a more recent Christian, Flower's Christian was also a tortured, mentally messed up soul who behaved and loved violently. But, unlike 50 Shades of Grey, the Duke shined in his transformation. By the nature of his affliction he had to learn and grow, and watching his character arc up from the dregs of lunacy, solitude, abandonment, and ridicule was heart-breaking, gripping, awe-inspiring and just wonderful reading!...Maddy got on my nerves in the middle.

But unlink most other Grisham novels, this isn't in the viewpoint of a lawyer, judge or client--despite the title. The view from the editor/jouralist looking at a grisley rape/murder over many years is unique.The one criticism I have is some of the plot twists (away from the rape/murder case which is the focus of the book) you could see a mile a way. Grisham is at his best when dealing with crime and the law. Not so much with everyday human life and relationships.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

The Twist-top lock prevents any ADDITIONAL liquid from escaping; however after you've taken a sip, residual liquid sits in the 360 degree slits. Even when locked that portion will spill everytime. This mug does NOT hold its contents Hot as long as my Starbucks version; although it does outlast the plastic travel mugs. With so many holes to drink out of, when you get to the bottom of your cup and tip it up, your coffee starts to pour out too many holes and ends up going around your mouth and down your chin. I work in a dusty environment and like the flip top mugs because it actually protects the drinking area from getting dirty. The twist top locks the drink from under the lid, so any dirt or dust sits on the entire drinking area and is always exposed. This will do the job, but there's many other options that I would prefer.\nAnswer:",

After they list the kanji, first they list the onyomi, then the compounds, and then the kunyomi (each set is seperated by a marker on the left hand side). For those who don't know kanji too well, the onyomi is the reading used when the kanji is used in a compound. The kunyomi is used when the kanji is by itself, or with certain okurigana (certain hiragana or katakana that goes along with the kunyomi).\nAnswer:",

I thought maybe it wasn't placed correctly and didn't depress the activation button, gave it a few more tries but it never worked well.With the unpredictability of this product, between fire-starting the other reviews have stated and not even doing a darn thing in my case, I wouldn't get it.

We used a camcorder that their parents owned, and used their back yard as our set. Ketchup was blood. Ikari is several orders of magnitude better than what we produced. That does not mean that this is a good film, however. The narrative is not bad. The rest is. I am a fan of anime, and in the context of anime, this doesn't measure up, despite the creators' best intentions. I feel like I could have done something better with the eighty or so minutes I spent watching. Sorry, I had high hopes. Fans of anime looking for a live action approach should try the subtitled version of Kung Fu Hustle. Yes, it's produced by a big studio with a lot of money, not a noble indie film maker.

        "Is this product review positive?\nTitle: Not mind blowing at all\nReview: Maybe I expected too much from this book. I thought this book could give me more insight into the dangers of statistical interpretations or the wrongful use of statistics. This book didn't help me at all with that. It's all very (very) basic stuff people should watch out for, when using statistics. Most of this I already knew. I think for anybody who has already red a book from Nicholas Taleb (or anything alike) this book will not present any new material.To people completely new to statistics, this book might be helpfull, but to those who frequently use statistics for their jobs or in their free time, this book won't add any value. There are much better books on statistics out there.\nAnswer:",

Everyone was turning in a \"performance\" - if you could call it that - for the paycheck. And no wonder. There is more sex and graphics on television than in this yucky pile of. . . Yes, sometimes the actors are partially nude, but you really don't see anything at all - and who cares by the way - but everything looks so fake you can't believe it. No one kisses at all.

This program is not about financial riches, it is about giving us a road map for success in all aspects of our lives (health, wealth, communication, relationships, growth and development, faith and more). The 17 success factors were explained in great detail with examples so we can put them to work immediately. If you travel this program is ideal for listening on the road.

The story centers around the strange, always hungry detective from the first two films, \"L\". This time, he gets involved with a plot by some crazies to release a bio-weapon that will kill millions. But the clock is ticking in more ways than one: L only has a few weeks to live due to his writing his own name in the Death Note book. In my opinion, this film is just as good as the first two and is a great end to the whole story arc. Fans of Asain cinema will love this one as well as those who rarely watch these types of movies.",

This is the worst first person narrative I've ever read. And I've read a lot, trust me. The narrator and plot are flat, flat, flat. My feeling about this novel and the narrator was who cares? If you want to read about adolescent angst don't waste your time with this - read or reread \"Catcher on the Rye.\" The few times Holden rants about prep school will tell you all you need to know. What a waste of money! This was such a dull read I don't even want to torture anyone by giving it away.\nIs this product review negative?",

Al of which were explained in the other books.THERE WAS VERY LITTLE ACTION EVENTS IN THE WHOLE BOOK. It dragged on and on. The next time I buy a tape version I will get the abridged version. Maybe that will cut out all the stufff Jean told us in the first 5 books. Based on the other books, especially the first three books, I was extremely disappointed in this last book. I can honestly say I would not reccomend this book for others to waste their time on reading it.Fred Davis\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

He was so nutty and surreal, and yet he was grounded in reality, and worked between the lines with that aspect. \"Joon\" was crazy, yet lucid in unique ways that enabled her to see the weaknesses in others and know the why of it. The \"sane person\", Benny, was the one who was least 'in touch' with what was really going on in life, although on the surface it would seem that he was the normal one, who was able to do things \"right\", to function the way society says that we must.

Let me start with some pithy one-word descriptions: awful, terrible, dreadful, tasteless, offensive, abominable, horrid, atrocious, appalling. There must be more, but I've run out of adjectives for the moment.What I really can't understand is why anyone would make a movie for kids (PG-13 is still in that category), which includes so many explicit sexual references (masturbation, oral sex, and so on). It certainly isn't funny for adults, and kids either won't get it, or if they do, will merely be made uncomfortable. (They will look at you with that special expression that means, \"How am I supposed to react to this?\" You will not be laughing, which will give them a hint.)In short, this film had no redeeming qualities whatsoever.\nAnswer:",

This baby-dry theme is also very true because it holds a lot with out giving her any redness. Also, since its now flexible on the legs, its even much better for my baby girl to move around with it. In addition, I do highly recommend to subscribe to the amazon subscribe and save program. I don't have to worry about carrying a big box of pampers at the store, especially all the room it took on my grocey cart!! and at the same time watching my daughter. Now I get it delivered to my door, monthly, with free shipping and at a great price, ..WHAT MORE CAN I ASK FOR??

Not enough direction, basically a disembodied voice telling you to clear your mind, sweep thoughts away, think of sunsets and beaches .. but not much direction as to how. If it was that easy to clear one's mind, we'd all be sleeping. The main track was not long enough to put me to sleep and having to get up to increase the volume on the last two tracks destroyed any beneficial effects from the first tracks. The volume drop on the subsequent tracks, with the stated intention to not disturb you if you are sleeping after the first one, doesn't work if you're not, makes it impossible to use the tracks consecutively.\nIs this product review negative?",

This book becomes the most monotonous of Stephen King's career. I have read all of his novels, and this is one of his worst. The only thing that saves it from being THEE worst (that honor still belongs to the overrated Christine) is the first 200 pages, which are gory, over-the-top fun. The rest of the book comes off as both trite and pretentious, at the same time. The characters are developed fairly well in the first 200 pages, and then go no where. The character of Kurtz is the ultimate cliche, and having him sucking up a large part of the last 200 pages was a BIG mistake. The extended chase at the end is tedious, not at all frightening, and turns a novel that started out excellent into an absolute disaster.",

Coming from my first handgun, it was a 12-shot Colt Mk4 that came with a spring rifle. Decided to get this handgun because I was getting sick with how difficult it was to fire my old handgun (after about 20-some shots it hurt the hands to continue pulling the slide to shoot). This handgun is still a single shot, but it's much easier to pull the slide back, which is surprising to see with how much power it packs behind every shot. The magazine size jumped from 12 shots to around 25, and I purchased a couple extra magazines that allow me around 75 shots before I need to reload everything. It's plenty accurate for the ranges I've used it in (something like 10-20 feet). Overall, a great sidearm to have for any airsoft shootout.",

Eddie Murphy has to be the most versatile actor around; I couldn't believe it was he in the part of the fading R&B star.

You'd be half right; while nothing to do with the 1983 classic, as post-apocalyptic soft-porn B-movies go, it's not at all bad. And, believe me, I've seen enough to know how bad it *can* get. Fortunately, CH3 is set in a future where fertiliser and guns are in short-supply, but civilization still has an abundant supply of thongs and hair-stylists. The plot/excuse has a village exchanging their nubile young girls with an evil (and disfigured, natch) man who runs the fertiliser mine. This peeves one of the boyfriends, who looks like Kyle McLachlan, but sadly possesses none of the quirky wit. Oh, and all teachers bar one have been exterminated.",

It's still a decent black comedy with Nicole Kidman as an absolutely wicked manipulator of a woman, but the laughs I remember just aren't there.I do enjoy the storytelling style. We all know what is going to happen (Kidman is going to hire her teenage lovers to kill he husband), so the director has a challenge of keeping the audience's interest until that point. This is accomplished by unfolding Kidman's career and rise to the top through a series of first-person narratives by the different characters in the story. It's almost as if the family members and friends are being interviewed by a TV news camera after the climax of the story, and the technique is very well done.If you like offbeat, dark cinema, give this one a shot, but don't expect award-winning drama.\nAnswer:",

A variety of editors speak openly and candidly about the publishing world -- what makes a best seller, what makes a winning nonfiction proposal, what they want (and don't want) from authors. From small university presses to powerful New York publishing houses, Judy Mandell conducts over 40 interviews and asks editors the questions I've always wanted to ask. How are advances determined?

I find the rest of the movie following suit to a lower level of humor where I think they either were trying to hard that they missed the boat or maybe not trying hard enough that the boat is a sinking ship.",

The raptors kill brontos, but a soft kick to the head by a fleeing human knocks them down? The special effects were terrible here and you can tell the actors don't know where to look cause they don't know where the CGI's are supposed to be.Minus 1 star for the whole Jimmy character/subplot. He has this special bond with some black dude and tries to prove himself by being brave. He can also shoot bugs that are crawling on someone, while shaking holding a gun, no problem. Jimmy should have been cut into deleted scenes.I also disliked: when a man swings on a vine with a gun, Kong shaking the girl violently and she has not a scratch, the girl walks like an egyption/juggles...wtf? Random vampire bat attacks on Kong.Overall, not a realistic movie. Has too many over the top moments where you ask yourself, \"how are these people still alive\".\nIs this product review negative?",

The London scenes weren't outdone until 28 Days Later and it has a number of things going for it, not to say the least a very sexy female lead that walks around naked for a good part of the movie.The story is a bit overexplaiend and there are a number of scenes where learned men talk intulectually about the events occuring that are a massive suspence killer. This is in addition to the fact that it is rather silly and silly should not be rationalised.I found it a lot worse than I had remembered but I am still glad I had a second look. But I do not recommend it to first time viewers except maybe those how migth be heavily into Vampires and Sci-fi - then it might just be worth a late night viewing.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

It is just the right size for pairing vegetables, cutting up a small piece of meat, or other general purpose tasks.

I've used bamboo and maple cutting boards, and I've found that the bamboo boards don't seem to retain as much odor as maple boards. They also wash very easily and are aesthetically pleasing. I love my Island Bamboo cutting board and would recommend it to anyone who wants a nice, light weight cutting board and doesn't like the feel of plastic.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

It was very creative and unique. I like how they explained the different jobs that everyone got. Jonas was my favorite character. At the beginning of the book,I thought that the title didn't fit the book until I got to about the middle. I wish that some of our city rules and laws were like that. I really enjoyed this book because I like reading fantasy books and you could tell that this one was. I makes me wonder if the future could\\will really be like this. The things that I didn't really like about it was that, It was alittle confusing at first but most books are. I also wish that there had been a more happy ending, and alittle more details on what happened next. I really did like enjoy this book and I would encourage you to read it too.\nAnswer:",

In one scene, Infante embraces a \"dead\" Blanca Estela Pavon. It's so haunting...and ironic as the real Pavon died a couple of years later! The harshness of time has not been kind to prints of this film. The credits look like they were made in 2007, not 1947! Infante does a sincere job singing the film's theme song; it can make one's eyes water. Still, this is a movie worth owning on DVD for less than $20.The title means 'When the Brave Cry'.\nAnswer:",

Therefore, use this book as a spelling guide, and ignore Riddick's constant characterizations of major and minor players in British India.

Basically you get two 5.5\"x12\" cedar blocks with three pre-drilled holes and then three slats which are about 1.5\" x 1/2\" with dowels on the end that fit into the pre-drilled holes. Basically a middle school shop student could make these without any problem.One of my slats came without the dowel and was not pre-drilled. It didn't come with any extra dowels so I had to improvise. The pieces were only mildly sanded and there was no sanding done at all to the exit side of the pre-drilled holes...long splinters and a pretty unfinished look.On the other hand, it is made of cedar which smells great and isn't cheap...but if you found a good deal on 1x cedar, you could easily make the equivalent product yourself.",

Hey, I thought, atleast I can finally find out some more of the storyline. Well apparently plot wasn't a priority in A Crown of Swords and neither was following up on the loose ends left over from the last novel. This book seemed to be more focused on pointless descriptions that have literally no place in this book and the more and more frequent sexual escepades. The story has sunk down to some awful soap opera, that like soap operas never seems to end. Well atleast the soaps have some intresting turns, but this book goes absolutely nowhere except for the last few pages where Rand just up and fights a Forsaken. Is Rand ever going to fight the Final Battle or is Jordan going to kick the bucket first?

He didn't get loose the second time. There's an allegorical tale for all us males right there.As has been mentioned in other reviews, these only trap the male moths. That cuts down on the reproduction rate but you still have to kill the females by hand. The traps might work better if the manufacturer had put a larger patch of the sticky stuff on the inside and the price is a little high but when used in conjunction with proper storage techniques, the traps will help you keep grain moths under control.\nIs this product review negative?",

I have slogged through the first 300 pages of this tome, and now it rests on the shelf. (Editing out reduncancies and there might be a worthwhile thirty page read here). In those first 300 pages nothing more exciting happens than a dirty trick involving clothing and a death at a hunt, providing I suppose a plot ploy to expose Ayla's healing powers. Not much high dudgeon here. Frankly, the book reads more like ... manual for the stone age then a tale fashioned by a writer who proved capable of excellence in her earlier works.`\nAnswer:",

        "Title: a good beginning\nReview: The Frames, if you can ever see them live, do, as they are one of the most amazing bands live. They can bring the volume down to a pin drop and up louder than a parker aircraft. This is their first album and like many band's first albums it features not only their sounds but the sounds of their influences. Not to say that it's necessarily a bad thing, but if you've come to love the Frames like I have, it's weird to go from their established albums back to this. The remastering job and bonus tracks are definitely a plus, I remember downloading this album back when it wasn't available and it just wasn't the same, with the remastering and bonus tracks it's worth having as it has more recent tracks than the album itself, if you can buy this first, then work your way up to the present as they have never put out a bad album.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

Those of you that love the earlier Sookie Stackhouse novels know what I mean. The quality of the early novels is so good and then there's that rapid decline in the quality of the stories. This is book 5 in the series and those thoughts have started creeping around in my mind. This book put my mind at ease. It's easily my favorite of the series so far. What a unique story putting a Dark Hunter and an Apolite as your main characters. It works so well. The chemistry between the two, especially at the beginning of the book, is just stellar. The story as a whole is fantastic. A Dark Hunter who no one can remember after 5 minutes and an Apolite princess who's life or death will destroy earth. Come on people! Read this book! It's awesome!\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Watching the film as an adult I noticed there's big a amount of sexual innuedno in this film the kind of humor that you have to be an adult to get. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd were in top form as the hero and villian in the film and we all know that the two best voice overs in the film were Charles Fleischer and Kathleen Turner. This is still one of favorite Zemekicks films so sit back and watch this for old times sake.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Its a scientific experiment on the audience. As the audience watches A Clockwork Orange, they are seduced into numerous violent scenes, each beatifully orchestrated by Kubrick.

She was several years younger than I, but basically matured during the same period of time. What really got to me was that I found it highly, if not extremely unlikely that a 22/23 year old in the late 70's would even consider keeping a child that someone left in her car. If she even had considered giving the child to the proper authorities I might have found it somewhat believable. If this did appear in the book it was soo brief to have escaped my notice. This issue somehow permeated my thoughts while reading the book and for that reason I couldn't involve myself to the greatest extent.Her writing style is interesting and poetic but give me a break. I still can't believe anyone, especially with her desire to start a new life, would have kept a child. Very unrealistic how the care of the child was underplayed.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

The trailer sure made it look like one, yet everything in the trailer came from the last third of the film. Every scene in the first half of the movie is so protracted I had to stop myself from yelling, \"GET HIM IN THE COLISEUM ALREADY!\" The film is well structured and a good story but there's not enough meat on this bone for a film well over two hours. And so it feels s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d with pretty visuals, pretension and unnecessary talk-talk-talk. If we could get a 90 minute cut of this on the DVD set, I'd buy and treasure it.

The receiver of memory holds all of the community's memories.Jonas goes on an adventure with a baby in his family unit(the baby's name is Gabriel).We thought The Giver was a bad book because it had a lot of complicated things that the author could have explained better. We didn't like the plot. It built up too slowly and ended too quickly.The book had too much stuff that didn't sound realistic.

When I lived in Salt Lake City, I had to learn to do that, because some people wouldn't take no for an answer. One furious Relief Society lady was so upset with my attitude of unbelief that she pointed to my dog and said, \"I suppose you think that dog is just as good as you are!\" I replied, \"Probably better.\" and THEN I shut the door and watched through the window as her embarrased husband tried to lead her down the porch stairs.

Burt Lancaster stars as an inmate who plans his escape to be with his critically ill girlfriend, Ann Blyth. He enlists the help of his cellmates and an older, experienced inmate, Charles Bickford. Standing in their way is a brutal, ambitious guard played very well by Hume Cronyn. There are a number of great scenes in the movie, including Cronyn's beating of an inmate to the sound of classical music, and the death in a giant press of an inmate that informed. The performances are good, the film moves at an excellent pace, and the ending surprised me somewhat, again given the time that it was made.

You'll feel as though she was just trying to fill pages.4 But most of all, there was no closure to the story in any satisfying way. That is paramount in a good crime book.In summary, don't bother.

The price is especially ridiculous when you consider that there are books three times as thick, with glossy photos and a real wealth of information about Paris overall, that cost less even before any discounts. I was sorely, sorely disappointed in this book, and I am returning it first thing Monday morning. I turned around and bought the Eyewitness guide instead, which gave me some real insight into Paris as a whole, and then for that black/African-American/African angle, I did some research on the Internet, which led me to find out about the Goutte d'Or neighborhood and various restaurants of interest.As much as I griped about the price, I think even if this book were priced in the $7 - $10 range, I would still give it one star or at the most, two stars. There is simply not enough information in here for it to be much of a guide at all.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

This book couldn't leave my sight for day's onto the end of night until I finished it. For me to see what this child has gone through, has my heart reaching out for others who are so much less fortunate. The reason why I picked The Child That Lives in a Man as my title is because there is always a little child living in each and everyone of us. That has gone through some kind of past like the child in the book has. Even as some might not be a bad as others, we have all been through basically the same thing.Thereason why I rate this book a four star is because it is so moving that your heart will want to reach out for others as well as mine did.",

I got interested in Costello because one of my favorite songs on Aimee Mann's \"Bachelor No. 2\" was co-written with Costello; the song is called \"The Fall of the World's Own Optimist\" and also because I heard this CD playing in a friend's place. In my novice opinion, this is a good starter for young beginning Costello fans like me. I knew a couple of the songs before; there were a few more I recognized but hadn't previously realized were by Costello; and the rest were good discoveries. My only gripes are not with the music; I just wish there was more in the liner notes than pictures. Well, maybe I'll spring for the import version some day...\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

And even now, very few of the songs are available as MP3's or on compilation albums. So I was *thrilled* two days ago when I saw that amazon was selling the cd at an affordable price.Then I got the CD and played it. Words cannot express my disappointment. The sound quality is abysmal, there's weird background noises, and worst of all, the vocal tracks are so buried in the mix that you can barely hear them. I am having *serious* trouble believing that this a legitimate release, and not some 5th generation bootleg copy churned out in somebody's garage.My advice: spend the extra money to get an used \"unremastered\" copy somewhere.

The first part of the book is divided into lessons, then there are three sample tests in the back.I thought the lessons were good, but not great compared to some of the other ASVAB books out there. The book did a great job of telling you upcoming changes to the ASVAB as advertised.What really turned me off from this book was when I was doing the sample tests and there were a couple answers that were clearly wrong. For instance, the question for General Science was what Chromosomes does a female have. The answers in the back said \"XY\" while it should have been \"XX\". This was just one of a few I found.While the style remains the same as most dummies books, I cant recommend this to anyone based on the errors in the sample tests.

I got to see all of the Disney classics, but Sleeping Beauty was, far and away, Disney's finest hour. The colors screamed off of the screen, and were at their best when the fairies were \"warring\" over what color to make Aroura's birthday dress. The fairies themselves were incredibly fun to watch & listen to, but the real star of the film was the most evil of all Disney's bad guys: Maleficent. When she laughs, your blood crawls. And when she turns into a dragon, the graphics are amazing.I can only imagine what the restoration process will do to the colors in this movie, but if the restoration of \"Snow White\" is any indication, then the relaease on DVD of Sleeping Beauty will be the masterpiece of all animated films.I can NOT wait until September for the release of this film.

A bold statement, I know, but true nonetheless. It is 80 minutes of your life that you will never get back. The only reason I kept watching is because I told myself: \"Self, there is no way a movie could be this bad. I am sure that they will wrap it all up at the end.\" WRONG. The story tried to be some sort of moralistic tale about the dangers of being self involved, but in reality it is a warning of the dangers of hiring a bad director. Please do not watch. And if you do - for the love of all that is quality movie making - DO NOT PAY THE $22 that amazon is charging.Note: The first scene involves a man ripping open his back to pull out an organ. I found this scene ironic because later in the movie I was considering ripping out my own eyeballs.",

Each episode is well summarised. I have only watched the movie and one episode at this stage. The 1951 movie, Superman and the Mole Men, which is the precursor to the television series, is really good. The first episode introduces Superman from the Planet Krypton to Earth and takes us through his childhood to his job on the Daily Planet. The quality of the film and episodes is also outstanding - the digital remastering has been expert, to say the least. For all those Baby Boomers out there - I would be very surprised if you didn't absolutely love this set - to say nothing about the hunky Georges Reeves! Bring on Series 2.

I really liked the comedy stories, The Art of Romance, and How To Make A Man Cuddle were pure genius, I literally laughed out loud. Some of the sad stories are a bit schmaltzy, but decent. The one I didn't really care for was Bunjiro. NOt that it was a bad story, I just think that he needed to make this its own seperate book.

I was extremely excited when I found that it was available on CD - and don't regret spending $40 for it. But even though this is my favorite recording of Cyndi (the performances have a fabulous energy - and she rips my heart out on \"I'm Gonna Be Strong\"), there is a lot of tape hiss - which I can only assume was on the original master.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Fox delivers a powerful yet believeable performance in Casualties of War. He becomes a seasoned combat soldier while at the same time retaining his humanity.

        "Based on this review, would the user recommend this product?\n===\nReview: Written by one of America's hottest contemporary erotica writers the author takes us on a real life tour of her private world of sex slaves, swinging and BDSM. In contrast to most readers pre conceived notions where the `sadism' part of BDSM lifestyle is usually a description of a master beating the living daylights out of his slave, Maria Isabel Pita describes her relationship with her master as a pretty well wholesome practice of living out her fantasies ......Yes there are rules and considerations to a good relationship and the results can only be understated as very very satisfying. Being a master erotica writer the author manages to describe her life in a manner that takes the reader on a delicious and vicarious trip into a world that generally are only deep and hidden fantasies of most women ....This real life exploration of a sex slave/master relationship make these fantasies not only seem more plausible but also delicious .....\nAnswer:",

        "Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review?\n===\nTitle: A Fascinating Novel, Replete with Miracles\nReview: Alice Hoffman uses a splendid narrative style to reveal how extraordinary life is. Her talent has captured me from the beginning till the end. This novel starts with telling us the Owens women had been blamed for everything that had gone wrong in their Massachusetts town. Gillian and Sally were two of them, one was beautiful and lazy whereas another one was very responsible. Their aunts encouraged them to practise witchery but what Gillian and Sally only wanted was to escape. Though they were seperated, but finally they're back together. Practical Magic not only describes withcery, but also the \"magical\" relationship between the Owen sisters.The novel is charming, funny and written in great rhythm. Once you start reading Practical Magic, it's hard to put it down because of the great narrative flow. The novel is as enchanting as the movie. Practical Magic is one of her best novels and you can't miss it.\nAnswer:",

Yes, we have a long way to go to be in a state where books are outlawed and firemen start fires instead of stopping them. But still, we have a good head start. People come home from work and plop on the couch and watch TV. You have to be an intellectual to read books. It's just not the norm anymore. In this book, TV has taken over people's lives with wall to wall TV screens. The imagination is lost in the hours of meaningless violence and comedy that is blasted through cables to people's homes. Then, through an array of events, the main character, Montag, starts to wonder about things and think for himself. With society frowning upon thinking, he's in a world of trouble. Fahrenheit 451 is a book that makes the reader think \"What really is important in my life?\"\nIs the review positive or negative?",

I copied several slides made back in the 1960's from a 110 film camera. While the slide frames fit in the copier, the opening wasn't large enough to get the entire image top to bottom. If the detail I wanted was on the very top of the slide, I inserted it into the copier upside down and vise versa. However, slides produced from 35mm film fit perfectly. I used a Nikon 35-105 macro lens in macro mode on a Nikon D3. Had to manually focus, but it worked fine. I only used that lens because it was the only lens with 52mm filter size. Bottom line, for the money this did the job. It was much quicker than a slide scanner.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product?\nReview title: it just gets worse\nProduct review: After reading Isabel Allende's brilliant The House of the Spirits back in the 80s, I looked immediately for other books by her. Of Love and Shadows was pretty good, but then things started going downhill when Eva Luna came into the picture. And this, Daughter of Fortune (Hija de la Fortuna) has to be the low point. It is little more than one of those pink-jacketed historical romances you can buy at the drugstore. Just because the author throws in a ghost or two and some Chinese medicine doesn't make this book magical, spiritual, or deep. It doesn't even feel particularly historically accurate. It's more like the writer just picked a random time in history and did a minimal amount of research into the era. Shallow, poorly defined characters don't help, either. Altogether a disappointment.",

It explores the philosphical and moral dilemma we face in dealing with criminals. By making the main character Alex as loathsome and brutally amoral as possible, the film underscores the idea that the horrific \"treatments\" given to Alex and his like are deserved by no one, no matter how despicable.The chief danger in this is that the violence and brutality displayed by Alex and his droogs are so vivid that the underlying message may be drowned out.

I have read most of his work in recent times and have even given his books as gifts to friends, but this latest effort is not up to Vidal's usual high standard. The literary essays are fine and in several instances wonderful. However in the political essays there was a sameness about them collectively that seemed to render them shrill and unreadable. It is not the content that I object to, merely the repetition. There is only on essay on politics in this volume and Vidal has repackaged it several times, reheating and serving it up again and again.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

There is almost nothing at all known about Margaret Taylor, Jane Pierce, Abigail Fillmore, Eliza Johnson, Eliza Monroe. The papers of women like Ida McKinley and Bess Truman have been destroyed by their families. There are no biographies at all of most of the First Ladies. So how in the world can these women be fairly judged when contrasted with modern activist women like Lady Bird, Hillary and Betty Ford? I saw none of this addressed in the text at all. This is ahistorical and does much damage. Also, the role of women is different. And there are no specific duties of a First Lady like there are for a President - so they are all different. You cannot compare First Ladies. This book should not have been written. Just a bunch of candy.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

I also feared that the book would be an angst-filled and self-absorbed ramble...it starts out feeling that way. After 20 pages, I was hooked. With creativity, humor, and heart, Howie takes us through a woman's self-discovery and her meeting of herself. There were moments when I felt I had lost the storyline, but that was due to my concrete thinking rather than any fault of the author. She asks the reader to stretch reality, break out of the dictates of linear time and one-dimensional experience, and imagine an inner world as real and tangible as the one we usually think of as \"reality.\" I loved the cat, Vinny, who gently encourages the narrator on her journey of self-discovery. I loved that Vinny, himself, ended up learning about self-acceptance, truth, and happiness. I recommend this book highly!",

I did not see the problems that others have reported with the light not turning off or shoddy construction.Cons: The breeze it produces is fairly weak and diffuse. It is also fairly noisy (from a rattle, not from the wind). I bought a 5\" O2 brand fan which is smaller, quieter and more effective. The O2 has the disadvantage (to me) of taking two D-size batteries but I was able to get a few hours out of it using AA batteries with up-sizing adapters. I thought the built-in light on the Wenzel would be nice but it seems that I usually don't want the fan and light pointing in the same direction. It would make more sense to have a separate light.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

That might be due to the fact that the subject matter is still in the theoretical stage. But, still, much of the book is anecdotal and many of the analogies used to explain the main theories are repetitive and off-subject. Plus, the book (and the information inside) is pretty out of date. Kaku often refers to things that might happen by the year 2000. This book is more useful for light reading than for really learning about unification theories and multi-dimensional universe models.",

Its an odd piece that really grows on you. What Love &First Cool Hive brings us to the forefront of the depth of expresion this man is capable of. He took chances that no other artist of his time would take. With Everything is Wrong, he was finalizing the techno bible so-to-speak. We end with Into the Blue- a fantastic piece that leaves you hanging in his grooves. In 1995, Moby was awesome but most folks did not see it. Then the off beat strang attempt with Animal Rights, which even now distance himself from. If you REALLY want to know Moby, this record is a must! Beautiful spin!\nAnswer:",

To me it is extremely funny though I prefer to use \"exciting\" and \"interesting\". Every joke isn't new but they've expressed themselves thoroughly. There's a key word: maintain one's composure.

        "Is this product review positive?\nTitle: It does humidify, but loudly and not a lot\nReview: This one works with water evaporation through a sponge inside, and a cheap, noisy fan at the top draws the somewhat moist air up and out. A much better choice is a humidifier that works ultrasonically, which is very quiet and puts out a lot more moisture. The vibrating membrane that creates the mist does get clogged over time with minerals if you have hard water. It can be cleaned to a point, but eventually it might stop misting. Small rooms may get too humid with the ultrasonic types. We have a Holmes HM495 that works very well.\nAnswer:",

This was distracting because I kept expecting her to rip off Mr. Knightley's head and eat it. There is no chemistry at all between Emma and Mr. Knightley in this film. This version was very close to the book, and many of the other actors are quite good, so it's a shame about Doran. Watch A&E's Emma instead, with Kate Beckinsale. This version is not be as true to the book, but Kate does a much better job of portraying Emma's complexities than does Doran or Gwyneth.\nIs this product review negative?",

But I also recognize that there are many scientific principles that govern the behavior of water. That science does not detract from the beauty and mystery of water for me. I do not need to throw science out the window to appreciate that beauty but apparently many others do. I once watched a 2 hour slide show and talk by Mr. Emoto, hoping to ask questions. He refused to take any questions afterwards, even though I had plenty. Where are the side by side comparisons of the ice structure of the same water that did not have the word or picture influences? Until similar photos are created with a control group and with the involvement of neutral 3rd party scientists, I can not believe any of the claims.

I think one of the best parts is when Mel is going to try and save the day. Thisgs blow up and his face, and HH is the one that saves him. I think it makes women realize that men like to be saved as well. I think it's a good learning film for both men and women. I though Mel did an excellent job.

If you are looking for an abridged version of this classic tale, look no further. The storyline is well captured and with many delightful descriptions still kept in. Often, however, the story seems to move quite fast and it makes you wonder what details are being left out. The level of English is about equal to the High School senior or early college level. A number of French word's are left untranslated which help add to the flavor of this classic French tale. The price is very low and its a great deal.I would definitely recommend this novel to students studying the French Revolution and Romanticism. There is a lot of historical and stylistic content that make this novel a gem for scholastic study. Also, if you would like a portrait of the comings and goings of aristocratic Europe around 1835, this novel depicts a lot from those societies.[...]\nAnswer:",

The water flow out of the coffee maker is so slow that you cannot even make a full cup of coffee and descaling does not help. I might be able to justify one of our coffee makers having a problem, but all three? When purchasing a coffee maker for $160.00, I certainly expect it to last longer than a year.

It is a very entertaining and realistic F1 simulation. It's not an arcade game like need for speed. You will need at least 450mhz, a good 3d accelerator and a steering wheel and it runs great. The only problem with the game is the AI. Racing other cars can be tough - but if you make it through the start (not often) and avoid braking early it is pretty real. Just running hotlaps by yourself is easily worth the price of this game. The tracks were done great! Don't believe the nay sayers. If you like F1 and race simulations, you will like F1 2000.",

I don't believe they're going to get people to re-buy the earlier books in the new design. And the new design is not a correction to the original design.

Jack Black is atrocious- moving your eyebrows a lot is not good acting, in case he didn't know.The sort of pederastic relationship between Jimmy and his big friend was weird and absurd.The writing... an insult to anyone's intelligence.If special effects could make a movie, I would give it five stars, but it can't, so I won't.

Forester\nProduct review: If you like nautical fiction of the great age of sail (e.g. Forester, O'Brian, Woodman, Marryat), you will enjoy this opening volume of the action-packed, fast moving and realistic adventures of our tarnished hero, Alan Lewrie. While on water, this book is as good as any of the above writers, excepting of course the incomparable O'Brian. However, our author founders on land with trashy sex scenes more appropriate to a Harld Robbins potboiler. The author trying to model his protagonist on Fraser's Flashman, or Fielding's Tom Jones comes badly ascupper. These humorless sex scenes are perhaps why this nautical series is not as popular as many others. However, once back on the high seas, this book recaptures its pace and becomes highly exciting and enjoyable. One day, however, I hope to open a book with a handsome, brave, cunning and feisty hero in possession of a small penis. It will, however, not be written by the otherwise entertaining Mr. Lambdin.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

There are so many different audio colors and tracks going on within each song that you can't possibly get everything on just 1, 2 or even 3 listens. The DVD version is a must as you get to see highlights of the album being made track by track. The songs are all fantastic and a bit more \"mature\" than their previous efforts. Some are really quite \"haunting\" in atmosphere - really unexpected at times, and very, very cool. The previous QOTSA CD's are all great albums, but this one is by far the most cohesive and well executed. Nick O. really is not missed at all except for his spastic vocals - I was surprised at this as he's been such a partner to Josh for so long. All in all a fantastic cd that is a must for your collection.\nIs this product review negative?",

It doesn't look like a brand new, HD film, but it does look better than many other attempted blu ray upgrades. And, the quality was consistent throughout: I didn't notice any sudden grainy-ness in some shots like with the recent Indiana jones blu, etc. if you love the film, or don't yet own it on DVD, then I recommend this blu ray. If you already have this on standard DVD, then there's really not much here to justify the minor upgrade to blu.\nIs this product review negative?",

The Firm, The Client, The Street Lawyer, The King of Torts all have that fast paced excitement we expect from a Grisham legal thriller. Such is not the case with The Last Juror. Although there are some interesting parts, this book reads much more slowly and lacks the excitement of most Grisham novels.The Last Juror is much more about life in a small southern town than it is a suspense novel. If you liked The Painted House then you will probably like this book too (I didn't like The Painted House at all). Just don't expect it to be a legal thriller.",

The album will never tell. \"Miss Inpdendent,\" although a catchy song, is just Miss Christina Aguiler's leftovers and doesn't deserve the publicity it's getting.RCA is just trying to turn Clarkson into a generic pop machine, make her into a Britney Spears although this will never happen. There is nothing traditionally sexy about Clarkson and I can't see her making a mark like Spears did. First album was successful, so? She won a contest, got lots of publicity, hence the reason she sold quite a few albums. She'll die off so fast in a couple months people will be saying, \"Kelly who?\"Buy Clay's cd instead.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

His music is brilliant, and he is one of the few, very few, musicians I would buy, on sight without the benefit of hearing the music.The above said, this CD is great, but a little tame compared to the Al Jarreau I grew-up with. I like the CD because it's Al's voice, but if this CD had been my first exposure to Jarreau, I am not sure if the 25 year love-affair I've had with his music would have been. If you really want to hear Al Jarreau listen to Live In Europe... I wore the grooves out of that album in high school. ....singing the song shobedo, while birds and rich folks flew-right-on-by... we got by....

The reason he is fired, is because he finds out that the company has placed some illegal substances in their products.Lowell Bergman, a representative from 60 minutes catches wind of this and wants Jeffrey to give an interview on 60 minutes, describing what wrong Brown & Williamson company have done.Without giving out any more spoilers, I can't say much more about the plot.What makes this film truly an epic film is the wonderful acting by Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Pacino gives what is truly an Oscar worthy performance.I highly recommend \"The Insider\" as it is not a simple film by any means, it requires you to think.\nIs this product review negative?",

First, the young reader (or audience) may not initially realize that main characters \"Jane\" and \"Teddy\" are the dolls of the titular \"Lily\" and \"Willy.\" Second, after several gentle scenes where Willy's Teddy copies whatever Lily does with \"Jane\" (\"Jane wants to climb a tree. Teddy too.\"), Teddy surprises us by not copying the nap that Lily gives Jane: (\"Jane wants to take a nap. Bear NO!\")It's a nice indirect take on the difficulties of naptime and the individuality of toddlers. The soft colors and simply told story will be popular with very young toddlers, With only 12 thick pages and 22 different words, this board book may also appeal to the very early reader.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

For example, if you see \"Constantine\" with the expectation of Oscar-worthy performances, you are almost certainly going to be disappointed.\"Constantine\" is an entertaining and action-packed ride, and Keanu is a fitting lead actor for the part. The main source of John Constantine's angst stems from a portion of Catholic doctrine that says that suicide is a mortal sin; thus, he is doomed to hell. However, after committing suicide, he was allowed to come back and try to \"atone\" for his mortal sin in any way that he could. This backdrop should allow anyone watching \"Constantine\" to appreciate the depth of the plot while overlooking occasional bad acting. The special effects are great as well as believable, and the ending ties everything up nicely with a bow while at the same time leaving room for a sequel.The fifth star is for the fact that this movie is NOT a remake.\nAnswer:",

I was about 8 years old then and I remember rooting for them to beat the Dodgers and collected many of their baseball cards.This book fills in all of the gaps in my memory and gives a nice summary of the team and how they fit into the world of baseball and the world as a whole. I hadn't realized there was such a strong Cuban connection on this team put together on the heels of Castro's takeover. Also interesting to learn about how the owners of those days (The Griffiths) often struggled financially to make ends meet. If you are a fan of 1960's baseball, you'll enjoy this book.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

Purchasing this book over the internet without looking through the book first at a local bookstore was a mistake. The System had a few good points, but on the whole it basically restates common facts like making eye contact, playing hard to get, and some basic psychology of women. When I first got the book I was surprised that it was so small; easily readable the first time through. Mispellings and typos also caught me offguard for a published book with such a distinguished ranking on Amazon. I wish there were more precise intructions/outlines for do's rather than dont's(ie. miroring a woman's bodylanguge). My advice to you is to skim through the book before you purchase it to see if its of value to you. I am considering purchasing The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene as a necessary follow-up.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

Having used older 'passed down' box fans in the past, I've never actually purchased one before. The ones I've had in the past were quite old, rusted, and flimsy - I've been in the need of an upgrade. So far, I've been very pleased with this model. I immediately noticed the improved quality of the frame and fan efficiency. Come fall, I usually place these on the interior window sill to bring in cooler air - thus saving money on air conditioning. My only complaint would be that sometimes it falls over - this is easily resolved by carefully positioning the fan and/or moving to a different surface (e.g. it tends to fall over more easily on carpet than wood). Said and done, this guy is powerful and worth the money; so far I'm happy with my purchase.",

It can be the users fault for hardware crashes (ie programs and Drivers). Only reason I did not give 5 stars was due to the fact that the Deskstar lineup have a weak hard drive casing.

Len Chess isn't the only paternalistic thing about this film. A mishmash timeline of race cliches and lazy storytelling, Cadillac Records can't even be bothered to get it's facts straight. Saving it from one star are the performances of Columbus Short, Mos Def and Eamonn Walker, all of whom are far better than the material deserves. The film provides about as much context as a 1950's Looney Tunes featuring celebrities of the day. Even if one allows for the need to condense a large story into a short time frame, have some continuity of character inside the abbreviated version.

He would have scoffed at allegations that his first book was a brilliant, evocative, militant, sentimental, enormously literate, invitation to help preserve what was left, (even though it is). Lake Foul, behind Glen Canyon Damn, broke his heart, but he remained a vibrant influence for free thinking until his death. This book, though it was his first, is still his best memorial.

Also, the table of contents is nearly worthless; no detail what-so-ever about the chapters, not even titles of the chapters, just Chapter 1 etc. and a page number. Even though you may think a newer publication is better, this one is much much worse and more expensive. Go with the 1980 publication.

Later works found them cranking up the Marshalls and getting a bit more shouty.Destination Universe is a rarity in this evolution: plenty of rawk but plenty of hooks, harmony-laced choruses and memorable lyrics. It's less quirky than International Pop Overthrow and less bombastic than Freak City Soundtrack. Jim Ellison seems to be relatively free of the demons that would later lead him to take his own life.It's a shame that this is currently out of print, but if you can find a copy it's the best place to start with MI and one of the best power pop albums you'll hear from any band.\nAnswer:",

Who says this is the greatest movie and Kurosawa is the greatest movie maker? Picking up one would be very difficult but probably I will pick Godfather instead. I know there are many Kurosawa admirers but I always found his directing is kind of 'clumsy', weird pace-not smooth, over the top acting (here, esp. Mifune...a clown).

Treehouse Of Horror was stylish and also very surreal, especially the first part. Bart Vs Thanksgiving, and Bart gets an F to an extent, falls into the pigeonhole of early episodes characterised by Bart doing somethig 'bad' (and personally I prefer seeing Homer be stupid) and neither are all that engaging, otehr than the superbly constructed Snow Day scenes.

I wanted to get a solid, firm understanding about global warming and climate - a scientific and historical perspective to be able to sort out all the noise. Interestingly enough, I heard Tim Flannery on the radio and it was his book that steered me to the purchase of these two. I stopped reading The Weather Makers about halfway through. I got so tired after reading about the one thousanth, four hundreth and thirty second CO2 readings over the past that I just stopped reading it. While the empirical data was presented, the discussion on climate and how civilization was and is affected over the milleniums was weak at best and often missing. If you want a book that has it all, may I reccomend Eugene Linden's \"The Winds Of Change.\"",

Normally, we agree on the movies we watch and the ones she forces down my throat are never as bad as I thought they were going to be. This movie changed all of these notions.It starts off like another \"Flashdance,\" which was a decent movie. But then it becomes a long music video, with dialogue thrown in to keep you from falling asleep.Well, it didn't work for me. Even the brilliant John Goodman could not save this movie.

Some would say it's time typical and some will say that it has little in common with the early Magnum. Well, that might be the case but the fact is that this album is very good - strong material, well performed and well produced. Magnum deliver quality rock with a lot of melody from the start to the end. You get rockers as well as ballads, and Magnum have not included a single filler on this solid album. Highly recommended!",

That's the effect of changing the script. After watching the original Night Of The Living Dead watching remake is pointless: Savini is not as good director as Romero, and the tension is unfortunately not the same... What's good in this movie? Patricia Tallman as Barbra is truly charming, and make up of zombies is just excellent. But the script is, as i said, much worse than original and all movie is much less scary. There are pure american black&white characters, when in original characters were much more complicated (especially Ben and Barbra). So, if you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you to see NOTLD'1968 -Romero's original. I saw sequel before seeing original: it seemed really good to me, but when I saw Romero's version...I was shocked. Two different movies, two different classes. Anyway, it's worth to see Patricia Tallman using crowbar to fight...:)",

The loup garou and Bray story lines promised greatness;rivals to Kay's throne from two different angles. I was looking forward to how Kay was going to solve the crime and deal with the professional challenge. Unfortunately, Cornwell revealed a startling lack of depth, and opted for the easy outs. She fell back to her old obsessions with Lucy and Marino; each becoming an increasingly disagreeable caricature of her/himself. And where did this sudden passion for Benton come from? That relationship always lacked warmth and compassion, nevermind passion. His death was just another convenient ending for her last Scarpetta book. This might be a good time for Cornwell to consider collaborating with another author who is a strong closer. She's petering out at third base and is unable to bring it home.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

The upper portion of the unit is identical, but the undersink heater unit appears to be made of plastic, not metal, like the previous model (which had a copper tank enclosed in styrofoam enclosed in sheet metal). Notably, the other unit ran silent but this model--which you think would be an improvement--makes a very noticeable \"roaring\" sound when heating the water, audible over a low TV or conversation even from under the sink. Also, the water out of the tap is about 30 degrees cooler (170 vs. 200) at the \"factory preset\" thermostat setting. Product description on Amazon is confusing and contradictory: is it a 1 yr or 3 yr warranty? 120 or 115 volts? 2/3 gallon or 1/2 gallon tank? It gets the job done, but it's the little things like this that give the impression of diminishing quality from the InSinkErator brand, and at this price point you expect more.\nAnswer:",

It is powered by only two AA batteries, which last only one photo taking and sometimes less. In Gateway's defence, they do provide two rechargable batteries with the camera, but that doesn't make up for having to change the batteries daily.I have had the camera only a week and have already had trouble with it accepting the memory card. At times, it said that there were no images. . . I jiggled the memory card around a bit and my hundred+ images reappeared. Very annoying!As for quality. . . No, this is no 4.0 megapixel camera. My older 3.0 camera takes better quality photos than this one. They tend to be grainy and fuzzy, regardless of settings, and close-up shots simply are NOT possible--despite the macro settings.It does have some nice \"bells and whistles\" with lighting and color options, but that simply doesn't make up for poor quality photos. If you are taking photos for more than family snapshots, this is NOT the camera for you.\nAnswer:",

        "Is this product review positive?\nTitle: See Them At the Outset of Their Careers!\nReview: Although the scratchy unrestored color makes this DVD it look as if it had been pirated in a movie theatre thirty years ago, it is well worth buying if only to see the delightful performances of young Helen Mirren as Hermia, Diana Rigg (taking a break from Emma Peel) as Helena, Judy Dench as Titania, Ian Richardson (who gives a preview of his \"House of Cards\" sardonic smile) as Oberon, and even the husband of Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced Bouquet) as Snug the Joiner. The production (with its pink-lipped green fairies and hairy-chested Puck) may have been misguided, but the actors shine as future stars of British stage and cinema.Because of the poor quality and the faded print, I'd actually give it three and 1/2 stars. I still recommend it, however, as a piece of historical interest.\nAnswer:",

I envy their ability to laugh at jokes that wouldn't pass muster at Mad Magazine. The direction, by a theater director who seems to understand nothing about film, is flat and awkward. It's as if everyone, including the wonderful (and wasted) cast, conspired to snuff what little comedic potential there may have been in the script. As a supposed satire of mystery novels, the film is obliged to be more clever than the average novel it parodies, yet there is nothing remotely clever about the plot (if it can be said to have a plot), and makes no sense whatsoever, on any level. It was painful enough to sit through a cable channel broadcast. It seems a crime to ask anyone to actually pay for the ordeal.",

However when it is forced down the throats of unwilling English students, Bronte's ultra-quixotic plot, and seemingly incessant need to detail the most superficial minutia only add to the painful legnth of the novel.By page 400, I had become so tired of Jane's apathetic nature, I was indifferent to the outcome, so long as it came swiftly.\nAnswer:",

        "Title: I agree with Virginia Woolf\nReview: Woolf was right. Joyce was obsessed with being, hm, obscure. I have read every book he wrote (not that many) and studied him at length. It has not helped. I cannot admire anyone who thinks we should have to work so hard to figure out what he was talking about. Normal people can't enjoy Joyce and I think this is a travesty. For all the hard work I had to do to figure out what he was talking about, I did not get one moment's enjoyment. Down with pretentious male modernists who feel we should all spend our lives \"working\" to unveil the \"true meaning\" in their words. For all you Joyceans out there who like to mock the \"commoners\" for not \"getting\" Joyce, I am working on a PhD in English--and I \"get\" him just fine, thank you. And I nonetheless refuse to give in to the pressure to like him. Brilliant as he may have been, he was full of himself. In my mind, these two qualities alone (brilliance and arrogance) should not get anyone's novels on the must-read lists.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

That being said, not all CD's are the same. \"Dr.\" Jeffrey Thompson flaunts his chiropractic degree in the title of his albums, but his background does not lend much skill to his abilities as either a neurologist or music composer. I have both \"Awakened Mind\" and \"Gamma Meditation.\" Basically, both of the CD's I purchased from this group are nothing but an endless and monotonous series of tones that cannot hold the attention long enough to acheive the desired affect. I did, however, listen to each album a minimum of five times to give them a fair trial... the effect was minimal compared to other CD's in my collection. Putting one to sleep is not the same as putting one in a meditative state! One extra star, however, for assisting me nicely in meditation while under the influence of alcohol...good listening for drunks?\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

You can pretty much predict the following scenes way before they happen,as well as the ending,due to following old formulas that have worked well in the past for less demanding audiences. Action being of paramount importance,this production delivers,meeting all expectations. Special effects,while not top notch,are only marginally below what might be expected for a high budget si-fi. Emotional behaviors of men trained exclusively for war are well conveyed throughout,but may miss the mark for those not exposed to the rigors of diversity. The DVD version has both widescreen and standard formats,something that should be included on all discs. Well worth the price of admission.\nAnswer:",

The voice acting is the best I've ever heard and the story line was great. April Ryan has to be one of the best game characters ever made. It's not because she is special, it's because she is so perfectly ordinary. The graphics are old and hard on the eyes but 7 years will do that. This game has very little action in it so stay away if that's what you want. I did enjoy Dreamfall a bit more but that's mostly because it was newer. Make sure you get the game patch from the official website and don't forget to check the voice outtakes after you finish the game. They are really funny. I hope a 3rd one comes out soon.

I'm so glad that I checked the NO box on the sex education form at my daughter's school and she was spared this movie. Maybe kids do go through this in a day, but I sure hope not. I would hope they wouldn't go through half that much in a lifetime. I'm realistic, I know that it's hard out there for teens-peer pressure, violence, rape and drugs and homosexuality abound. But this movie gave no hope or understanding, or strong underlining moral to grab hold of. The attempt at realism was overdone. The movie was a major downer with no punch at the end...so they all had sex and died, the end. Sheesh, I've seen better points made for not having sex with a condom. If they wanted to prove a point they should have shown the kid dying from the disease...instead of how they got it. We all know how they got it.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

He has a great talent for mixing and putting together CD's, and each new album is like another chapter to his ever-growing collection. In Search of Sunrise 4 is no exception, and it is a true work of art that is not to be overlooked by Tisto fans or any trance fans. From beginning to end on each disc, it's like listening to his past albums, and yet it has a sound all its own. That's Tito's talent, and that's why he's the #1 DJ in the world. My only problem with this album is the remake of his song \"UR\" featuring Matt Hales from Aqualung. If you listen to Tisto's 'Just Be' album, the original mix of \"UR\" is much better in my opinion. On this album, it's much faster-paced and it doesn't have the same melancholy sound as the original. Aside from that, this album is pure gold, and it's a must-have for anybody even remotely interested in Tisto.\nAnswer:",

The relationship between all the characters was so unrealistic that I almost regurgitated.

Also, I bought the crome one for the blue circle and it was not blue, but grey. The dial to change pressure is cheap.

I too stumbled upon this CD at a store and decided to take a chance and bought it. I was very surprised at how good this CD is. Robert really searched deep inside and pulled out some of his best vocal work in years. While other reviewers felt this album was soulless I say it was the quite the opposite. On such songs as 'Stone Cold', Wise guy, I Choose You, and the title track screams of sensuality that is especially true of Marvin Gaye's 'Let's get it on'.

I know what you are thinking, \"But he has done albums like this before! What about Harvest, Harvest Moon and Silver and Gold?!?!\". Sorry, but Prairie Wind is a pale imitation of those albums.The songwriting is weak and the arrangements are often saccharine and overbearing. I can honestly say that I enjoy \"Landing on Water\", \"Arc\" and \"Are You Passionate?\" much more than this album. At least LOW had \"Hippie Dream\", Arc took guts and AYP? had a great guitar tone. Prairie Wind just mocks all the good work Neil did wiith an acoustic guitar.If you are a collector it is a must but if you like good Neil Young music pass on this one and get the other acoustic albums.\nIs this product review negative?",

On the plus side, Kohler includes pictures of a great many extant garments, which are invaluable as a resource (the book's value as a source rises considerably after 1500 for this reason). On the other hand, there are many \"patterns\"--especially in the medieval period--which, unless you read carefully, can be interpreted as being taken from extant garments, and the introduction claims almost outright that these diagrams are \"correct.\" They are not, being instead Kohler's own hypotheses. Many of them do not work as patterns. I have known many a beginner who took these diagrams as gospel and have ended up with nothing resembling an actual medieval garment. Use the illustrations (but not the \"patterns\") and the book can have some degree of usefulness.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

I had such high expectations for this album, but I bought it the first day it came out...and I am so dissapointed. I just can't believe that this is the same band that has just made the 5 best rock albums of the decade (Ten, Vs., Vitalogy, No Code, Yield)...it shocks me how fast a band really can go down hill. Their is not even one notable good song on this album...it's all easily forgettable. Their last two albums (No Code, Yield) were Pearl Jam's best yet, and then they make this. I was so sure that they were just going to keep getting better like they always have...but I was wrong. Pearl Jam has always been my favorite band, and they still are, but this just proves that their best days are behind them...although their best days were not so long ago...\nAnswer:",

The Blu-ray \"Rockin' Rydell Edition,\" however, requires some comment.The overall picture is very good: colors are sharp, not overly saturated, good detail. No complaints -- the video transfer is pleasing.The AUDIO, on the other hand, is awful. The soundtrack musical numbers are clear and actually improved upon in 5.1 surround. But the dialog track is astonishingly muddy. There is a noticeable difference between the audio quality of the dialog and that of the musical numbers. I thought it was just my imagination until, after viewing, my wife made a comment about how hard it was to hear the dialog. This was a major disappointment, and for that reason, I would not recommend the Blu-ray edition.Haven't watched all of the extras yet, but they are as expected, fun but nothing you probably didn't already know if you are a fan of the film.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Her acting abilities are questionable, why? Because I (and many people) have never heard of her. The whole movie is just really badly done. It's too violent for children yet too foolish at times for adults. Especialy a little scene at the begining when Joan is a little girl and she just had that vision with the sword and she comes back home just to see her mother (am not sure if it was her mother or not) killed with that same sword and then raped. The scene is disgusting in that even though it is a bloody and violent scene and the viewer is raging with disgust for the rapist the director decided to make it a \"fun\" scene by portraing the rapist as a fool and clown.

While his imitations of Sammy Davis Jr., Nat King Cole, and Rod Stewart were very good, they were only 3 in a litany of more than 25 voices he attempted to do - most sounded the same, and nothing like the original. Why am I griping? $100 to see this would have been much better spent on 5 rides on the Stratosphere coaster.

Instead I got a well filmed low budget chick flick version of a zombie movie that took itself way too seriously. This movie had huge potential considering the story line. It seemed more like a lecture about the bad people who are wrong to hate others. Even going so far as to have the people speaking out against the zombies quote the Hitler. Most of the things they tried to make humorous failed to be funny. I would suggest saving your money if you are looking for a fun b movie.

Fatal debs seem to assault him from every angle, and Marlowe is beaten, drugged and abused mercilessly, but somehow he never gives up and keeps doggedly pursuing the truth about corruption and death in Los Angeles.Chandler's use of language is brilliant as always, and the plot is somewhat difficult to follow, but really, with Chander at work, who needs plot?

However, part of my motivation in reading this book was to get a greater sense of the 'home front' aspects of war and since I like Mr. Brokaw's tabloid style of journalism I felt I was on to a winner. Although eminently readable as expected, there was, after Chapter 3 or so, a sameness to each bite-sized vignette that eventually lead me to discard the book in annoyance. I never finished the wretched thing ! In short, repetition is Mr. Brokaw's greatest sin and while he established firmly the decency, ordinariness and patriotism of the Greatest Generation, he did them no great service by effectively imbuing them with an undeserved tag of 'Boring' as well !\nAnswer:",

Instead, all i saw was an over-complexified paranoia fest, with pidly little robots scenes with, and then it went right back to will smith! The only really redeemable thing about this movie that stopped me from giving it 1 stars was the fact that the visuals were so darn cool!

Although her books span a period of decades, they all read as though they were written today. There's a few odd details in some of them, but mostly they rely on good storytelling and... well, very real-seeming children.This is the story of Ramona's kindergarten year. It can be hard to find chapter books that are worth reading to kindergarteners, but this is it - Ramona actually seems like an actual child who is actually, really, truly in kindergarten! When she's told to \"sit here for the present\" she does, waiting for her present. When she struggles to refrain from pulling perfect Susan's curly \"boingy\" hair, you can feel how hard it is. And it's easy for all small children to understand why Susan's trying to act like a grown-up is annoying for Ramona.I would really suggest this as a first read-aloud chapter book for a young kid.",

I love the scene with Bilbo and Gollum and I think this Gollum with his appearance and voice charaterization is the definitive Gollum. I wish Rankin Bass would have done all 4 books instead of just 1 and 4. Sure they are simplified, but they are far better than the aborted version of Lord of the Rings done by Bakshi.\nAnswer:",

        "Title: Carly Simon: 5-Stars : Sound: NO-Stars\nProduct review: This is one of the great albums of any decade! The SHM-CD sound is a disaster, as it clearly demonstrates, by its extra clarity (can anyone say \"boosted-treble, boosted-bass three times fast), that there has been no remastering of the material save the boosted parts of the sound spectrum. The classical releases in this format--try Karajan-Mahler on DGG for a truly memorable earache--are disgraceful. After many tries at finding one \"really better than the original\" SHM-CD, I've given up on what I perceive to be a marketing ploy to pawn off older recordings at a \"boosted\" price.Even though the original release of \"No Secrets\" didn't have the greatest overall sound, it was more-than acceptable do to Ms. Simon (who in the photo leaves \"no secret\" to the fact that she isn't wearing undergarments--excellent!) and her immense talents.Buy the regular CD and skip this expensive turkey. Better yet, if you do vinyl, try to find a good copy.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

The strongest tracks here (\"A Most Unpleasant Man\", \"Shine It All On\", \"The Only Thing I Care About\", \"She Loves a Puppet\") are better than anything on the first CD. However, a few tracks simply don't cut it with me. \"LA River\" wastes a fairly good music track with rather lame \"I'm nobody\" lyrics, while \"Tomorrow I'll Be Nine\" is the \"I'm nobody\" motif yet again, and I can't say I feel for the tyke.

        "Title: Allenko Brotherhood Ensemble - Brotherhood\nProduct review: Afrobeat originator Tony Allen, under the name The Allenko Brotherhood Ensemble, gets his famous drumming patterns put through the ringer by various electronic artists. The back cover promises Afro-centric electro grooves - and it's quite accurate. The tracks don't stray far from their African roots, which results in some fascinating combinations. The Son of Scientist, for instance, invite Eska to provide vocals to the dubbed out \"The Drum,\" while the Cinematic Orchestra makes \"Brotherhood\" a piano- and rhythm-driven track, which gets progressively frenzied. Several artists here -- Boozoo Bajou and Jeff Sharel, for instance -- are known for their adaptation of African music so it comes as no surprise that they contribute tracks. But there are a few surprises: the Troublemakers doing a dark and jazzy soundscape, or Kirk Degiorgio's Off-World Ensemble doing tech-funk. A fitting tribute to one of the rhythmical masters.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

However, it is very much a repeat of everything that happened in the preceding four books in the series about the cro-Magnon woman--Ayla continually dazzles Jondalar's family with her ability to start fires with flint, domesticate wild animals, hunt better than the men in the tribe, etc. in the hopes that her amazing abilities will help them accept her as one of them. With nothing new to add to the series, this one was not worth the time it took to finish reading.\nAnswer:",

I expected similar quality, but was totally disappointed. The blade assembly does not fit snugly in the cup, so it slips around and doesn't chop well. The base cracked within the first few times I used the unit (with no abuse whatsoever). Shortly thereafter the lid cracked too. At one year old, it is completely worthless and I am replacing it (with a cuisinart).\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

I have to admit because I read so much I cannot remember the main character's name but her lack of naivete' and trust is what alot of women do today. I was with her all the way with trying to give her marriage all that she could but I was also with her when she said enough was enough. Now the only thing I didnt like about the book was her reasoning to stray when her married life wasnt taken care of--when she hadnt made any concrete moves to end it.What this book also echoed is that spirtuality is in the heart not a church/building/man/tithe. I dont even think it is worth mentioning the souless display of her husband Curtis!Without a doubt I recommend this book and it is now being circulated throughout my friends list to finally be read again by me!",

However, I was severely disappointed when I started reading the book. Sure, the cover's attractive, and sure, the author was a teenager when he wrote it -- the book seems to have become a bestseller on those two factors alone, because it definitely wasn't literary merit that's caused it to sell so well.I anticipated Murtagh's little secret from the moment he was introduced, I found the main character to be bland and boring, and the story was hackneyed and ripped from other writers. I recommend fantasy fans read works by far more talented authors such as Holly Lisle, JK Rowling, and Eoin Colfer.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

The drive also works with the old usb 1.1, but will only run at a speed of 6x instead of 24x.So you will have to buy a usb 2.0 port card in addition to this drive.

The man who doesn't let little things like world events, force capability, or the experience level of his senior commanders get in the way of his version of reality? Ok, I decided to keep an open mind. After all, as a military officer, he is my in my chain of command. But after reading this, I have to agree with the reviewer from the UK - rubbish. The only lessons you will learn here are those that show you what not to do. Rumsfeld has single handedly alienated most of the senior officer corps, not to mention most of the military too. The anger within the military towards Rumsfeld is growing. I wouldn't be surprised if, push come to shove, at some point the military refuses to do this man's bidding. If it keeps up much longer, a coup seems certain. This book, if followed, will lead to the same situation in your company - divisiveness, anger, and ultimately implosion.

Both could play MP3s, SVCDs, VCDs and DVDs, but in my experienc RCA players don't function as the description or even the manual describe. In fact that ties in to my only complaint, the manual. It contains a good description of playing DVDs, nothing else. No help in formatting MP3 files on CD-Rs or any other reference material. Just DVDs.

Throughout the 60s, Elvis was being humiliated making bad movies like TICKLE ME and HARUM SCARUM while The Beatles and Bob Dylan were changing the music scene.In SPEEDWAY, Elvis plays a singing race car driver (for the third time!) who gets into trouble with the IRS. He falls in love with Nancy Sinatra, and that's about it for the plot.The only saving grace is that the cast is better than average. It's quite interesting to see Elvis act alongside \"Lucy\" regular Gale Gordon. The songs are a little better than average, especially the quite good \"Let Yourself Go\".Again, it's not that bad. It's a definite improvement over CLAMBAKE, but a far cry from JAILHOUSE ROCK or KING CREOLE.",

In Blood Omen 2 the abilities are for Kain while in Soul Reaver2 it is for the Reaver. Blood Omen and Soul Reaver's graphics are pretty much the same, but in Blood Omen there is sometimes problems where it will slow down or freeze which has never happened before with my Soul Reaver game. Despite some problems Blood Omen is still a great game but you should definatly rent this game before purchasing it you might just be able to beat it because it's kind of short but then again so is Soul Reaver. So you should definatly rent both these title's first. Happy hunting.",

Other's have pointed out that it does not follow form to the book, however, as one who has never read one of the books, the film alone is very entertaining. Something had to be left out or this film would have probably passed the four hour mark.As usual, great visual effects. I loved the entry of the two rival schools. Sorry, I now know that they aren't private schools for boys or girls, but it was very entertaining the way it was presented...and isn't that the final point?It was also interesting how the characters have grown up and are recognizing their hormones.

Tolkien was one of the greatest creative minds of all time, but he didn't do a good job with the action, nor with Legolas and Gimli.

A painstaking frame-by-frame restoration was conducted, and the soundtrack remastered, resulting in a film which probably looks better now on DVD than when it was originally released. This film has always been a favorite of mine of all the Disney classics, and I think the music has a lot to do with it. \"Once Upon a Dream\" is truly beautiful, which is a given considering the classical composition it was based on. The artwork is superb, even for Disney in its heyday.

It was almost as great as the oringal Tim Burton film. And that's saying alot! Bale did a wonderful job as both Bruce Wayne and Batman...almost out doing Micheal Keaton. The acting was wonderful....every one really put everything they had into their given role. I loved the fact that we got to watch Jim Gordon as he rose through the ranks over the course of the movie. Micheal Cain had some funny lines and all the flashbacks with young Bruce and his father really tugs hard on your heart strings! I must admit though the secnes showing people's fears after being exposed to Scarecrow's fear gas were a bit scary and could give younger viewers nightmares. Another than that I high recomend this movie to every one! Batman fans or just movie lovers GO SEE THIS MOVIE AS SOON AS POSSIABLE!!\nAnswer:",

Designer Apple Pie is nice, the trick of boiling down the apple juices is slick. But the cream cheese crust? I've had better results from the Joy of Cooking recipes. Her recipes are too fragile to be reproduced consistently. If you are off by a degree in the oven, or off by a minute in the timing, forget it, your pie is ruined. Other pie recipes are less sensitive. Working with her crust recipes is like walking on eggshells.I've been making pies for 20 years. I can't say the details that make Berenbaum's recipes so complicated make her pies much better than ones I've made in the past from other cookbooks. Very disappointing.\nAnswer:",

Though I like Milla Jovovich, always. About French's madness, if you are interested in it's beauty and mystery (in this movie, it is expressed little and not so completely), I recommend \"Beatrice\" and \"the ninth gate\"(but I've ever seen few French movies). Notice how those people betray God; the ways are funny sometimes and beautiful sometimes, though are cruel (cruelty is based on despair) the same time, of course.

The conclusion that he reaches has implications for a whole understanding of the Old Testament and the its relation to the New Testament. The essential message is this... The law was not inherently \"bad\" or oppression to the people of Israel. The problem resided with the people themselves. Only a remnant were true followers of Yahweh. For this faithful remnant, who had the Spirit operating in their lives, the law was good (cf. Psalm 119, et al). But for those without the Spirit (the majority of Israel), the law was simply \"letter\", and a burden. They did not want to keep it, nor could they. Seeing this helps us to understand both \"good\" and \"bad\" statements about the law in the NT writings.Hats off to Hafemann!\nIs this product review negative?",

And the way that Paolini kept on dropping BIG hints that Eragon was going to have this romantic love affair. That has really put me off the next book. And I wonder who the lover is going to be?

        "Title: Dangerously flawed\nReview: Galbraith is an economist who could only operate in academia--in any other setting he would be a joke. In his many books, which are widely cited, he attempts to provide an economic justification to socialism. The principle flaw in this book, from which all the others radiate out, is that all spending is equal. That government spending is just as productive to the economy as personal or corporate spending. He uses this assumption to justify confiscation of wealth by the government through the tax code. Of course, we know now that most of the taxes collected by the government is at best wasted money, and at worst counterproductive to society (welfare, subsidies, foreign aid to countries that hate us, etc.)All that being said, I highly recommend reading this book. It's important to know the enemy.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

In her time, when her books were being published, Jane Austen's name was NOT on the book. Not until several years after it was published did Jane's name appear on Pride and Predjudice.Please authors, do a simple Google search before you put anything so easily checkable in print, for God sakes!

We have 10 - 15 people who use it intermittently. It does not see heavy use. From the beginning we've had trouble with it jamming and feeding multiple pages. The cover to open it is very hard to snap open, and it won't recover from a jam without us turning off the scanner and rebooting the computer. I discovered that if I change the automatic document feeder pad assembly every 3 months or so, which I should not have to do, it helps the jamming and misfeed issue. Recently I went to order these pads, which were $20.00 apiece, and I couldn't find them on Xerox's website. When I called them they said this item was no longer being sold individually, but in a kit with cleaning solution and 2 pads. So what would have cost $40.00 - bad enough - now costs $100.00 !! As if we haven't spent enough money and frustration on this thing. I am going to do my best to get rid of this thing and buy one that works!",

Somehow, utilizing mostly satire, this film captures the pain and longing beneath the trappings of wealth. A straightforward, empathetic approach wouldn't have worked -- these aren't the most charming people. By distancing us from their pain, Avary actually allows us to see it more clearly.The film collapses under its own weight at the end. Anyway it's less a real narrative than a freeform look at sexual confusion and mores at the end of a wretched century. Beautiful and brave performances from start to finish, especially Ian Somerholder's as a pampered, narcissistic gay student with a very wrong crush.\nIs this product review negative?",

My 21-month old (21 pounds) sleeps 12 hours a night and with these diapers in size 4 (up to 37 pounds) she wakes up with pee having soaked through the diaper onto her pajamas. She ever peed through the diaper on a 2 and a half hour flight. Not sure why they are called baby dry, but they sure don't keep her dry at all. I just placed another order for the cruisers, but now I'm stuck with 150 of these poor diapers too.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

It is filled with contemplations on the importance of simplicity and balance in one's life.A busy woman who has focused her life on success becomes enamored of Amish quilts. Her admiration is so great that she takes time out from her life to go and live with the Amish. There, she reflects on her own values and comes to realize that the act of doing is as important as the outcome. She also realizes that being a part of something, rather than standing out from others, is a more cooperative and giving way to live.How the author juxtaposes the meaning of things with the sentiment reflected in the quilts is very lovely and meaningful.I highly recommend this book for anyone who has ever had questions about what is important in life and their own core values.",

There's enough little accessories included to keep any little girl happy, and the \"dance floor\" is fun. You can also use the Kelly dolls on the twirling dance floor. The dining table also becomes a full-length mirror so a princess can admire her gowns. Ths only negatives we've found so far are that the canopy for the bed does fall sometimes, but not every time, and you can't put all the pieces inside the castle when it's folded. It is nice to have a castle that can fit on a shelf though, and the toy is well worth the price.",

For us mere mortals, this is a terrible textbook. Instead of laying out proofs as formulas, almost everything is in paragraph form. In addition, the author has a terrible habit of saying \"Given premise A, one can easily come to conclusion Z\" with no mention of steps B through Y. This is not for the problems marked difficult at the end of the chapter. This is the first thing that he will say at the introduction of a topic. Do yourself a favor and look at Springer's undergraduate math series books in partial differential equations. Also, you can google \"Paul's Math Notes\".

The book was fun, Bilbo was an extremely reluctant hero. His adventures just came upon him and he survived in spite of or because of his own bumbling but pure heart. As Bilbo and the dwarves and Gandalf neared their goal of destroying Smaug in his Lonely Mountain lair, there were unintended consequences of their acts to other groups including the community of men down the river. I liked it that things were not so black and white. Certainly this book is a much better read than the movie which I found to be overly somber and incredibly violent with very hard to believe fighting sequences where nobody gets hurt. Read it and compare. You'll see what I'm talking about.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Unfortunatly for Eragon, no one would buy the stone and his hopes of buying food for the winter evaporate. When a group of henchmen for a tyranncial ruler set out to take what Eragon knows nothing about, Eragon's world is shattered. Only with the help of a mysterious old man, a mythical beast and unknown powers can he dethrone a traitor and restore peace to Alageasia...This book is a MUST read for anyone who is even moderatly interested in fantasy.

And Jennifer is one of the most successful singers to achieve that challenging task. Her music is not an entertainment or show; even in her concerts, one can see and feel that she is sharing her own experience with God with her audience, and that she truly loves her Lord.Her voice is extraordinarily pleasant and expressive, mature at the same time full of life.

I really did. He was great in Black Star, great in his debut Black on Both Sides, and generally great on his guest appearances on other songs. However, this New Danger is a colossal failure.Half of the songs are not even songs at all. Most of the album is just Mos Def talking/ trying to sing over a good beat. The songs generally go nowhere.This album is 100% pure ego. It is Mos Def trying to make an epic album to span all of musickind.Hands down, this is one of the most annoying, disappointing, irritating albums I have ever heard - and I've heard a LOT of CD's in my time.Please don't believe any of these five star \"absolute classic\" reviews.",

The Proctor Silex 4-Slice Toaster is compact and attractive and on top of that, it toasts the bread very well. It doesn't have a lot of frills, but does toast bagels as well as bread, and that's what we were interested in. It is much more reasonably priced than almost any other brand. If it has any drawbacks, it's that it seems a little light in weight. Although we've had it for only a month, we are quite satisfied with it.\nAnswer:",

My periods have always been irregular, however I still did not expect them to just stop when I was 25.. I suffered the mental agony of never getting periods unless I took Provera when I decided enough was enough. The wise Internet came to my rescue and convinced me that Vitex could be the solution. I started taking this product once a day (first thing in the morning) for 120 days (2 boxes) with a gap of 2 days when I forgot to pack it on a business trip. During those 120 days, I got 5 periods (spotting, very light to light flow). Then I decided to give myself a week's break... and got my full fledged period. So, so thankful! If your doctor says everything's okay with you (yeah, right) BUT you just need Provera to get your period and fertility treatments to have children, I HIGHLY recommend you try this product. Just give it time to work. Good luck!",

Theirs is a relationship that surprisingly springs amid bleakness and desolation, flowers against all odds, and ultimately wilts under betrayal.Readers will discover that Orwell's objectives are both thoroughly and terrifyingly achieved with a perfectly dystopian ending.\nAnswer:",

I cringe at the memory and the heated discussion I had with the professor (a Joyce fanatic). Now as a librarian I decided to give it another attmept, trying to keep an open mind. I have to give Joyce points for being clever and kudos for verbosity. After struggling through it again, I had to ask myself what was the point? Most of the book strikes me as an attempt by the author to show how very clever he was with word play and analogy and practically every other literary devise under the sun.To me as a reader, literature requires something more than an exercise in erudition or diction.

You can decide for yourself which version you prefer. There are some terrific performances in the British film, and brilliant directorial flourishes.

BUT having said that, there's no denying that Mangione has a talent for melody invention. And he seems to surround himself with sidemen who are likewise \"melody-sensitive\". This time he's teamed up with producer/co-songwriter Morris \"Butch\" Stewart. Some tracks sound like vintage Mangione of the late 70s, while others - \"hip-hop Mangione?\" - make one wonder WHO thought THIS would be a good idea? All in all this is a recording worth having in the collection if you're of fan of CM back to the days when he was credible. It presents the Rise and Fall of an artist; even so, you still end up whistling some of those tunes!\nAnswer:",

Park your brain at the door and enjoy the snappy cliche dialogue which actually has a lot of humour, the superb (for a low-budget American production) martial arts editing, and most of all the looks on the actors faces, most of whom look like they can't believe they did this film for the money.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

It's always a pleasure to come across an author that is endowed with both gifts. Keeping Faith is a highly readable, thought provoking look at religious dogma, family secrets and modern relationships. What would you choose to believe if confronted with the unexplainable? Can true religious miracles exist in this age of doubt? Picoult does not try to steer us in any one direction, just poses the questions and provides the fodder for thought and discussion. For that she gets 4.5 stars. My only negative comment pertains to the point of view, which jumps between a third person and first person narrative. I often found it confusing and rather offputting and would have preferred a consistent type of narration.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

There are a lot of kissing scenes but its so cute. The best parts are when Anne find Gil after singing their wedding song and when Anne wakes from a bad dream and then tells Gil about it and then Gil promises her that he will find Dominic and then Gil wraps his arm around Anne. But where was the wedding? I mean we have been waiting for this moment for a long time. And instead we get a lousy 15 minutes. Hmmm. >:[ But all in all this is an awesome movie and you should buy it!

Maybe that's why people love the story. There is always one character (at least) that you can identify with. Just a warning, don't read it and expect to know all about the Civil War. It will talk about it, but it concentrats (spelling, sorry) more on Rhett and Scarlett than the war. Some say that it was racist. Slavery was wrong, there is no doubt about that, but there were always different kinds of masters. The masters in GWTW were obviously kind ones. This presents the way the South saw the war, which was very VERY hard on them. Read it and do yourself a favor. Just a suggestion, though, watch the movie first (which is also excellent) and then read the book so you won't be dissappointed with the differences.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

        "Based on this review, would the user recommend this product?\n===\nReview: I love Bruce Springsteen. My younger sister introduced me to his music when she was a teenager. I had first heard from others, that his music was boring, trite and over done. I was listening to Mott the Hoople, Quicksilver and Humble Pie and I had it all going on. My friends did not care for Springsteen and still most of them do not.I saw him in concert in 1984 in Worcester, Ma and I cried almost all night..It was soooooooooooo wonderful. My sister and I, were hoarse for 3 days afterwards. Every song, he played for us. Every move, he made on stage..was for us.I have not seen him perform recently, but would if the chance came about.I love this album, I love all his albums. I love him with and without his band and with and without Patti.He is a great artist and a great musician. I want to thank Mr. Springsteen for being there when I needed him and my sister for making the whole thing possible, in the first place.\nAnswer:",

But COME ON! I hated it. It's so DEEP that one is supposed to bow down and grovel at its' inner meaning and mensa level plot. Kidman was better in Days of Thunder and Eye Wide Shut (that statement was sarcasm for those who weren't sure).Oh well, I've never felt the impulse to write one of these reviews before but I just felt compelled to air my feelings. I absolutely love the movies. I am seduced by good plots and great characterizations. This was boring and tedious.

Gangs of bikers and kamikaze lunatics roam the long stretches of road that populate the stretch of land known as the Austrailian outback. Mel Gibson soars as the tough futuristic cop Mad Max in this extreme action thriller that started it all. Amazing non-computerized stunts make this movie a treat to watch over and over again. After his wife is brutally murdered by an evil group of bikers, Max sets out on a crazed revenge, earning his heading \"Mad\". Grinding action sequences and Gibson's cool headed attitude make Han Solo look like second hand trash. Just like what Star Wars did for sci-fi, this movie revolutionized action movies for all time, setting the standard of today.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

However, the book is driven by a string of highly improbable coincidences. A drunk just happens to remove the license plates from a car. The detective just happens to keep running into Lucienne on odd occasions and critical junctures. The detective just happens to be struck by a painting hanging on the victim's wall. Lucienne just happens to be in a location where some Italians just happen to be talking about the victim's wife, in a language Lucienne just happens to understand. The victim just happens to withhold from Lucienne his crucial conversation with his wife. Van der Valk didn't solve the mystery, the solution just happened to fall into his lap (with some loose ends that are never explained).

I think that is so funny, because it is so easy to believe that it's true! His writing is hysterical. It's so modernly comical, and to think that the story is meant to take place a century ago and have such behavior and commentary is so very humorous. You'll almost believe in Florin and Guilder and some things in the book that were not included in the AWESOME film are just as funny to imagine as if they had been in the film. I loved this book so much because it was such a change for me - usually I read the book, love it and wait for a film to come out, but this time I saw the film, never realized there was a book to go along with it, and then read the book and really enjoyed it.

Rack did fit nicely on the bumper of my car and didn't leave any scratches. If you own any sort of sedan though beware. This rack places the bike(s) above the height of the car, so not only is it difficult to lift up, but is a killer of gas mileage too. Despite being in the Saris fit guide, my Kia Rio had a drop of around 10mpg and I was travelling slow. I placed the rack on a large domestic sedan and it fit about the same, very high above the car. Apparently it is only meant for mountain bikes with wide tubes as I needed to place rags around the bike tubes on my 3 speed and hybrid in order to prevent slipping. Still the bikes did encounter a few scratches once I reached my destinations. I ended up returning the rack to Amnazon without hassle and bought the Thule Speedway which fits much lower on my car and the bikes fit on it properly.",

I won't divulge any key plot elements, but the solution to the mystery is such a stretch, it reminds me of when writers were commanded to have Alfred rise from the dead and be revealed as \"The Outsider\", way back in the early days of the \"new-look\" Batman. E.g., at one point, Hal Jordan, another DC character they keep re-trashing, who knows who the killer is since he's now the Spectre (whew!), tells Green Arrow to really punish said killer when they uncover him/her. Well, when you find out who the killer is, you'll realize that Hal would never have said that. Any rate, the motive for the murder is so convoluted, all I can say is, DC should let the pros (Frank Miller, Alan Moore, Keith Giffin) write these epics.

        "Based on this review, would the user recommend this product?\n===\nReview: I was excited to tackle this book, but my excitement faded quickly. The prose are not streamlined and there is no substantive thread to tie the quote-fronted chapters together. Of particular annoyance was the author's obsession with going through a qualitative and repetitive laundry-list of species that are rare and in trouble. Perhaps if this list were presented in conjunction with some historical perspective this could have worked, but as is, it really doesn't.I would recommend taking a look at Ruddiman's recent book on climate and humans if you want a real perspective on the role that the \"weather makers\" have had on the physical climate system, but I have no suggestion for a good and historically-grounded book on the biological effects of human-induced climate change.\nAnswer:",

Also said he going with another girl{which was true}, then she sabotaged the yearbook ballots! . That's when Mary Anne did her own scheming as well, along with the BSC's rival, Cary.In this book you could see Mary Anne try on new attitudes and maturing from the old quiet Mary Anne! She even snuck out of her house! Now that's major improvement! Also in this book Mary Anne and her parents settled long overdue conflicts.Mary Anne has proven herself to Logan, BSC, Cokie, the whole school,... and herself that she is here and here to stay!\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

We keep them in the side pocket of the car and pull them out for games on longer road trips. They are great to help pass the time when everyone has gotten bored from the usual activities in the car. Recently, we started using them in a car pool. The kids love them; the only drawback is, after a few trips via the same route, they know just where to find things. I have them call out when they see things so only one kid can claim credit for what they see. It adds a little more challenge that way. These would also be great to take along on field trips, scout trips or any trip covering new territory.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

This is perhaps one of his best solo albums in my mind and an excellent follow up to the first which may have had some tentative steps. Here Peter is certainly back on sure footing and seems to know where he is going with his music. For me the music is far more interesting and musically appealing than his newer stuff. Even when he plays some of his older numbers it seems he has lost perspective on it. That being said Flotsam and Jetsam is a highlight though almost any number is right up there with anything he did with Genesis. The live performance of the material really made these songs stand out. Personally I'm not exactly impressed with his World music, but if you want an idea of where Genesis could headed its all here.\nAnswer:",

Sure, Tony talks about his girlfriend a bit in there, but the song is still fun. The only thing that confuses me about that song is where the scratching comes from. This CD turned me into a fan for life. Once I heard this CD I told a bunch of friends about and urged them to buy a CD. Most of them did.

Physics professor Parker begins with basic descriptions of life on Earth. He then devotes three chapters to Mars, including the possible existence of microfossils in a chunk of Mars that hit the Earth as a meteorite. Parker moves on to extrasolar planets and the radio search for extraterrestrial intelligence. After touching on interstellar flight, he closes with a discussion of the claim that Earth has been visited by aliens. All this adds up to a broad brush overview, leaving out most of the detailed arguments associated with this question. The writing, which avoids equations and elaborate statistics, seems to be aimed at the high school level.

At times, I felt stupid reading it because I didn't understand it.

Why Giorgio bothered to squeal his way through \"Hello W.A.M.\", I don't know. It hurt the end of the film, itself, and adds nothing to this soundtrack. \"Love and Passion\" - lyrics by director Paul Shrader - totally sum up the feelings of any intelligent person who has tried to live too long in Los Angeles.This dates very well because L.A. is STILL the L.A. of this film (1980) - fun, dangerous, superficial, materialistic - so take it along on your next trip and drive along the lonesome freeways with Moroder's hypnotic electrobeat propelling you along.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

The problem is there's no compatible driver available, not on HP's LaserJet 1020 installation disk and not on the HP website. I emailed HP Tech Support about the problem and they suggested two workarounds, using x64 drivers for other HP printer models, but neither worked.

What I did not realize is that I was starting to recognize the right answers since the questions are used over again for the online banks of questions, so when I took the board exam my score was actually lower than what I was getting on the practice exams for the book.

Only use it to make one or two cups per day with highly filtered water from a Kinetico system. Two weeks ago I had the problem where the machine just hummed and no water or coffee came out. Called customer service (you have to call on off hours to get in reasonably quickly). They told me to do the de-clog and vinegar rinse thing.Did that, then a week later, I have the same problem with no water for tea or coffee coming through on the brew cycle. Called back, I'm told I'm getting a replacement. Hope it has more longevity than three months! When it works, it's great but so disappointing when you start trusting it every day for your morning coffee and you can't have any! Thank goodness I kept my little $20 Cuisinart 4 cupper.

Benson is one of the good ones. He writes of a time little visited in the imagination, the late 17th century and describes England under Charles II. Particularly, he describes the situation of Catholics and their hope for equal footing with the ruling Protestants. The politics, religious issues, the society are well portrayed. Like most early 20th century writers, Benson's pace is slower than the novelists of today.

But whoever directed this piece did a horrible job, acting is below even one star - I couldn't believe that the same actors - Helen Hunt, Sara Jessica Parker and Shannen Doherty did such good jobs on TV and in movies later in their careers. Sarah Jessica looked like she was trying waaaaay to hard, and Helen Hunt and Shannen Doherty were just... horrible. As far as the script goes... well, it was just empty.

And while _Tide's Arising_ has a polished sheen to it, I was slightly disappointed. Certainly, the broken beats on the album are crisp and quick and the production quality is strong, but I don't feel he's breaking much new ground here. The rapid fire vocals on \"Traveling\" and \"State of the Mental\" sound too similar; the grindy R&B on \"Quintessential\" and \"Heaven\" pleasantly fall by the wayside. As well, some of the shorter instrumentals sound too contemporary adult (\"Pino + Mashi,\" \"Masina's World\"). The staccato flavors of \"Syndrome,\" however, do help set that track apart, but I'm afraid the listener's interest is too apt to come and go like the tide.\nAnswer:",

My brother recommended this movie to me (he was in 8th grade and I'm in college). I went with a friend and left after half an hour to go see \"Castaway\". THis is the only movie i have EVER walked out of. I used to think that was for pissy old parents who couldn't understand the movie. I even sat through Battlefield Earth to experience what is the worst movie of the young millenium. But this thing I could not bear to watch or listen to for it's breathtaking stupidity.Anyway when I got home I ...made (my) brother ... reimburse the 8.50 I spent on this steaming hunk of crap. Honestly if the rest of my generation finds this even remotely funny or entertaining, I worry.\nAnswer:",

        "Based on this review, would the user recommend this product?\n===\nReview: I'll keep my review short and simple. This is one of my top 5 all time favorite movies. Val Kilmer should have won an Oscar for his performance, or at least received more praise. Oliver Stone knows that his story isn't 100% true and he never claimed it to be. This was his vision of The Doors, and with the help of Robbie Kreiger, Patricia Kennealy, Pamela Courson-Morrison's parents and John Densmore, he did an incredible job. However, Meg Ryan wasn't all that. She's a decent actress, but not worthy/cool enough to play Pamela Morrison. When the movie came out, Meg talked about how over-rated she thinks The Doors(the band) are and that Jim Mrrison was just a drunk. Well, Meg, why associate yourself with the movie then? Anyway, the movie is an amazing experience.\nAnswer:",

Omigawd this is so bad.\nReview: Okay lets start that I love this album. Not for its content but for the fact that it makes a great mirror. Omigawd I can not beleive that people actually bought this album. My little sis gave it to me to listen to and she told me that she wanted me to have it becuase it made her sick to listen to it. I thought that it was cute. Okay lets start out with the main purpose of this album. I feel that this album was made because they saw her as an answer to Britney, um sorry floks of the UK but didn't you already do that with Billie? Oh well I guess I can just tell you to go out to your local record store and buy a copy of Leslie Carter's single \"Like Wow\" that is worth the... to laugh your a** off for the three and a half minutes. Oh well don't buy this trash I have heard and seen better. Oh Lolly maybe your next single can be \"Viva La Cardboard Box\" since that is where you will be in the next 10 years.",

An author can't make money off of two books that have an almost exact plot, except with different character names.

Rand and Perrin are finally starting to mature (does Mat ever mature???), the story moves along at a much faster pace, and we start to see the magic and politics of the world become an integral part of the story as Jordan starts positioning all the pieces for some big action scenes.

This took away from the development of the scenery and overall plot. I thought this because the story did not have much description about the scenery so every time there was anything about scenery it was amazing, but there was not enough detail for a person to be able to imagine what the place looked like in her mind. On the other hand the overall story was wonderful the characters were well developed and the suspense was well created. Like the memory of the poachers and the elephant and the elephant's mate. Another example would be the memory of warfare.",

Both in their community and ours, citizens follow what the government says and do it without question. In this case, people don't read books. If they do, firemen burn them. It's simple, but in Ray Bradbury's account of this tale, it becomes very complex.Guy Montag, the main character/fireman, discovers that this process is wrong. Firemen should not destroy homes and books. People should be aloud to read. But what can he do?

It begins with slow, hard to follow beginning, and continues with a somewhat sped up middle with many confusing twists and new people. The end I also found to be boring. This just seemed like a short story streched out on many pages lots of new places, characters, or things in between.The parts of this book that I could follow along with were few and even still not inturesting. It took effort to read and keep everything in your head. I had to read over many things twice.If you are an advanced reader, who can keep up with many things I might suggest this to you. If you are inturested in a fantasy like story with pirates, you also may enjoy this.

His only regret is that he doesn't have more of them...It's not good for big bags\nIs this product review negative?",

I generally like OXO products and it was a comparatively expensive dish brush. I expected it to hold up way, WAY better. I feel kind of ripped off.I know there are a lot of positive reviews - that's why I ordered this particular brush in the first place. Maybe the product is being manufactured differently now or maybe a lot of people are reviewing the brush right when they first get it which is really misleading? In any case, for me, it was a total waste of money.",

The too frequent shifting points of view are unnecessary and confusing. Aside from the occasional glimmers of dry wit (not including the \"Our Ford\" joke which tires out quickly), the writing is for the most part flat. Even the orgy scenes manage to be dull. The latter half of the novel is simply a rant of Huxley's personal beliefs, all of which have been stated elsewhere and more eloquently. There are no real deep societal insights. In short, extremely overrated.",

The major character - His Majesty's Ship - is a creature who we meet at night as Russell Boyd's brilliant camera glides over and through her. We immediately are conscious of claustrophobic innards, her movement, and the complexity of her makeup manifest by the hundreds of ropes, knots, stays, that encase her, thread through her. We get a fish eye view as she weighs anchor. We listen to her groans, creaks,sighs - literally a breathing thing.Much of the joy of the novels is the attention to detail which give the works an authenticity - Peter Weir has achieved a similar success in his attention to detail.

Period. He talk-sings his way through most songs, and when he does try to actually sing, it's a pathetic attempt. Mo Tucker's voice is also a joke on the song that she sings. The songs are all 2 or 3-chord repetition, the guitars are frequently out of tune, and Tucker can't keep a steady beat to save her life.So somehow, bands that (1) can't play, (2) sing about the sleazier side of life, and (3) get ignored -- sometimes rightly -- by the public, somehow these bands rise to legendary status.

It has the usual elements: Vatican conservatives the usual bad guys vs liberal Catholics the usual good guys. The \"Third Secret\" refers to secret revelations given to Marian visionaries at such places as Fatima and Medjugorge, the existence of which is historical fact. If there is any suspense in the novel, it is not with the plot which is remarkably predictable and derivative. The only thing that kept my interest was waiting to find out the actual content of the third secret(s), at least according to the novel's author.

This slim volume features color and sepia-toned portraits of puppies snapped during the first weeks of their lives ...most keeping company with vintage or antique scales ... and all of them are simply the cat's meow! There's Lola, an 8 week-old tea cup Chihuahua, weighing in at 14 ounces. There' Scooter and Lily, a 22-pound, 6-ounce snoozing Weimaraner combo whose faces might possibly send William Wegman heading for a phone book. And there's Lurch, a 14-pound, 8-ounce brindle Dane, who, even at 8 weeks, promises to grow (and quickly) into a precious gentle giant. Montrose is not only gifted behind the lens, but in front as well, since she has managed to capture the spirits and spunk of each pampered pooch.",

It's appeal will primarily benefit those interested in the way the tracks were laid down, the underlying emotions that led to the creation of the individual songs, and hearing bits and pieces of the tracks with the other instruments removed. It's important to remember that no filming occurred in the Record Plant (their recording studio) during the sessions. The film footage that did exist was all post production concert footage; sound quality that is poor by present video based audio standards.With that said, those interested in learning how one of the most emotionally charged albums in Rocks history was created will find the DVD very gratifying. Those looking for film footage of the songs being played in their entirety will be disappointed.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

This project began in the 1950s under a study published by Karl Deutsch which looked at states that seem to have transcended security competition. However, the extension of this concept is largely ignored and it was definitely in need of some revision. This volume (which examines nascent and ascendant security communities in various regions) is an excellent primer for those wishing to familiarize themselves with the concept. Also, for scholars associated with Deustch this is a good start to \"update\" and apply Deutsch's concept.",

Although Freedman divides the chapters into the passage over, home in the new world, school, work, and play, I felt there was nothing spectacular about the text. The text does not stay with me. The pictures do. Still, a very worthwhile book. Recommended!\nAnswer:",

        "Title: Stagey, \"Bible film\" melodrama\nProduct review: I rented the movie because of a review that led me to believe the movie would educate me and provide some nuance. It's not in any way that kind of movie. Rather, it's a devotional treatment, appropriate for a Protestant religious family looking for a wholesome movie for a holiday. The opening scenes show young Luther to be so pious and important that even straightening his shirt is accompanied by pious grimaces and an entire string section. Every word out of Fiennes' mouth is delivered more hammy than a Hamlet monologue. The movie settles down into a predictable heroism (nothing extraneous to his religious bravery gets a line): all the Catholic Church is full of corrupt meanies who know they're corrupt, and every peasant cheers Luther on. It's a nicely staged Bible type movie, full of all the usual cliches, but it's about as interested in a nuance as Luther was interested in an indulgence.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Feels real good,although the porro prism design is not a small lightweight model,if you are seeking same. Good rubber coating,easy focus wheel (check its function), and relatively flat field via the hybrid plastic glass aspheric element.Decent light transmission. This is a \"genuine article\" good binocular you are likely to enjoy and use for every day and even for some backyard astronomy. I liked mine a lot before it got swiped and may buy replacement of the same kind,to add to my bino collection. The vinyl case is cheesy but that can be upgraded for twenty bucks or so.

The character development just isn't there. Anthony Hopkins, my fave actor \"ever\" is barely seen and when he is it feels like \"Instinct\" all over again. The worst part of the movie is with the \"tuh-duh\" moment (such as it is) of the movie in which the writer and director made the absolute least out of the mathematical theory written in the notebook; it just wasn't presented in a way that made it the least bit interesting to the audience. *Spoiler: And the part about the father/daughter handwriting looking the same because they spent a lot of time with each other actually made me LAUGH!Thankfully I only rented this from Netflix, and I suggest you do the same.

        "Title: Cheesy Kung-Fu Movie\nReview: This cheesy kung-fu prison movie, contrary to the box art, does not \"star\" Jackie Chan. Chan and several other Hong Kong actors (like Sammo Hung) reportedly did this as a favour to co-star and producer Jimmy Wang-Yu (\"One-Armed Swordsman,\" \"Fantasy Mission Force\"). Much of this movie is laughably bad, with goofy dialogue and entire scenes ripped-off from \"Cool Hand Luke\" of all things. Jackie Chan is in the movie for about 15 minutes.The DVD is in the aspect ratio of 1.85:1, and it looks reasonably good. The dialogue is dubbed, but it hardly seems to matter in a movie like this. There is a commentary by a martial artist and filmmaker named Phillip Rhee that is okay. His historical insights aren't fabulous, but his anecdotes about some of the films stars are enjoyable. Rounding out the extras are some cast biographies and a trailer (which, deceivingly, shows Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung as being the central characters).\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

(Both have passed away.) Trombonist Ray is heard in many big band recordings where he has done solo work, but in this album he gets to solo more extensively with a small group. Ray has often been compared to Bill Harris, but he has never been regarded as a great jazz trombonist. But who cares? He certainly is a respected trombonist and person. He doesn't embarrass himself doing these solo spots.This is a pleasant listening selection of numbers supported by Jimmie Rowles, piano; John Heard, bass; and Shelley Mann, drums. This a pretty formidable group. Zoot and Ray perform adequately while keeping the selections light and controlled. Nothing wild here. Great album to play if you're holding a dinner party.\nAnswer:",

But the main problem was that within a month, when I took the top apart to clean it,as directed, the spring popped out. I was able to get it to work again, somewhat, for a few more months after that.

A big but... 3001 starts out fantastic and I blazed through the first couple of chapters letting Mr. Clarke tell me, what appeared to be, another good story. But it would appear that Mr. Clarke didn't want to tell a story. That he only told this story because he was asked to continue his most famous story line. The worst part is that he felt that he needed to flash back to remind the reader of what happened to Mr. Poole in 2001: A Space Odyssey. If I ever feel that I need reminding of that great tome, I will dust off its well worn cover and retrace those steps. 3001 just seems unfinished. A true Clarke fan may find it interesting, but few will find it the type of book that one can return to like our other old friends on our bookshelves.\nIs this product review negative?",

It does everything we need it to do and doesn't look bad. We have hung the weight of two dryer loads of clothes on it without a problem. Those loads included three pairs of jeans.

Suffice it to say that it is a great rendition of Spiderman and well worth it for any fan to pick up. What I want to pass along is that at least now (with the most recent lower prices on each disc) it is worthwhile to actually buy these as separate volumes. If you want Season 2 (the last season) of Spectacular Spiderman you need to pick it up as four separate discs (Vol 5, 6, 7, and 8). Each disc is now priced at approximately $7 so a full season still costs more than it should have, but if you are a fan of the show I think you will think it is worth it.

I've looked at it several times and continue to enjoy the tender love story between these very different people. I don't think I've ever seen Marlena Dietrich in any other movie but I've ordered a set of several others since I liked her in this so much. I guess I always thought she was all accent and smouldering eyes but she was a very good actress and I look forward to seeing the other movies.

To be honest, after listening to it once, I don't have any great desire to listen again, mostly because the sound quality is a big step down from their previous albums. I'm not that picky in my music, but I don't want a band like Thursday to sound like the garage band down the street. Maybe the lyrics are great, but I'm just so distracted by the distinct decrease in sound quality that I can't appreciate the other parts. I would be OK if this was their first album, but it isn't, and I had some high expectations for this newest album. Unfortunately, it's not quite what I expected or what I like.",

WRONG the only thing that was like the book was the name Jodi, and even that was a lie, none of the Defoe children was named Jodi. That was an insult and the living Defoe family should sue over. the lack of taste the writers and producer had to the memory of this family that lost their lives there. The Lutzes should sue as well. This was far from the book and if the story was true...the book i mean it was not like this at all. No pig--that was what Jodi was...no red room. Nothing at all.

Although there is a downloadable patch which is meant to address this probelm (...), it didn't work on my system. And the problem multiplies - soon the animals are hungry, even though their zookeepers are right there, and should be feeding them.It seems to me that even if it HAD worked, it's a little unfair to expect users to have to go download a patch just to make the game work. Microsoft should never have released it with a problem this obvious.

But after a month, the digital reader stopped working correctly. The flimsy metal tabs that record the number of each coin type wore out quickly, so the amount shown on the digital reader is worthless. After about six months the motor jammed, and I've been unable to use it since. They make a model without the digital counter, and I would recommend that one over this one. But as far as durablility, I give it a 2. If you are only going to throw your pocket change in it, then it's great fun.

I purchased this Model which looks more like something out of sharper Image. the water container has an internal blue LED light that illuminates the water a Star Trek like blue and will flash when the water gets low. So if you like a nice big cup of Joe or tea you'll need to fill it often. Now that said, about the noise factor - this thing sucks in water and growls very loudly, like a coffee grinder. If you are filling a big mug of coffee, you will need to fill your cup twice which means the machine will have to suck water in 4 TIMES which lasts about 6 or 7 seconds. It rattles anything on the kitchen counter from the vibration frequency. Sounds great doesn't it....",

The lotion helped keep my skin nice and soft during both pregnancies. It does not feel greasy at all. This lotion is a good substitution for the \"California Baby\" skin cream that I used to use on the kids when they were infants. This is the only lotion that I'll use on my boys now..I get compliments all the time from people about their baby soft skin (they are now 2 yr & 4 yr old). Give it a try if you are looking for a \"Natural\" lotion to put on your kids..it's cheaper than buying a 2-oz jar of california baby cream which is between $ 13 -$14 a jar.

If Reader's Digest is still doing condensed versions of books, they might be able to make a readable copy of SoS, but, I, for one, have no intention of wading through this mess again. I really enjoyed the first four novels, and my copies of those are in pretty shabby condition from rereading, but this one's going to stay pristine. If you're looking for rich characterization and a top-notch story, try Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series - at least he releases a new one every couple of years.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

A caller asked what would be the best introduction to her writings, and she suggested her novel \"In America.\"This book was surprisingly disappointing to me. I kept waiting to get swept up into it, but came to the last page with only a sense of duty for finishing. The characters are drawn well enough ,the time frame (post-Civil War America) is interesting, but the book failed to engage me somehow. Sontag has an affinity for the movies and for actors;she has created as the lead character a Polish actress who finds stellar success on the American stage.I will continue to enjoy Sontag's essays but doubt I will read another of her novels.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

You come to Clarke for his speculative ideas and interesting plots. 3001 begins well enough; the ideas are abundant and the plot builds, albeit, a bit slowly. There is a bit too much of revived Discovery astronaut Frank Poole's recovery time devoted to the minutiae of fourth millennia technology. When Poole finally gets back into space and pursues the continuing mystery of the monoliths the book really gets rolling. Unfortunately, and inexplicably, Clarke rushes the conclusion, and I believe undercuts the powerful image of the Monolith he has challenged our imaginations with from the beginning of the Odyssey series. The supposed conclusion to the series leaves readers more confused than ever and trivializes one of the most potent images in sci-fi lit. Very disappointing and unsatisfying. I wish he hadn't even made the attempt.",

Please believe everyone who hated this book. What did they, glue all the previous books together? Really, the original content could maybe fill a page. The thing is, aside from the repetition and ridiculous amount of boring dialog, is that there just isn't a story here. I didn't think much of The Plains of Passage, but it least it had the man-hating tyrant and Ayla's rescue of Jondalar. There is nothing exciting in the book. Ayla's enemies sort of fade off into nothing. Like maybe something will happen in the 6th book, but really it won't be worth the paper it's printed on.Buy it (in paperback) and read it because you love Ayla (though she is less humble in this one).

Lo and behold, I came to find that the sentence, as published in this edition, is NOT what was supposed to have been written. Doubtless it is a (large) typographical error, but it changed the entire ending of the novel. Shameful to have happened, particularly for a book that markets itself towards classrooms and reading groups.The only good thing that developed from this experience is that through my research I discovered an alternate ending that Dickens had originally intended to use. Reading about the controversy between the two endings was interesting. Aladdin's nonsensical third ending was not. Further, it makes me wonder what else in the story was horribly wrong......Great novel, but don't buy it from Aladdin.

Updike, unlike Nabokov, is constantly begging the reader to pity his nasty, dull protagonists. Everything seems to go right for them, despite their best efforts to fail and feel sorry for themselves, yet we're expected to cheer them allong and cry for them when they experience minor setbacks? No thanks. Nabokov's multi-layored gems offer no easy heroes and no simple-minded moral messages. That said, I think Updike can be really good. The Centaur is a wonderfull book, and some of his short fiction is great. His serially-destributed fiction is, however, far to long-winded and thick-headed and self-serving to be compared to anything by Nabokov. If Nabokov has an American successor, it's Pynchon or Barth, not Updike.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

        "Title: Great while it lasted !!\nProduct review: We purchased this unit for Christmas of 2002. In July 2003 the player quit entirely...disc would spin but the screen was flat gray. No picture. Called Audiovox, they had no idea what the problem was and said to ship it back. Spent $10 to return via ups. They could not repair so sent a replacement. The 2nd one worked until January of 2004, then quit also. This time I was told that because the 1 year warranty had expired (from the date of purchase-not the date of replacement) I was out of luck. I could send it back for repairs at my expense. Fortunately I had the foresight to have purchased it on American Express which automatically doubles a warranty up to one year. Amex is going to refund my money so that I can purchase a new unit. The next one will definitely NOT BE AN AUDIOVOX!!\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

        "Title: Eck! Glam Trash - Ishtar in France\nReview: Never have I been so disappointed by a movie. Joan of Arc - France's patron saint - a real-life person, portrayed like a super hero. It might have worked better if they'd added the cartoon 'Sock' , 'Bam', and 'Pow' during fight scenes. All I can tell you is AFTER seeing this, I happened to catch \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" on Turner Classic Movies, and thought it was a contemporary film. I was shocked to learn the film was done in 1928! So my advice is to leave this 'glam trash Fishtar' version on the shelf, and buy the REAL DEAL instead - \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" (1928). .\nIs this product review negative?",

The fantasy appears to be thrown in just for the sake of making incidences wild and imaginary and do not seem to be relative to the story or themes.

Blu ray review.\nReview: Inspired by the true story of the legendary Lafayette Escadrille, it tells the tale of America's first fighter pilots during WWI. Of course Hollywood takes it's liberties, but it is a compliment to the courage of these men. The action and aerial fight sequences are intense and exciting. You will enjoy this film and want to learn more about these great heroes!NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: I feel the picture is clean and beautiful with the stand out scene being the Zeppelin fight. However, I was slightly disappointed with the picture. I thought it would stand out and be more vibrant, but maybe it was intentional because it is a WWI period piece. The audio was also not the best I've heard either. All the special features from the 2 disc dvd appear to be here. FINAL VERDICT: If you don't own it already get the Blu-Ray version. If you do than you can consider if you really want to upgrade. IT'S UP TO YOU!",

We reported it right away but did not follow up until near the end of the one year warranty. FAIP had us send it back to their factory. It was never fixed and returned to us. My sense is that this unit might be ok for the occasional car cleaning, but the design with the plastic cage simply can not stand up to the heat.

The best of these kinds of things mix sweet fruit with sour or salty or chocolate or something else.Not this one. It's just cloyingly sweet on top of cloyingly sweet. There are several types of dried fruit in the bag, but there's so much added suger they all taste the same. Basically, everything is a little sweeter than normal raisins. This may appeal to the kids in your house, but the adults will want to approach this stuff with caution. You might be able to make this stuff edible by mixing it yourself with other (less sweet) things, but taken as-is you'll probably consider this mix to be almost inedible in anything but modest amounts.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

The gun is very powerful and can flush drive a 9/16 staple into hard pine very nicely. However, I had a some problems with the gun. I had many miss-fires when shooting into all materials. I believe the weak spring used to advance the staples might be to blame here. My guns were also very hard to open and fill with staples. The release did not operate properly. Third was when shooting into hardboard with 1/2 staples some drove all the way in and some stood proud of the surface, making it necessary to use the hammer. The last thing was the firing handle would come out of the socket when using it and need to be relocated back in place. All time consuming and frustrating.I am still looking for a better solution.

I enjoyed it then and I enjoyed it again yesterday. This film was my introduction to Alistair MacLean. I promptly devoured all of his books and went on to Desmond Bagley and others - the early giants of the devious action/adventure/espionage/double-cross genre. All that aside, the film was excellent for its day, and has stood up well over the decades. I think I spotted a couple of minor anachronisms, all well within dramatic license. Eastwood doesn't talk much - he just kills Germans and blows things up. Richard Burton has all the dialog, but such a voice, such diction, he is always a joy to hear. I watched it as a Prime member, a free streaming video. It was a delight to find it while browsing Prime Instant Videos. Thanks, Amazon!",

Barry Egan (played by Adam Sandler) is restless, strung out, neurotic, desperate, and numb. And you are along for the ride on his emotional roller coaster. This beautiful, feeling film is NOT for jocks looking for a funny Adam Sandler movie. Furthermore, the background score is so on key with his emotions, that your nerves will be shot by the end of the movie. Emily Watson is wonderfully passionate and unusual, and Adam Sandler can no longer be viewed as strictly a comedian. Highly recommended for someone looking for a quirky, neurotic, quasi love story.",

The directors cut helps make the movie more understandable, although I would agree that the pace can be somewhat nerve racking. The few technical in-accuracies are not enough to go into here because VERY FEW movies are made totally technically accurate and if more were there would be more box office failures.Overall a good movie and the documentary makes a good learning experience on some of the technology used to make movies.Review based on Laser Disk Version END\nAnswer:",

Then later on the robots getting eaten alive by robot sharks, and the robots being melted alive in acid was a shock. But I still watched it so much I wore right through my VHS tape.

        "Title: Delightful Read!\nReview: A friend suggested I read this book as I love most things French and especially Medieval buildings. I have visited both places before but obviously did not take in the detail Adams did on his visit to them. His tales are delightful, though sometimes hard to follow. The book is intellectual but really anyone can sit down and read this and be entertained.Before reading this book I had been researching the Cathars of 11th-12th century France and this made a delightful addition to my reading on the Cathars. I recommend this book because it is stimulating, the imagery is wonderful, and it is historical.\nIs this product review negative?",

The swivel cutting head alone makes this tool special. Adjusting the head to the angle of the branch makes all the difference. You will be much more precise in your cuts. The chain ratchet is very smooth and requires less force than rope cutters. And to those who complain it does not have the capacity, I have easily cut many 1-1/4 inch branches with no problem. Ensure that the strap is adjusted so the cutters are fully open when the pull handle is retracted. I wipe the cutters after every use and apply a touch of lubricant. These are better than the others I have used. They make pruning almost a pleasure..\nAnswer:",

I tried this OXO model and was very disappointed because it just did not work. More garlic comes out the sides of the press than out the front and you have to use a knife to scrap the garlic into your dish. It is just useless with garlic splattering all over everything. I have found OXO products to be cheaply made and poorly designed.

I have been disappointed with some other CDs I have purchased listing \"The Comancheros\" which had a song rather than this theme. Many of the tracks on this two disk CD go beyond the main theme music and are actually suites. The \"Big Country\" and \"How the West Was Won\" are just a couple of examples. It may be a little more expense than some CDs, but not bad for a two disk set. I am really happy with my purchase.",

However, the lid was accidentally dropped on the kitchen tile floor and a part on the bottom cracked. From then on it was trouble. The button would push down but not come back up and start the spinning. I tried unsuccessfully to keep using it but it was more effort than it was worth.So... yes I would recommend it, but NEVER drop the plastic lid, as it's the hard type of plastic and will crack on a hard surface. The transparency of the base was really nice to see how much water had been spun out. The rubberized top button was great too.

Very useful for someone traveling to a new country for the first time. Or so I thought, until I read the portion on India. While most observations seem OK, the naming convention of Indian Muslims caught my attention. While most Muslim names used in India are derived from Arabic, I haven't seen anyone named or using 'bin' or 'binti' as in the Arab world. So my 2 cents - read it, but do check the facts before you tout about your cultural knowledge in a client meeting. But I like the analysis of cultural orientation with cognitive styles and negotiation strategies.

They are just pure fun! And that pure fun will inspire kids brought up with video games and Pokemon to go back to the basics and learn the joys of reading.Other reviews mention the need to get the second and third books in the series.

        "Title: It feels right or does not, depending...\nReview: Issues of format aside, people either love this movie or hate it, depending it seems on familiarity and acceptance of the metephore on which this movie is based. The US is rooted in English culture, a society with a singular relationship with the ocean: dark, violent, and cold - a sea so dangerous, they dug a tunnel under it. Most of the rest of western Europe, and all those shown in this movie, are connected to the Mediteranian. This creates an all together different relationship with the sea, a bright, warm, and calm place where the ocean is mother, giver of life, and the depths of the sea are the womb of the Earth. Understand and accept this relationship, and the movie makes sense - a cascade of elegant gestures. Do not and the story is but a series of weak and unrelated sub plots.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

        "Is this product review positive?\nTitle: 5 star product, minus one for packaging goofs\nReview: I'm not even sure that the folks who made the DVDs and the folks who desinged the \"contents\" part of the packaging have ever communicated with each other.The details of the goofs are available in previous reviews of this item.Despite the fact that the best parts didn't get \"unblurred\" (not that I reasonably expected it anyway), this is still a great buy. The show is still funny and irreverent and gloriously shallow.Each episode runs about 22 minutes, so why they chose to only fit 4-6 episodes on each disc is beyond me. They could have easily fit all the episodes AND bonus features on 3 discs instead of 6. But, they can charge more for a 6 disc set, so....No matter the price (the extra, needless $$ spent on this would have been lost to the sands of time eventually anyway), The Man Show DVD sets remain my favorite DVD purchases of the year!Looking forward to Seasons 3 and 4.Season Five with the new hosts?

If this had any effect on my life, it made me appreciate where and how I live my life. The book itself was very well written and entertaining. The beginning of the book was depressing to the point where I didn't want to read it, but as I progressed, I started to enjoy it. It was very difficult to emphasize with Winston because I cannot imagine the world he lives in. As I reflect on the book as a whole, I realize that it was more than worth my time to read.

Been using a more expensive (cost twice as much as the Sony) 900 MHz wireless headphones (Radioshack) for the last 8 years.The Sony wireless are MUCH better! The range is outstanding. I have a large 2 level home, can walk all over the home without any static. Sound quality is very good wired direct to the HDTV. Love the auto switch and no cable to plug hookup to charge the batteries. Just set the headset on the stand... now that's neat! And the batteries will last longer than I care to use them. Great product for the cost, I should have had them before now.Only one complaint... some times I hear a loud sharp click or crack.

Anthony Anderson was the only character that I truly liked in the movie. His attitude and playful posturings was a refreshing change of pace to the (numerous) annoying crying and whining scenes. I have to ask one question to Morris: Why did you do this movie? Are you that desperate for money? Are time really that bad? It started off really bad, but got interesting towards the middle, then it ended predictably. Hands down one of the worst of the new \"blackploitative\" films of our era.

Vocals come through clearer; ideas are more obvious. It's a real testament to their musicianship/professionalism that the songs are so similar in demo and final form. Clearly, they are their own producers, rather than pretty faced fools who let others turn their songs into hits. Have some heart, pundits. They need the money. I read a long (and entertaining) interview where they described how much it cost to rent the orchestra for one day. It wiped out almost all the money they had. Yes, their own money.

Pearl Jam were NOT meant to be a psychedelic/acoustic group at all.

She loved it immediately. She chases squirrels in the yard, so we thought this would be a good substitute. It does look like a squirrel, have a nice crinkly tail and a nice squeaker.But, within 15 minutes, she had surgically removed the crinkler from the tail. Another 5 minutes, and she removed the squeaker. She managed to do both without removing any stuffing (she's talented), but that was next.The weak point of this toy is that the big, bushy tail is stitched all the way from the squirrel's rearend to halfway up his back. So, a dog that's apt with his or her forepaws can easily hold it down and rend with her teeth (which is exactly what our dog did).Lola loves stuffed toys, but they don't last long.

My favorites were \"Get used to it\" no.3 & \"We won't stop\" no.6. The 8th joint takes a thinly veiled shot at the techno enhanced music of the day. On the 7th cut they actually mention how they were attempting to bring funk back into music. N'dea returned with superb vocals after a long hiatus.

        "Title: Does NOT work\nReview: The PodiumPad by Road Tools (rebranded as Targus) is the big sibling of Coolpad. Basically it just has adjustable rubber balls as opposed to fixed ones on the Coolpad. Neither one works at all when it comes down to cooling down your laptop computer. It's also very inconvenient to type on the laptop when placed on the Podiumpad, and adjusting the height of the rubber thingies is a pain. Do not waste your money. Search for a product called Bytecc Notebook Cooler ...which is cheaper and has built-in fans which actually cool down your computer.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

And the Academy of Motion Pictures must agree since it gave Gladiator 5 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Actor (Russell Crowe.) It is a great epic film with sweeping views of Rome(should have won the Cinematography Oscar over that Tiger movie), and a good storyline. The battle scenes can be a bit violent, but NOTHING like the likes of Saving Private Ryan. This is perhaps the greatest DVD in my collection, and one of my favorite films of all time. The DTS sound is incredible. The Special Features will keep you entertained for days. If you are a DVD buff, you MUST own this movie. If you just love movies you MUST own this movie.

As a parent, I love the fact that it gives off enough light to use as a night light should one have to check on their baby at night time.My son has had this since he's been 3 years old and it seems to help him drift off to sleep again should he waken in the middle of the night.The only draw back is that it seems to go through the batteries rather quickly.

It shows his humility, his struggles with the devil, and everything an orthodox Catholic and Christian would want out of a film. It doesn't overlook the temporal problems of the Catholic Church such as the pride, jealousy, and vindictiveness of the powerful opponents of Padre Pio, but it portrays this not as if most of these opponents were evil, but simply that they did not understand, and even in Padre Pio's words they were simply trying to protect the Church. The importance of the three religious vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience come to the forefront in this film in many ways.

It's also a modern country album, but retains a little bit of traditional country. \"Ashes By Now\" and \"Does My Ring Burn Your Finger\" are traditional, but not too traditional for me to enjoy.\"Does My Ring Burn Your Finger\" is the best song on the album and my favorite; the opening guitar work in the beginning is so magnificent that I keep putting that part on repeat, and her drawl expresses the attitude in the song. I love sassy attitude songs. :)The rest of the songs have enjoyable melodies except for \"Lonely Too,\" which doesn't stand out. \"The Healing Kind,\" \"Why They Call It Falling,\" and \"Stronger Than I Am\" are especially touching ballads.This is a very smooth album and it keeps the mellow mood throughout, even on the faster tempo songs.

What a disappointment. While their previous two studio records showed occasional flashes of musical and vocal greatness, this album sets them back miles, catering to every beats-to-the-wall formula that is saturating radio airwaves and in the process rendering nearly every song a futile exercise in staccato riffs and loud, obnoxious drum programming. Only on the Maurice Joshua remix of 'So Good' does the music show any signs of joy and life. And the Michelle Williams track tacked on at the end only further strengthens what many have always believed--both Williams and Kelly Rowland would do wise to leave the singing to Beyonce Knowles and continue in their roles as highly paid background vocalists--nuff said.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

From what I understand, Bradbury sat in a library and wrote it in a few weeks, and it shows. Montag is introduced as a man happy in his job. The meeting with Clarisse blows his mind! But then Bradbury throws in numerous details indicating that his dissatisfaction has been mounting for some time. Although Montag is purportedly of a divided mind, the development of his character is very abrupt and unconvincing. But why develop what is essentially a mouthpiece for your own ranting? Blech. Bradbury's ideas have come to fruition in our time, but, ironically, his own work is not literature at all. I do not understand why this work is lauded as a classic.",

In this movie DeNiro plays a wild young man who is trying to still find acceptance and trust in his older and much wiser collegue and caretaker(Keital), but this movie should not be in any mob movie collector unless you just want it cuz everyone else says so. This movie doesn't really hold up in today's movies. I mean i really appreciate other movies made during this era...like Deer Hunter, Taxi Driver,Chinatown, etc......Those movies should all be in any collector's collection. This movie is slow and the only thing that gives it a glimmer of interest....is the acting done by DeNiro and Keital......Buy this movie if you want to finish your DeNiro collection.....but that should be the only reason you buy it for.\nAnswer:",

Yes, the book was written over 100 years ago, but it deals with Single mothers in a two-parent society and how the outsiders to the situation (townspeople) deal with Hestor Prynne and her daughter, Pearl. Even today we seem to look down upon single mothers as nothings, even though they are doing the best they can to raise their child(ren) and to survive themselves. Nathaniel Hawthorne seems to be writing about not only the early settlers, but also about HIS time and OUR time all in the same book. I give it five stars because of it's beautiful discription of the trials and tribulations of single-parenthood.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

The book reminds me of 'The Giving Tree' by Shel Silverstein. I loved that book as a child and keep it on my bookshelf today. As with 'The Giving Tree', there's a moral behind the story of Maxime and Ariel's adventure with the 'whale with a polka-dot tail.' It seems to me that the author is conveying that while we may all have the inevitable 'grass is greener' syndrome, we have plenty to be content with. Our family and friends are the true source of happiness! Now that's refreshing!\nAnswer:",

The text is wonderful, full of ironies and dramatic scenes - for example, the scene where Elizabeth lies for the first time in her life to save Proctor's reputation, only to realise that her good intentions have unwittingly helped Abigail. Land wars, revenge and a host of other reasons show us the repressed state Salem was in in those days. The relationships between the main characters : Proctor, Parris, Abigail, etc, were understandable and one could actually feel himself or herself praying that a particular character would survive the madness, or feel sympathy for even the villains. The Crucible was a great experience for me, and I hope that via this review many of you out there will go and buy this book to see what I mean.",

As controversial as this process has been with Tangerine Dream, Froese has jumped into the blueprint for change with his solo catalog.While Froese has constantly shown an evolving artistry, the original four numbers - clocking 43:09 - were fascinating in what they represented in their original form (which was some of the best music by Froese).

As early as the Council of Ancyra (314 A.D.) the Church spoke juridically against those \"who.. commit [acts of] defilement with animals or males.\" Certainly that the Church spoke in different terms, even in circumlocutions, to avoid describing acts so foul against Christian morality provides no \"cover\" for the sin.

I think that it has also strenghened many of my beleifs because I now realize how important they are in life. Everyone should read this book\nAnswer:",

However, we do need to keep in mind that this is supposed to be a coloring book, target audience probably children though frankly I know many adults who adore these sorts of books. The images however not simple black and white lines drawings but have shading and that interfers with coloring. Also many of the images are \"blurry\" or so details that I don't think it is much fun to color. But it could be a cool reference for clip art or examples of the gothic style.\nAnswer:",

When I lowered it, the skin around her mouth was blue.We tried it again 3 weeks later, when she was a bit bigger. Initially, it seemed fine but within a few minutes, it slid up to cover her mouth and nose again.I would not recommend this product.

I will admit that this is not his best performance and I would also agree with the majority of the reviews written that Rachel Weisz gave the best performance in the entire movie (she is that good).

You only need to flip through a history book to see the horrible things people have done to other people. But to read about twelve year old boys killing each other is really sick. And that's what it is: a bunch of young boys are stuck on an island, they start off somewhat organized, and then, one by one, turn savage.My best friend recommended it to me, saying the ending was amazing. Perhaps it is. It is a sudden let down from the tension. Yes, I agree, it is amazingly written, but it is also hopeless. What life is left for the boys? They'll need a lot of visits to the shrink, I expect.But that's not what it's about. We are not supposed to think of the long term, only be aware of the depravity of the human race. Anyway, that's what I got out of it. And I am glad I read it - if only to say that I read it and now sort of know what the fuss is all about.",

So how did they wind up in this stilted, overproduced piece of jetsam? I should know by now that any film written or directed by Nancy Meyers is going to stink, but somehow I watched this one anyhow. Big mistake! Every scene feels contrived; you can just see the writers going \"now comes the scene where.... \"If the same premise had been developed by the \"Seinfeld\" team, it could have been hilarious. As-is, it's heavy-handed and moralizing through and through. And Gibson gives his hammiest performance since ... well, ever. Ugh!

I've tried to watch it a few times over the past 10 years or so and come dangerously close to falling asleep each time-I'm not exaggerating.The films special effects (which the film relied too much on) and musical score are astounding, however. If it weren't for those 2 elements, I would only give the film one star. The first 30 minutes are entertaining, but from there it goes straight downhill. Despite all of \"Star Trek V\"'s flaws, at least it wasn't boaring as \"TMP\" was.I do plan to purchase the film on DVD solely due to the fact that I want to see the theatrical trailer.

Not only are the characters shallow and undeveloped, the plot thin, but the actual writing is terrible. It seems there at least three exclamation points per paragraph. \"I'm sure confused! This is the future! That's nice!\"I think that Clarke must have a grandson or something who is learning how to write and used his grandpa's name on this book.\nIs this product review negative?",

The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO. I brought it back to the store for a refund.

All in all, I feel like Misery Signals has done a great job exhibiting how much they have grown as a band and musically on this CD.Some of their older stuff is just classic though and always will be.I feel that the 7 Angels 7 Plagues style has definatley come out in some songs on the CD.World's and Dreams is quite reminiscent of Jhazymne's Lullaby or Dandelions.In the end,I highly reccomend this CD for diehard M.S. fans such as I,or even newcomers to the melodic hardcore genre.Misery Signals is definatley at the top of their game.",

I'm sorry, but I'm not sure how page after page of descriptions of life under the nazis is supposed to help anyone with anything. I was already aware that many people have had to go through even worse things than watching a beloved spouse die of cancer, awful as that is. Certainly Mr. Frankel's experience and response to it is a tribute to the human spirit -- proof that we are more resillient than we think. But uplifting? No, I don't think so. Depressing, with no new information, is my synopsis. More power to those who can comfort themselves with some \"meaning\" in suffering and get something out of this book.

You then have to go to iChat preferences to switch this annoying 'feature' off but this doesn't seem to be documented.To summarize, it is a camera for chats, best used at 160x120, and it is four times the price of its competitors.

For starters, the US Version's Music Score surpasses the European Score by leapyears and this Director's Cut uses that cheesy synthesizery European Score. :-( Secondly, the additional footage simply adds a little more pointless skin in the form of nudity, but adds little or nothing to the overall story except about 50 minutes of your time. It feels like it's dragging compared to the original US Version and often gives you more information than you wanted - sometimes it's best to not tell the audience everything and let them fill in the blanks themselves. The original US Version is one of my favorite films of all times, but this updated Director's Version doesn't make my cut because the extra stuff is pointless and long and the European Soundtrack is horrible!!!",

This book doesn't come close to those four when the target audience is a newbie.

This movie was borderline Hitchcock style murder mystery and very smoothly done. Just a little stronger acting by Ben Chaplin and Ryan Gosling and it would have been a major hit. They do a good job but they are not the caliber of Ed Norton in \"Primal Fear\". If they were they would have got at least oscar nominations if not awards. I still think they turn in fine performances and were not appreciated. I personally think the whole movie was underrated. I think it improves with additional viewings. You begin to truly appreciate the performances and the story. A Hitchcock air about it that makes you think of \"The Rope\" and \"Vertigo\". I bought the DVD and I recommend it.

Either way: 1) I tried it without tape and hand tightened, and it leaked; 2) tried to tighten it with pliers, still leaked (worse); 3) took the vacuum breaker off and it still leaked (in two places now); put the vaccum breaker back on and put tephlon tape on the male threads and hand tightened, it leaked; 4) left tape on and tightened with pliers, you guessed it... it leaked.

I bought the razor for my fiance's birthday, as he has long spoken of wanting to switch from disposables to a straight razor for the allure of A) fiscal and environmental practicality, and B) the machismo of Good Ol' Fashioned MAN skill. ;) However, the razor arrived DULL. So dull, the strop (which I also purchased) did nothing. So dull we had to go out and buy a sharpener. So very, extremely, incredibly dull, that after days and nights (MANY) of my fiance sitting down and sharpening for hours on end, until his fingers and hands would cramp, it still was far from usable on his (really not that stubborn) facial hair. While this may be the nature of the beast, perhaps it should have come with a warning that this razor is, as it comes, really more for show than use, and if it is to be used as intended (as a shaving device) what to expect: disappointment.\nAnswer:",

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product?\nReview title: Holiday Memories from the 39th President\nProduct review: In the short \"Christmas in Plains\" Jimmy Carter shares mermories from a lifetime of very disparate Christmases. He remembers childhood holidays in rural Georgia where his young African-American neighbors might get an orange and some raisins. He recalls the four Christmases he spent as President. A very religious and family-oriented man, Carter has alsways treasured the birth of Christ as one of the highlights of his year. Easily read in one night this is a charming little book. To better understand this complicated and important man, a fuller read is last year's \"An Hour Before Daylight\" which is a more thorough memoir of his childhood years. But \"Christmas in Plains\" stands on its own: a charming, sometimes heartwarming account of a good man and his 70+ Christmases. This deserves to become a minor holiday classic--unlike, say, Grisham's new \"Skipping Christmas\".",

Their first album is really the only one you should buy of theirs, because their subsequent ones have just paled in comparison. This one in particular is the worst one they've ever done. I feel sorry for those people who say this one is their best. They obviously are not right in the head and need to learn to think more clearly. This album is pure garbage and anyone should be smart enough to realize that. In fact I believe that this one album being as popular as it is signifies America's downfall and God help us all if this album continues to be a hit. Please I beg anyone reading this review to not help America continue it's downward spiral into the toilet. This album should be outlawed as soon as possible. Thank you for your time.",

        "Is this product review positive?\nTitle: Even the shortest game can succeed.\nReview: Ducktales is one of the very few games that prove that even the shortest game can succeed. There's only 5 levels, and you repeat 1, but those 5 levels are lengthy.The plot is that Scrooge McDuck, the richest duck in the world, wants to be even richer by traveling around the world, finding treasures.You can go to Transylvania, the Amazon, the Moon, the Himalayas, and the African Mines.Ducktales shares certain similarities to MegaMan, like the level selection, how the levels scroll when you fall, and how there's a boss at the end of every level. In fact, Capcom made this game.The game is a nice side-scrolling platformer with impressive graphics and upbeat Capcom sounds and music.\nAnswer:",

The atmosphere evoked visually and musically does full service to both the intricacies and shading of the opera, and to the psychological ambiguities of the plot and characters.

This CG bill shut is an outrage to humanity. His rolling waveface accompanied by Assanti's pitiful attempt to weep provides an outstanding performance which may (being optimistic) top the emotion found in a dramatic episode of Mr. Rogers. I am certain that if poor old (really old) Homer were given a second life to live in this century, he would probably waste it by inflicting himself with chimera. With all due respect, though none is due, this film is pathetic. That's all I have to say.

Its worth the price.Positive points: Food doesn't stick to the pots/pansYou get varieties of sizes.Easy to clean.Looks smart.Negative points: I feel the handles are little delicate, so we have to give support if the stockpot is completely filledThe mixing bowls are quite thin.

My baby can splash in the netted area between the floats and can easely kick his feet. He paddles all over the pool and can actually play with the other kids because he can go where he wants. Of course you monitor them at all times, but we have had no panic episodes with this product and the baby paddles around like a little duck and happy as a clam.

(It was able to play a different one with about 150 MP3s.) A much cheaper unit was able to play both CDs, but skipped, which was what brought me to look at this one.Loading the CD-RW with 65 MP3s caused the unit to spin up, show that it was reading an MP3 disc, count to 65, and then suddenly shut itself off when it should have started playing. Two different units in two different stores showed this exact behavior. I was unable to figure out what the difference was between the two CD-RWs that caused this to happen.Bottom line: buyer beware! This unit looks cool and the navigation works well, but it could easily end up disappointing you when you bring it home to play your MP3s.

I am still trying to understand it now. I thought the book was confusing but still interesting when I did get pulled into the stories of the 5 victims. I think it is a book that should be taught and not just read. You need to have an appreciation for this book, that I obviously have not aquired yet. This book would be better for middle age adults, but kids could give it a try if they are prepared to be thoroughly lost in a novel. Who knows, some people may love this book and say it is the best ever written. But in my opinion, I do not see the point it is trying to make at all.",

        "Title: **Hooray**For the Symbolism...**Boo**For the Plot\nReview: A very trippy novel filled with Freudian imagery! The explicit erotic fantasies and \"bitchiness\" of the main character, Isadora Wing, were entertaining. However, I found it to be very depressing in general. Although it is refreshing to see a female author write with such sexual inhibition....the plot seems to be lacking realism. Isadora actually made me nauseous at times with her bad selection of boy toys! I think a visit from the personal hygeine fairy would have been nice. She was definitely a woman who was playing with a few cards short of a full deck! In my opinion the first few chapters were the best...and the conclusion was disappointing and left me wanting more closure between Isadora & her husband!\nIs the review positive or negative?",

I was blown away especially by the character of Lee since he plays such an important role in the novel and he's Chinese. At the time of the novel and its publication, I could not think of characters in novels or in film where minorities were not caricatures or stereotypically portrayed, so I was really surprised to find Lee so well drawn out. He was such a significant moral force in the story.I've read Steinbeck's other work and this is his masterpiece. For 600 pages, you get to live with these characters and it's sad when the book ends. The only thing to do is to reread and it's definitely one of those books worth rereading.\nIs this product review negative?",

The new version with Patrick Stewart had it's moments, but Peck as Father Maple looked like he was in a daze and didn't know where he was (or who he was) Peck's performance was rather disturbing. The actor who played Quee-Queg in this newer version was more like a cartoon. The actor in the 1950's version was far more convincing.Patrick Stewart wasn't a bad choice for Ahab, but to me it was more like Stewart PLAYING AHAB v.s. BEING THE CHARACTER. I kept expecting him to shout \"ENGAGE\" rather than \"THERE SHE BLOWS\".For students of the book, the original 1950 version was closer to the text. This new version had far too many added bits for the purist. If you enjoy remakes, (I don't know why) then go for it. If you are a stickler for detail, pass it\nAnswer:",

Halfway through the book I couldn't wait for it to end, not because I really wanted to know what was going to happen, but because I felt I was wasting valuable time living! After reading it, I thought Laymon might be a new author still trying to find his style, but then I caught a glimpse of his picture and bio on the inside back cover and - oh my! If you're looking for some classic horror, I'd suggest Stephen King's PET SEMATARY, Richard Matheson's I AM LEGEND, or some newer authors like J.G. Passarella's WITHER and Ronald Damien Malfi's THE SPACE BETWEEN (more sci-fi, still a good book). Whatever you choose, I would not recommend this book!\nAnswer:",

However, Wishville shows that Catherine Wheel's ideas appear to be running slighty thin. The atmospheric rock of Chrome, the hard edge of Happy Days, and the cohesiveness of Adam and Eve are nowhere to be found here. Instead, there are just 9 songs, almost all of which go along at a sleep-inducing pace. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this effort, primarily because there is no other band out there like Catherine Wheel, and for this very fact, I was expecting a lot better.",

It also does not help the film that the director does not know how to shot a scene and the special effects are bottom of the barrel for a movie of this kind. Rachel Weisz is great but she's the only actor who seems like she gives a damn about her performance While the rest seem like they are sleepwalking.If you love to look at your watch for two hours waiting for this movie to end, be my guess.

It's sheer trash and I mean trash too. I haven't figured out yet why so many people are shown naked or with half their clothes off. One can only assume it's the director's idea. Why does Jennifer Jason Leigh go nude for half the picture? It makes no sense and neither does most of the film. There are just some disturbing images like a horrible pregnant woman running around acting crude and people writhing (of course) naked after being sliced in the head, dogs cut up and catipulted into a castle! It's just a pretty stupid movie. I'm just sorry it isn't a \"lost\" film where all copies known to exist just evaporated into thin air. A better movie that takes place a few decades before this one which takes place in 1501 isThe Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

It wasn't anything racist because the Academy normally bestows Oscars to actors for the WRONG performances (Al Pacino for SCENT OF A WOMAN? Paul Newman for THE COLOR OF MONEY? Forget about it!).The only real problem I had was with the way Spike Lee chose to end the film.He spends three hours telling the very raw human story of how Malcolm X lived and died--and then tacks on what feels like a recruitment film that worships the image of the man, the kind of deification that might have made Malcolm uneasy. And made me think the filmmakers may have missed the point.Still, a great biography.\nAnswer:",

I expected informative and interesting descriptions of the desert southwest, and there is some of this. However, the author gets so carried away with inappropriate political discussion and criticism of almost everyone and everything, it really detracts from the story. I actual skipped through some of these parts. When he does stay with the natural descriptions, the author is knowledgable and actually quite poetic. Some of his descriptions are over-the-top though with tedious classical and cultural references. Would not recommend this book. I'm sure there are much better books with stories and information on the desert that avoid the political extremism.\nAnswer:",

I use to watch this with my brothers. The special effects (for 1978) were not that bad. To be honest I was acctually impressed. I enjoyed some of the interviews on this dvd as well. I had know clue the daggit was a monkey. The guest stars were amazing. I also give Terry Carter a lot of credit for his role as Colnel Tigh. For 1978 it still must have been hard to play an African American officer and he did it well.",

It's a catchy song and it gets you pumped for another album by them but the rest of the album is terrible. The music clips which I refered to are just the introductions to the songs which change after the first seven seconds into empty, yet overblown songs which don't have any replay value.Then, there's a syrupy ballad in the mix too which makes me lose a bit of respect for Scott Weiland and co. seeing as how it doesn't belong at all.

Angie floats around, mostly in a paranoid state, in and out of hospitals, group homes and her own home. Luke leaves college, leaves his girlfriend, drifts around for a while, then gets back with his girlfriend and goes back home (doing what, I'm not sure - the book wasn't clear on that). Pieter keeps playing his cello and wallowing in self pity. And Jordana never fully copes or even comes to term with Angie's illness. She is also drifting.This may be reality, but it is an extremely depressing reality. I have read \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and loved it.

        "Title: How Could You Not Love This Little Gem [grownup or otherwise]\nProduct review: More than 5 stars worth. Beyond delightful. Creative, imaginative. Great voices, wonderful selections to hear and see. The kids are impressive in their grasp and ability to talk about poetry - the depth of understanding and the ability to articulate both the understanding and how poems make them feel...so good that I had to stop the dvd a few times to take it in. The adult voices - actors and the poets themselves - and the voices of the kids mesh perfectly. Am ordering a copy for a birthday gift for a 6 year old and would not object if someone gave me a copy for my birthday. A half hour of pure delight.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

It works well with the Holmes cannon (there are several references dropped for those familiar with Holmes) and the story is a lot of fun. The symptoms of cocaine withdrawal are not accurate (they more closely resemble alcohol withdrawal) but that's probably for dramatic effect. I'm glad this is back in print and at a reasonable price.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

It cintained 49% inert ingredients in addition to the grass seed.So in addition to the extra ingredients that I did not order I only got aboit 4.5 lbs/ of grass seed, not the 6 lbs. that I ordered and the seed mixture is not much different than what is available at your local hardware store. I ordered this on 2/6/2013 and received it yesterday 2/19/2013.I have not planted the seed yet because of our cold upstste weather, but from other reviews that I have read I am not expexting much from th product or the Company selling it.

        "Title: Absolutely terrible!\nReview: I have read Jane Austen over and over for years, and really enjoyed the \"modern\" movies Sense & Sensibility, Emma, and Pride and Prejudice (with Keira Knightley, although I think they treated it more like a dramatization of a Charlotte Bronte novel than Jane Austen). I was really looking forward to this movie, but when I was finished watching, I felt incredibly disappointed. Tom Lefroy was portrayed as a jerk, who seemed to have no real appreciation of Jane as a person, but just saw her as a woman to conquer. Jane was an idiot and I never could figure out what she was supposed to see in the guy. The sexual innuendos were thoroughly 2007, and stuck out like a sore thumb. I tried the movie again a second time, and couldn't get through it. Next time I'll stick to my previous rule - rent before you buy! A total waste.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

Maybe Russell has a cheaper line of clothing to fill a low price niche.These shorts don't look very stylish. They are a boxy looking cut with no real shape to them.Material is just OK and not very soft feeling. Hems are OK, I guess, but don't look like anything special; I won't be surprised if the hems begin to unravel. The Russell logo is an iron-on as opposed to the stich-on that they have used on other lines.Be aware that they are an 8\" inseam so, depending on your height, they might not reach the knee.They look a size larger then tagged.I got these on an Amazon special price of $4.03. I wouldn't pay more for them after seeing them.For me they're OK for hanging around the house or for warm weather sleepwear.

There is a vocal bridge that I wish Queen would've kept in and the song is done in the \"self help\" vain...it begins with a soothing voice over with a man urging you to \"close your eyes and imagine soft, white clouds..\"\"Love Lies Bleeding\" has a catchy guitar riff courtesy of guesting Brian May but all in all, this is Euro pop at it's worst.\nAnswer:",

Her children are grown, one in college and one in China for two years. Her husband, Tom, works in Washington, DC and returns to his home in Atlanta only on weekends. The book starts on Katharine's 46th birthday.The characters in this book are very well drawn and the plot situations are realistic. One likes the protagonist and her family and friends. Reading the first book made me want to read the second, \"Sins of the Fathers,\" which I have done. Again I like the descriptions and the characters.I do have a problem with the mystery part of these books. I have some trouble understanding the motives of the murderers. Perhaps the author could have Katherine explain it all at the end to her husband, Tom, or her son in China. I will keep reading the books.

        "Title: A biased but sound read\nProduct review: This book mostly looks at the racial aspects of the colonization and founding of Australia. Most chapter headings indicate the views of the colonists as being very anti Aboriginal. Although the account is biased and highly subjective it lends itself to a very interesting read, one that any scholar of Australia or the far east and especially anyone interested in Indian-white relations will enjoy. The book details the original encounters with the natives as well as contemporary native issues, such as the 1988 bicentennial of the founding in which a massive wave of Aboriginal protest swept the nation to draw attention to the plight. Of course parallels with American Indians are everywhere. A very interesting book, although `Fatal Shore' is probably a superior and less anti-European account.Seth J.

When he was younger (9 months now) I would turn it on and it would amuse him and he would fall asleep. As he got older, he pretty much slept through the night but would sometimes wake up. He would turn this aquarium on with his feet and watch it and fall back to sleep. He is 9 months now and still loves it. When it is time for bed, I put him in his crib and turn this on and it distracts him so I can exit the room with no tears! I only wish it played a little longer (5 min. now).

The DVD has 4 episodes-NOT the 8 that amazon advertises. The DVD extras include the english actors interviews and recording sessions and theres director commentary-a bunch of boring stuff mostly. If you've read the manga and enjoyed it you'll be happy to know that the anime has stayed true to story-unlike the live action movie. The english voice acting is good overall-nothing to get to excited about, and the art itself isn't wow but its not cheap either-takes after the book art.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

Now it's 4AM and I've spent 2 hours troubleshooting the printer only to have it dead.To top it off this printer uses the HP #15 cartridge which is a #45 cartridge with half the ink at the same price.. you cannot use a #45 in this printer.I highly reccomend against buying this printer. Not only is it subject to the expensive ink cartridges but it has been widely known for paper feeder problems (a school district recalled theirs), and they are all eventually prone to this sort of failure.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

I've had it for over 3 years now and it got me through the blackout of '03 without running out of juice. The sound is beautiful. And the design is so sexy and clean looking. But the plastic coating peels in a very unattractive way. I exchanged my first one for a new one because it was such a mess after a year, but the second one did the same thing. I like to move it from room to room throughout the day and the coating on area where the indents are for picking up gets separated and begins to peel away. Very disappointing on such an otherwise sweet box. If you can't carry it around without messing up the finish, then it isn't really very PORTABLE is it??\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

So now I have a camera that doesn't work and also the guilt of having to find a safe way to get rid of this thing so that it is not clogging up a landfill somewhere. I won't be buying any Panasonic products again.I think I am going to go back to low tech and just build a pin hole camera until the manufacturers can build a camera that will last more than a few years with the expected abuses that a camera will experience.

This made-for-TV adaptation makes me wonder if the screenwriters and director even read the original book. Not only is the character of Queegueg depicted incorrectly as a Mauri of New Zealand (in reality Melville based the character on the Nuku-Hivans), but he is treated as a buffoonish and stereotypical \"savage\" which is completely at odds with the dignified character that Melville created. Additionally, the filmmakers dreamt up a bizarre scene where the Pequod is stranded in the ice of the Antarctic! They must have been reading Mary Shelly's Frankenstien at the time. Patrick Stewart's performance as Ahab however, is wonderful, but that's the only redeeming feature of this overblown mess.\nAnswer:",

And this CD really isn't that bad. But it isn't that good either. I can be a Clay fanatic and say it's wonderful and perfect but technically there's really nothing there. Every song sounds exactly the same. As I listened to the album I grew extremely bored because I felt like I was listening to one very looooooooong song. Clay is great when you listen to him in doses but song after song of the same melodies with his detached and emotionless voice just gets dull. And I hate what they did to his voice in most of the songs. You can easily tell they ran his vocals through a computer. He has a great voice. They should leave it alone. Maybe in the future when he has more control over his career, if he has a career, he can do things his way.The weakest song on the album is \"Measure of a Man.\" That's pure dribble.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied?\nTitle: Good story but Over Rated!\nReview: I am not saying that this is a bad movie or bad story... not at all. But here are the disappointments that might hit you:1. One of things that might disappoint the audience is that it cannot be easily swallowed after Russel's great movie \"Gladiator\". 2. Second when you say Al Pacino, we remember his greatests \"Heat\" or \"Devil's Advocate\". So this movie does not easily fit with many of his great movies.So the success of this movie is no more determined by the actors past successful history, but only if the story is good or not. And yes the story was good and had its certain type of suspense but it gets in a frame that we all knew about this story and now it has got out.In other words, we always believed that smoking cigarettes is an addiction. No this film told us why and how. So it's not new, but now it is out.I see that this type of story needed not such expensive great actors except to attract more audience!",

        "Is this product review positive?\nTitle: Three-room boredom\nReview: How incredibly dull! What poor character development! Miller has to develop his characters through long, boring paragraphs instead of just allowing them to speak and define their personalities that way. This guy should take a hint from Shakespeare (specifically, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar): develop characters by what they say and the way they say it. And then, on top of a slow plot and dry story line, Miller has the tenacity to set the entire play in only four or five rooms. For two acts they are in Betty's bedroom and Procter's living room. This book is a sleeper. But I do commend the grammar and sentence structure he used to at least make the characters seem like they're from New England in the 1600's.\nAnswer:",

This was the weakest coffee (really slightly tinted brown water) that we have ever tried. After the first K-cup, we tried, the coffee was so weak, I thought that I had done something wrong. And the coffee tasted like hot water. So I made a second cup and watched the coffee as it came out of the Keurig. The last half of the brew was just clear water..... Terrible.So I grabbed a Green Mountain K-Cup and shook it. I could hear the coffee moving around inside and felt the weight compared the Gloria Jean. No comparison, The Gloria Jean was as light as a feather.We packed up the rest of the box and sent it back. I don't know what to make of this.

Bobs voice is just as awesome in person as on a CD. There is not one song on the new CD that you won't like. I have my favorites like \"SO WRONG\",\"TEMPORARY LIFE\" and \"Fortunate\". But the other 7 songs are great too and I don't think I have ever skipped over one song while playing the CD.

Actually, the first side of the album featured all the songs from the film. The second side contained the a and b sides of all the singles the Beatles released in 1967 (other than \"I am the Walrus\", which was on the first side of the album). There are a lot of great songs here, of course, but the album doesn't hold up that well as a cohesive unit. It feels more like a collection of songs than an actual album. Of course, you can't complain too much when you get great songs like \"I am the Walrus\", \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"Penny Lane\" and \"All You Need is Love\". The one track I will criticize is \"Flying\". I hope my fellow Beatlemaniacs will forgive me, but I have to say that this is one of the boringest instrumentals ever recorded.

It lacks imagination, which is the backbone of all good science fiction books. The book starts slow and is predictable all the way through. The only exception to this is to believe that dinosaurs are recreated, via cloning, to be domesticated servants.This book lacked intrigue, suspense and the dramatic finish that the initial concept of 2001 offered. The characters lack substance and the dialogue between characters was at the level of young children.Here is a typical passage: Do I detect a hint of sarcasm? Thanks to our computers, we can run political experiments in cyberspace before trying them out in practice. Lenin was unlucky: he was born a hundred years too soon.

It includes Adam's original prayers, as well as classic prayers, well known and unknown, from sources as diverse as the Carmina Gadelica, the Alternative Service Book of the Church of England, Evelyn Underhill, and a manual for private prayer published in 1559.

I found it to be a good way to compare the different methods, contrary to the previous review. The book doesn't make judgments, and also includes information on different medical interventions available, including epidurals and other drugs, as well as a section on C-section deliveries. Based on the information in this excellent book, I chose to take a HypnoBirthing class, because I felt that it best suited my needs. I was able to have a wonderful natural childbirth experience (with a certified Nurse-Midwife) as a result of carefully researching my options.

Great story, great casting, great acting & great period film making. Diane Lane is not to shabby either as a strippin' diva with a taste for the fast life. Matt Dillon plays a complete craps stud who can win any dice game no matter the stakes or cash on the table. Tommy Lee Jones, Tom Skerrit, Bruce Dern & Lee Grant all contribute with awesome performances to this \"Gem Club\" of a movie. I sincerely hope we'll all be lucky enough for this title to be available soon on DVD. Heck, I'd love to have a DVD with tons of extras too if it was up to me but it it's not.

But my children wanted to see it, so we rented it, and wow, was I taken back. This is actually a very funny movie. Starring mostly lesser name actors for the human characters, the guinea pigs are voiced by stars such as Steve Buscemi and Nicholas Cage. The story is quite a simple; two scientists develop technology that gives human intellect and speech to small animals such as flies, guinea pigs and moles. These upgraded animals are then used to fight international crime and terrorism. This movie is part action, part comedy, and part adventure. The special effects are kept low-key but they are effective, especially the movement of the animals. The dialog is quite engaging, with each of the animals having their own unique personalities, attitudes and slang. Best of all is the storyline, which keeps you guessing to the very last minutes of the movie. Overall, quite worth the watch.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

Its their favorite toy. Its being used indoors. Very easy to assemble and disassemble, roomy and sturdy - my 22 month old has pushed and pulled at it, run into it, toppled it over, bulldozed her way into it and its holding up very well. Provides hours of pretend play opportunities. It allows them to feel like they are on an 'adventure' - they take their toys into it, their pillow and blankets, their snacks...roll down the window, zip the flap and they are in their own world (even though the tent is in full view of the grownups in the room). The mesh panels on the top make it easy for a grown up to check in on them without 'intruding' in their space. One of the best toys I've purchased for them.",

Capon is particularly adept at unveiling our shallow \"theologies of the Cross.\" This stuff is Calvin with a flair. Those who preach will appreciate his lively Buechner-esque style. I enjoy the way he anticipates various protests from his reader, then answers him/her with earthy honesty. For example, to those who insist on topical over lectionary preaching, he quips: \"Like topical anesthetics (topical sermons) don't go deep!\" The price of the book is worth the first part. The second part, on the mechanics of the sermon, is not as fun to read, but will be helpful for those just starting out in the pulpit. --Phil Jones, pastor Ayden Christian Church, Ayden NC.",

Some people mentioned the challenge of the install. Now I'm the strongest man at 44yrs but I'm fit if you need a hand it would make it easier. I found it very easy to do all by myself. It only took me 5 minutes to install. I used the bed of the truck(use something between bed and tailgate) on a 90 degree angle to line up the hole on the tailgate. The trickiest part is when you have to rotate the tailgate to a 10 o'clock 4 o'clock angle to get the rod to the right placement. The instruction short and simple. Follow Them! It only takes 2 fingers to close. On the lowering it only slows it a little but feels very light if you lower by hand.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

BIG MISTAKE! We followed the preparation directions explicitly and were very disappointed with the results. As soon as we plugged in the motor, we had to quickly insert earplugs to protect our hearing. The motor screeched off and on for over 42 minutes and the ice cream never hardened. We noticed the sticker on the motor said \"Made in China\" so that explains the problem. After digging a little further, I found out that Rival owns White Mountain. I have been making soft home-made ice cream for years with my Rival Ice Cream Freezer, so I'm returning the White Mountain a.s.a.p. for a full refund. What a disappointment! Don't buy a White Mountain. Save your money! If you have an old White Mountain that was made in the USA, count yourself lucky!

I was very suprised when I first listened to this album. To find Sufist teachings hidden in a funk/house album, was really a new thing. Mercan Dede, did not only use the background and rythm from Sufi Music but also the teachings. Especially the song \"Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi\", named after the famous Persian Sufi, is a 5 Star song of the album. Without using words Mercan Dede manages to show that life is a circle. \"Walking on the Red Sea\", is a good example of how Mercan Dede is succesful in mixing Sufi Rythm with other backgrounds. In my opinion these points helps this album become universal and reach audiences far beyond any other etnic funk album would do.\nAnswer:",

It all sounded like the same song over and over again, and as the person I was watching the movie with stated, it was filled with Bono's masturbatory musical moments (ie. unnecessary musical vignettes during a scene, lyrics that were dour, dull and pretty much unrelated to the action, etc.)I am a HUGE Mel Gibson fan, and love Jimmy Smits, but both of their performances were mediocre, at best. It surely had more to do with an uninspired (and uninspiring) script than any shortcomings of theirs.I won't give away the big mystery behind Mel's neck brace, but it was the most ridiculous plot twist (if you could call it that?!?)

And there is nothing wrong with Sandy having one line. She's not that important of a character, anyway. Do you see her often in the show? I do agree that Squidward needed a bit more screentime. I think he's quite funny. I love the TV show, and I loved this movie when I viewed it in the theater on opening night. The ending is most definately the funniest part of this little flick.And for those who think he is homosexual...You've got to be kidding me. He's supposed to be childlike, not homosexual. And what's so bad about homosexuality anyway? I have friends who are homosexuals. So, all of you overly obsessive Christians can go shove it. I'm a Christian, too but it's not right to bash homosexuality or the people that practice it.

I can see the nuts falling out, but the u-bolts? Other information on the box that should be with the product description: Vehicle MUST have at least 2 3/16\" wide and 4 7/8\" long spring plate (which seems to be the size of the blocks).

Dick's wonderful Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the novel upon which it was based, more or less totally ruined it for me. Virtually all of the rich layers of reality, religious allegory, and *many* significant plot points were completely absent from the film. One of the main characters, Jack Isidore, was entirely eliminated, and the shared messianic experiences and electronic animals were also gone. Also, Rick was married in the novel.If you're going to see this, you should definitely read the novel as well--it's a much richer experience.Neat-o special effects, though.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

The man died sometime after 10am, but the exact time of death is a mystery. It becomes a pressing mystery when it becomes clear that the time of death determines who will inherit a large fortune. The convoluted family argument and complex relationships make Wimsey's efforts more difficult. Halfway through the book the culprit seems to be apprehended, but Wimsey isn't so sure. I liked the model of a solution partway through the book that had to be unraveled.This book had little engagement with Wimsey's life outside of the mystery. It is a book dependent upon Wimsey entering an existing situation. The details are numerous, and we get an interesting look at a London gentlemen's club in the 1920s. Overall, an entertaining classic mystery.\nAnswer:",

For instance, Rochester, the black man, is the only one stupid enough to fall down the secret passage chair not once but twice, and the dim-witted society lady knocks on the door herself and says, \"Come in.\" We could only wish that intelligence would \"come in\"to this movie.\nIs this product review negative?",

The menagerie of animals, the Red Bull, and the old guy in the castle (sorry, I forget his name!) was enough to creep any kid under the age of 10 out. I definitely recommend this movie to kids 11+ because it sends the imagination soaring and takes you back to fantasy land. Plus, for it's time, the cartoon effects are very good.

I'm not one to take things too seriously to see the humor in everyday life; in fact I consider doing so to be humans' best coping mechanism. But this movie falls prey like so many others these days to the urge to drastically overstate its thesis lest the slow-witted fail to grasp it. You can't start with miserable and strive for sardonic irony. You can start with sardonic irony and strive for humor, sure, but going waaaay too dark from the start makes it impossible to be lighthearted to the grown-ups out there. Think the difference between Little Miss Sunshine and One Flew Over Cuckoos Nest: this is trying for the former and nailing the latter but without the social commentary.

Only later did I realize where the movie missed its mark; there was very little social commentary, an error makes the movie merely fluff instead of one of the best comedies of all time.Let's face it. Every single one of Mary's suitors is a stalker. At a time where sound bites are confused with political leadership and \"Titanic\" confused with entertainment, this film could have made a powerful point on the confusion between love and obsession without sacrificing its hilarious, tasteless humor.It's so rare, however, for a movie to consciously cross every bound of good taste and do so with a good heart and a broad audience appeal. You *will* laugh out loud, but you'll also wish the movie had had the courage to go that last step.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

My intrigue led me to purchase the book, which was an eye-opening experience. After reading it, I'm convinced I had been sucked in by my former financial advisors to purchase products which I didn't need and cost too much. Instead of jumping in with both feet and totally revamping my investment habits, I've followed Steve's advice and gone into it slowly. I'm migrating from mutual funds (and annuities) to individual, high quality equities. My next step is to start purchasing bonds, as soon as the rates recover.

It's a far cry from unique, set in a fantasy world like most others. While I was interested enough to find out what happens next, the plot was never really remarkable. Plot \"twists\" are encountered with a slight nod. The psychology behind the characters is loose and some developments are sketchy (a woman on one side of the world conveniently appears on the other side of the world, and got there before Eragon, though it took him a week). And the ending...wait...that's the ending? I am reminded of my early efforts with managing long plots. I had the beginnings down, but the ends rushed to an impatient resolution. I think this book is 90% hype, and I'm not impressed that he started writing when he was 15. So did I, and while my 500-pages of amateur effort commit many of the same sins as Paolini's published work, it's a better read, and unpublished (thank god!).\nAnswer:",

If you think pyramid schemes are funny or if you are a big fan of the Shank then you will love this movie. I admit it is low budget and straight to DVD but it is funnier than a lot of big budget blockbuster comedies that I have seen. Phiffer does a great job in his role as the big business entrepenuer. The plot is original and there are some really hilarious scenes. If you think about it, there are some parts of the film that really ring true. I grew up only seeing the TV edited version of the Shank and didn't know about the rape scene(Which is an important part of the plot) until much later when I saw the unedited version.\nAnswer:",

This remake throws some heavy morsels of CGI down your throat and will give you indigestion.Same basic story, some people volunteer to stay in an extravagant mansion. This time they aren't told about the house's dark past. They believe they are part of a study on insomnia. The truth is they are part of a controlled experiment on group fear.Now I thought this was a nice alteration to the story. But unfortunately it starts to get extremely ridiculous. Nothing subtle here, there are plenty of cheap scares--like ghostly images or moving statues. As it turns out this house is basically a holding cell for dead children's souls. The evil landlord's spirit keeps watch over them in this purgatory. Great, a perverted pedaphile ghost.This turns into more of a goofy adventure flick. No spooky atmosphere or mystery. No suspense. No reason to bother.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

        "Title: Good idea but poor engineering\nReview: I found this item to be worth the money to digitize my valued slides, after much fooling around to make it work, but of \"dollar store\" value when it comes to quality engineering and practicality. To focus on each slide you must be able to turn the camera focus ring, which then turns the slide holder off its horizontal plane. If the holder pivot point had slightly looser toleraces it would be easy to adjust that part with two fingers. Instead it takes both hands to avoid torquing the camera lens. I finally left the \"contraption\" one thread loose on the lens barrel, placed the slide holder end on a solid horizontal surface and was able to focus that way with probably 80% focusing success. If you want to fool with it you can get satisfactory results, just don't be in a hurry. I think the price for this copier as is should be more in the $9.95 range. If the person who developed this is reading, you have a good idea but it needs refinement!\nIs the review positive or negative?",

        "Title: A great Book!\nReview: The reason that this book is so great is that it can be read on two levels. The first, more obvious level is that it tells a story about what the future could possibly be like. The concept of a colorless, symetrically boring society is very original and provokes thought in the reader. The main plotline tells the story of a young boy's struggle when he begins to realize all the things that once existed in the world, such as color, animals and emotions. The fact that only he knows the real truth creates a deep sense of loneliness in the 12 year old. Moreover, this book can be read on a deeper level. The themes of conformity and morality hold a strong presence in this novel. In short, \"The Giver\" is an excellent story that can be enjoyed by all readers over 11 years old.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

My son is 10 months old and as long as your child is playing with the tunnel under supervision there is no reason that they cannot use this product sooner. Love the fact that it slinks up so compact when not in use and for travel. My son will play peek-a-boo and then crawl through the tunnel to come get me on the other side. He can also sit up inside the tunnel without a problem being that he is still younger. He did get mad however, at the fact that he tried to stand up inside the tunnel and could not, guess we will have to get him the tent that attches. Which brings on another good point, this product can be fit to many other products for increased fun (tent, another tunnel, etc.). Leads itself to many options. Would recommend.",

As newborns have no visible veins, the infant was injected in the forehead.Now if you think that this is appropriate subject matter for your 7th and 8th grade children, buy it.

I disagree with the reviewer who thought the Papa Papa side was not as good.What I especially love is the image and words that refer to breastfeeding. The lovely words (Give me warmth and give me milk) are accompanied by a beautiful illustration of a cheetah nursing.

The whole mood of her novel is electrifying and startling. The sensation is similar to arriving at the very edge of a mountain precipice, gazing down, and feeling the enormity of life rush over you. This sense of vertigo is one of Shelley's gifts. She has the wild writer's mind and she can deliver the chills. One could argue her shocking sense of life was very similar to the later wildly popular french philosopher Jean Paul Sarte, and the theme of his sudden realization of the horror of existence. Shelley's gothic novel written in the age of romance has elements of both styles. But, it's her wild mind that makes this novel eerie, extraordinary and amazing.

The spirit and sound of the film are period perfect. Swayze and Grey are a perfect film couple; they are sympathetic characters with great chemistry. The standard Hollywood conventions and devices mount up by the end, spoiling the \"willing suspension of disbelief\". For a while, though, you can forget this is a Hollywood movie. Regardless of its increasing implausibility as the film barrels along, I still felt tears well up at the finale.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

        "Title: And I thought my life was hard - shhheeeessshhhhh !!!\nReview: Hands down the best book I've read in over a year. I bought this book because I was void of hope. I felt my painful experiences far exceeded anybody else's. Who could relate with me? I'll tell you who. This man here: Viktor Frankl. He invented logotherapy which is far more effective than psychotherapy. It deals with the meaning in our Lives rather than the problems with our brains. I thought that I had lived a hard one until I read this book. A concentration camp during the holocaust was no joke, the epitomy of suffering. Yet, there is meaning behind everything in Life, even times of great distress. This book awoke me from my slumber!! If you think that your Life is hopeless and not worth living .... please READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!\nIs this product review negative?",

        "Title: Didn't care for it...\nReview: Demon's daughter is the story of Adrian Phillips, a police officer in an alternate London where demon-like creatures called Yama run the show and humanity are pretty much in league with the Yamish or alternatively their lunch.Frankly, while I found the story descriptive, this novel didn't really rock my boat. Why? The authors attempts at erotic tension fell flat for me. The two main characters are in such a state of arousal when they first meet I'm surprised they can walk. This state seems to continue throughout the book to a ludicrous degree. What the author considered 'exciting' and 'erotic' frankly just made me groan.Also, I was bored with the whole orphan subplot. Not a big fan of kiddies in my romance novels. Yes we get it. The heroine is a saint for looking after two orphans. Can we get back to the main story now?Sorry, I hate to go against the tide which is obviously a very popular novel, but Demon's Daughter bored me and I found the 'erotic tension' ludicrous. 1 Star.\nIs this product review negative?",

        "Title: Weight of speaker is a factor\nReview: There are several reviews that reference the fact that heavier speakers sag with this mount. I found the same thing to be true. One mount i purchased held the speaker nicely while the other would not hold the same position even after numerous attempts. I did find an easy solution. I used small piece of wire (i.e.. a coat hanger) cut to the proper length to use as support at the bottom of the speaker to keep it from sagging. It is really a shame that i had to find a solution to this problem in that these mounts are pricey, but it works perfectly just the same. It was a lot easier than shipping them back to the retailer and finding another option.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

I bought this hoping that I would be surprised and enjoy the movie. I like all the star trek movies except for this one. It puts me to sleep when i watch it. It is bogged down with all the special effects they experimented with on this movie. The shots in outer space are just too long and should have been cut down. It seems like there are moments in the movie that last near 10 minutes with no dialog, but just the crew looking and reacting to what they see in space. VERY BORING. The dvd is nicely done with plenty of extras including deleted scenes, some of which would have made the movie more fun if included.

FIND A BETTER WAY TO EXPRESS YOURSELF OTHER THAN WITH EXPLETIVES! Good grief, her use of the four letter word is exhausting. That smacks of dullness of mind. She had a great premise and ruined it by her continual use of profanity and whining. A very disappointing book. This is the first time I have ever chosen a movie over the book.

The lyrics are smart, and the production isn't lacking either. Kweller flexes his songwriting muscle throughout this LP, but the brightest of the highlights are 'Commerce, TX' 'Wasted and Ready' and 'Falling'. The disc is driven by emotion without being whiny, which is very crucial as far as replay value is concerned. It's very similar to Ben Folds' newer stuff without being a carbon copy of it. In short, it's simply an excellent CD.",

If polls are to be believed, the majority of Americans say they are concerned about the environment, but few of us manage to live up to our convictions. Jensen's book is so compelling that has the power to push readers from complacency to activism in a quiet, but forceful manner.What is truly unique about this book is the manner in which Jensen discusses his own journey to personal activism. He spent years numbing himself to the sexual abuse inflicted upon him by father. He sees the same processes at work in our destructive relationship to the environment. Learning to treat each othe with greater respect and learning to appreciate the natural living environment, he argues, are irrevocably linked.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

I'm an experienced web developer and already know how style sheets work and how to use them - I just wanted a book where I could quickly look up specific syntax, etc.This book definitely doesn't work for that - the index is sorely lacking and the information isn't well-organized at all. So, since a lot of the other reviewers wrote that this book isn't for beginners (I agree) and, since I'm an experienced developer and it's not working for me, I'm not sure who would find this book useful. Especially when there are so many other CSS books to choose from.....Normally O'Reilly books are really good, so I'm a little bit surprised that they published this book without having an editor clean it up and organize it.

Think \"Newhart\" on steroids. Great, great caustic, physical/slapstick humor that's made even funnier by a fantastic cast.

The main problem is that it presents the love story as if it were true, and there's no real confirmation that such was the case. All the research I did after watching the movie (trying to see whether it was based on a real story) shows that the \"relationship\" might have simply been a little flirtation, and not, as it is presented here, true love. Besides, James McAvoy is utterly compelling, but Anne Hathaway has zero appeal, and I found her to be an uninteresting and very plain Jane.",

And like any good movie, it gives the viewer a sense of time, place and character while telling a compelling story. This movie does so brilliantly. The acting is impressive - and why not? Jeffrey Wright and Adrien Brody are respected actors. Beyonce steps outside her comfort zone and gives a performance one would only expect from an experienced actor. The music is performed with love and respect. The sets, wardrobe, cars - everything gives you a real sense of the southside of Chicago in the 1950s, and of the people who not only sang but lived the blues. Don't quibble over details; go read a book on the history of Chess Records if that's what you're looking for. But if you are looking for a compelling story with a strong script that is well acted and directed, and so much more deserving of the little attention it received when it was in release, then you must see this film. If you love the blues, YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM.\nAnswer:",

The pacing of this movie, with the exception of several fight scenes, is leaden. Regardless of what is happening, everyone moves at the same slow pace. Even when the bad guys are hot on the trail, the good guys just sleepwalk through another scene. This might be because this 2.5 hr movie only has 1.25 hrs of plot. Even with all this extra time, nobody thought to add a little dialogue to clean up all the loose ends. For example, after the early battle, he says he wants to go home to his farm & family. If he had said his farm was in Spain (easily done)then it would make sense that he was called the Spaniard when he was a slave. This is just one of many examples of this films many failures.Save your money or buy some porn. The dialogue is almost as good and the acting is better.",

Bad performance.\nReview: I tried this out because my old Bluetrek that I loved died. Actually, I killed it when I forgot where it was and sat on it. I was impressed with the advertised battery life, and took the plunge. Shouldn't have. While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet, I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body, the connection gets fickle. You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight. Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology, doesn't it? And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it. So if yo get this, be prepared to anger your party on the other line. On the plus side, the sound is nice and loud in th speaker. That's about it. Try something else, like a bluetrek or motorola or something. I am trying the Motorola next. This thing is trash.",

This is a very helpful resource to me because it gives an overview of what kids should be learning at each stage along the way. (Fortunately, my kids' school seems to be doing pretty well in most areas.) This resource helps me plan what areas to supplement with home reading and projects.",

Weak compared to his other works.\nReview: While Joyce's Ulysses demonstrates his monstrous success with literary experimentation styles, FW does not. I find it poor by his standards. In academics (and among pseudo-intellectuals) the book is quite fashionable, and understably so - the style is unique. Its almost comical to listen to my fellow Joyce fans rave about it. But whenever I corner them, and beg them to dissect the work for me, the responses are as incoherent as the book itself. Perhaps it inspires creative thinking/translation from its readers, but nothing of the sort on my part, despite my repeated efforts to sincerely read it.I've read far worse, that's for sure, but someone thinking of dabbling with Joyce for the first time should seriously consider selecting one of his more substantial earlier works, or the frustration with FW may alienate them forever from an otherwise brilliant and often very powerful author.",

I got aquanted with Japanese saws as a woodworker cutting dovetails, and those are very thin and expensive, very fine teeth, but best for very detailed work, and you don't want to use it except for that.These saws are an affordable alternative to push saws, which unless you spend a lot of money, or know how to set the teeth and file them, have never been all that useful to me.

The constant use of hymns, prayers and poetry was boring and perhaps a way to stretch the book to fufill a publishing contract. It would have been far better to address readers' questions about Dooley, Kenny and Lace in the previous book and ended the series at that point. This was a hugely disappointing book as the characters loved in Mitford made essentially brief and shallow appearances. Jan Karon herself appears to have been bored with Mitford and this lazy effort cheats the loyal reader of a satisfying end to the series. I will not be reading the Father Tim novels and believe Jan Karon's reputation is lessened by her milking the series this way. Don't waste your money.

        "Here is a review left by a customer on a product. Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied?\nTitle: a fairytale for slow children\nReview: After reading Tony Earley's story collection Here We Are in Paradise, I expected a clever and cleverly written first novel, not terribly deep but entertaining. Instead, Jim the Boy is a bland and episodic and schmaltzy tale that never rings true. The book tries so hard to be heartwarming and simple that only a child could take it at face value, and a child that knows nothing about life--and certainly not life in the depression South. A startlingly unambitious and self-congratulatory book, filled with nostalgia for a place that never existed. I can't think of a supposedly literary book with less in it. The prose is supposed to be understated and poignant, but there's nothing underneath it. Jim the Boy is the literary equivalent of The Emperor's New Clothes, and makes the reader ask: what happened to the guy that wrote \"Charlotte\"?",

Vonnegut usually has some phrase or idea he repeats extensively in his novels; you may remember \"ting-a-ling\" or \"So it goes\"; well, in this novel, which is excessively badly pornographic in passing, Vonnegut feels the need to tell you the size of every male character's member upon introduction; It really doesn't serve any central purpose to the story.Two of the key characters, Rabo and Kilgore, are served up much more fascinatingly and entertainingly in other books. He also includes a TON of drawings, which are only necessary maybe one fifth of the time. I guess I believe he has a problem with moderation!\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

The chauvinistic/psychopathic societies we live in, are designed to strangle this feminine aspect as to deprive women from their instinctual nature to resist, to fight back and to overcome. Women are to be kept subservient. But despite the predators from outside, a woman's worst predator is that of her inner landscape, born of the suppression from outside.And that is why Estes book is of vital importance to each and every woman on this planet: through excellent writing, the use of stories and a profound insight into the feminine realm, she offers us the means and ways to understand the inner and outer restrictions on our instinctual selfs, and a map out to freedom, the key to unlock the chains that hold the Wild Woman captive.A must read!\nAnswer:",

Verne has managed to writing an intriguing, invigorating and adventure-filled adventure that also delves into questions morality and religion. Verne's love of science and technology is a leading theme through out the book and one gets a lesson in the marine-life as it was known during his lifetime. The illustrations by the Dillon's are certainly a work of art to bestow and admire. The afterword by Peter Glassman is very well-written and informative.

What's written in history is mostly made up anyway. This movie probably came closer than we think. Who cares? Russell Crowe is spectacular in his understated performance as Maximus (he deserved the Oscar he got) and Mr. Phoenix was also superb. As a matter of fact, the entire cast was well suited, including Derek Jacoby, Richard Harris and the always wonderful and (much missed) Oliver Reed.And the end - well - it was moving and so well done.

        "Based on this review, would the user recommend this product?\n===\nReview: Rohinton Mistry posits that even in a society in which the government is corrupt and the poverty level in inhumane, small decencies still exist - decencies that promote humor, compassion, and a bittersweet degree of compassion and tenderness.Family Matters is set in Bombay in the 90s. The deterioration of the city is paralleled by the physical condition of an elderly professor with Parkinson's disease. Set against the horrors of overcrowding, family secrets, tensions between the various family members, Mistry fully explores the tightrope walk that constitutes just getting through life for most people in the world - yet he does so with humor, tenderness, and a haunting feeling of love.\nAnswer:",

I used this book one semester in an undergraduate applied linguistics course and received very negative feedback from the students. In spite of the fact that the back cover claims that the book is for those with no previous knowledge of L2 acquisition research, it was definitely not accessible to my students. It lacks a clearly organized approach in explaining the history of the discipline, existing L2 acquisition theory, what motivates researchers to conduct the studies that they do, and the terminology of the discipline. I have since found that a better choice for real begginers in this area is \"Principles of Language Learning and TEaching\" by H.D. Brown (1994). Its scope includes more than L2 acquisition theory, as the title suggests, but it provides the basic understanding necessary to then begin to talk about current research.\nAnswer:",

I purchased because I wanted that bottle that was pictured that would stand upright and not leak all over. Instead, I got a tiny tube with significantly less threadlocker than was anticipated. Toolfetch doesn't charge much for the tube, but quite a bit (almost 3x) for shipping, so you won't return it if, like me, you weren't paying close enough attention and relied on their picture to be an accurate representation of what they were shipping. Based on the fact you can't blow the picture up enough to read the printing on the bottle to confirm its volume, the marked-up then marked-down pricing and the disproportionate shipping charge, I can only conclude that this was intentional on the part of toolfetch.\nAnswer:",

I give this a four mainly because I wish there were a few more explanations in the making of the flowers. There are lots of beautiful pictures of the completed designs. There are some photos of the in-process project. The photo of the in-process are kind of the same through-out the book though. The individual parts of each project that are different are not specifically photographed and included in the photos. I am not an expert at gumpaste making or design, but I am not new to it either. Sometimes its a bit hard to understand. Thats why I think the other photos would help. All in all a beautiful design book. I have page-marked some designs and just plan on making them however I can lol.\nIs this product review negative?",

This is a timeless recording by Return To Forever.The acoustic and electric guitar work of Al Di Meola (only 21 years of age when this classic was released) sends chills up my spine each time I hear it. Chick Corea, the consummate musician, is once again virtuous on the synthesizer, organ, and piano. The drums of Lenny White are tight, and the bass work of Stanley Clarke is immensely complex, yet very sonorous.This disc is a gem. To give it any less than a five-star rating is criminal. It's good to know music like this exists at an affordable price, especially in our world of hackneyed, superficial pop-music. With each listen of \"No Mystery,\" a new level of music appreciation is procured.Brilliant stuff.\nAnswer:",

At 1:00 that morning, I found myself turning the last page, awestruck, wishing I had the energy to read it just one more time before I slept.

I've always been into cheesy pop stuff (I probably have the biggest Debbie Gibson collection of anyone (well, anyone who would admit it)). So getting into Mandy Moore wasn't too big a stretch. I actually saw the 2 of them together at a radio station promo back in 99. They both sang to pre-recorded tracks, but it was still cool.Anyway - this album is way cool. You'd have to be a freak to be disappointed. All great songs, all great arrangements. It isn't often you get to hear vibes in pop music today.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

The only reason I hated it was because the man I wanted the heroine to end up with was killed off halfway through the book. I couldn't believe this character that I had grown to love died and that the heroine ended up with a character that I really didn't care for at all. It was shocking.The book itself was, as always, well-written. However, if you want to read this book, I suggest reading the beginning, because it certainly was the best part.",

This topic is absolutely inappropriate. Secondly, the author is very proud of her nonconclusive ending.

The story line is what drags this movie down. Beyond the slew of predictable lines and scenarios, I found the message of the film a bit shallow. \"Love conquers all...including schizophrenia.\" It's just not life-like. Some of the imagery and allusions are heavy-handed at times. I wanted to scream, \"OK, I get it.\" Not a terrible film, but not that great either.

When he decided not to make it because of the limited access he would have to the teams I was disappointed.

Even funnier were the inconsistencies regarding the cars. You need a special starter to get the hydraulics started and then you can start the engine. However, in \"Chicago\" both Kip & Sly were able to start the cars without them when they went racing through the streets.

Run for ear plugs as she and Mr. Dalton mutilate \"Love will keep us together\" (not the best song to begin with but it deserves better than this). Recoil in horror as the reanimated corpse of Mae West spouts sexual innuendos that were stale 60 years before this film was made!Of course, even without Ms. West dottering around the set this movie would be unwatchable. The screenplay is dreck and it was seemingly directed by Helen Keller.I watched this movie on a dare, and I'm convinced that God has knocked some time of my upcoming sentence in Purgatory because of it.

I had an Epson 440 printer that wasn't very good with printing photos and it always put streaks of black ink on everything. I went to Staples to buy a new printer after my Epson died on me and was planning on buying the Canon S600 but they were out of stock so I picked up the HP deskjet 940c and was a bit worried after reading the reviews here that I might not have a good printer but so far this printer is great! The first thing I printed on it was an old photo of my grandfather that came out better than the original. I then printed some wallet size pictures of my son from his school picture they also came out wonderful. I am very pleased with this printer. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it seems to be a bit slow in printing but as long as the printing comes out well that doesn't bother me too much.

Even though the test is supposedly different, and the science supposedly easier, this book is almost identical to the MSAT test prep book. Which makes you wonder why they couldn't fix the numreous typos between publications...Haven't taken the CSET yet, but I know I wouldn't feel prepared relying on this book alone.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Oasis is a bit cheesy, a bit too commercial, too clinical, can't lay my finger on it, it seems to be missing a 'soul'. Maybe in the 70's this sounded great, but nowadays it just very very dated.Granted, a few nice songs such as 'Rising Sun' and 'Aqua' (for two songs it gets two stars), but mainly elevator music, best soon forgotten.Btw, the beginning of 'Rising Sun' and 'Floating' from the album Moondawn by Klaus Schulze are eerily similar. What's that about mr. Kitaro?Well, maybe Schulze got it from Kitaro. He produced the Japanese 'Far East Family Band', of which kitaro was a member, and Moondawn was inspired by the Far East Family Band.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

The doll was quite expensive, the only one with the feature I was looking for in that particular toy store. It comes without any instructions, or maybe they were missing from the box, but I really doubt that. When you give the doll water it instantly starts peeing, better when it is laying down than when it sits on the potty. No matter how you turn it and how you close or open the valve, IT LEAKS. I could not see any tears no matter how I turned it. Overall, big waste of money, I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST IT.

I thought the market for traditional metal and Power metal died by the end of 1991 because it refused to expand into new territory. It seems that in the past seven years though, legions of new Power metal/traditional Metal bands have managed to resurrect two Metal subgenres that died for a reason. This music makes me want to bury my head in the sand (the same way an ostrich does).P.S.: Come on metalheads, stop being such tools and support Death metal. I recommend starting out with Death's \"Symbolic\", At the gates' \"Terminal spirit disease\", Dark tranquility's \"Skydancer/Of chaos and eternal night\", Amon amarth's \"Versus the world\", and In flames' \"The jester race\".

His portrait of a populist demagogue is just too much over the top towards a caricature of Chaplin's great dictator.Second, the script writer. It can not be that easy to foul up an essentially good story so badly. There is no narrative drive.Third, this must be Jude Law's worst film ever. He is not an obvious miscast, one can initially believe his character, the young man from an elite background and his mutual attraction with the vulgar politician. But in the course of the plot, the motivation of his character loses ground, and Law is at a loss for adequate facial expressions. He makes a mess of it.Hopkins and Winslet are doing fine, but why are 3 English actors needed for a Louisiana story?\nAnswer:",

RCA or whoever told Clay to sing all the same type of songs was way off base. When done live, one song only, then Clay does come through as we know him. Where is \"Unchained Melody\"?

I can't recommend it highly enough, but I must also suggest that smart shoppers may want to check it out on Amazon.co.uk, where as of this writing, it is listed at 6.68 pounds, or $11. Even with Royal Airmail shipping, the cost is in the neighborhood of $16--way cheaper than it's ever been offered on the U.S. Amazon. While you're there, you can shop around for other UK-centric music you might be interested in, like the deluxe reissues of ABC's Lexicon of Love, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions' Rattlesnakes and Manic Street Preachers' Everything Must Go, to name but a few. Plus the \"new\" Prefab album, Let's Change the World With Music, is also available at a better price. The more you get, the more you amortize the shipping cost. Regardless, it's worth it just to get the two-disc Steve McQueen all by its lonesome.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

        "Title: A Genuine Achievement\nReview: I don't usually review movies (...) but felt I had to take a moment to praise Rules of Attraction for really capturing the lives of children of privilege. Somehow, utilizing mostly satire, this film captures the pain and longing beneath the trappings of wealth. A straightforward, empathetic approach wouldn't have worked -- these aren't the most charming people. By distancing us from their pain, Avary actually allows us to see it more clearly.The film collapses under its own weight at the end. Anyway it's less a real narrative than a freeform look at sexual confusion and mores at the end of a wretched century. Beautiful and brave performances from start to finish, especially Ian Somerholder's as a pampered, narcissistic gay student with a very wrong crush.\nIs this product review negative?",

Turns out that glassjaw is not that good at all, their songs have no direction and dont make sense. I'm all for the screaming and everything but it doesnt work with them, the guitars have to be the worst thing about it, their all over the place, the singer is great and is the only thing that keeps it respectable. Some of the songs alright though, i really liked ape dos mil, and there were a few other decent ones like must have run all day, two tabs of mescaline, cavalcade and convectuoso.

Neat purple wooden mice and two fun dice with a sleeping cats, dinner bowls, and left pointing arrows. You basically take turns rolling these dice and either: doing nothing, giving a mouse to the player on your left, taking a mouse from the dinner bowl, or putting a mouse in the dinner bowl.That's all there is to it. There is no strategy whatsoever and no where to grow once you master the mechanics of rolling dice and moving mice. My four-year-old has wanted to play it once since we bought it, but to me it's a very tiring ordeal. I envy the cats sleeping on the dice.This game is good for teaching very young children how to take turns and roll dice, but not a whole lot more.

As a major complaint about sequels is they simply repeat the original with subtle changes it only makes sense for the sequel to Airplane to address this directly by almost copying some jokes almost verbatim. I sometimes enjoy the sequel more because the jokes never stop, in Airplane!, the last 20 minutes were slow with the jokes as the plot was being wrapped up.I am giving the DVD only 1 star because it only has the movie, no special features not even an audio commentary. I would have loved to have the theatrical version and a version with every scene available. The movie is only 86 minutes; there would have been room on the DVD.The movie itself gets 5 stars\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

The writing is wonderful, and the protagonist someone we can all identify with. My only complaint is the somewhat abrupt and unsatisfying ending. This is a rather famous book, and should probably be in any serious reader's collection. I recommend for age 12 and up. Older teens probably won't appreciate it, but once past the \"I don't read kids books\" phase it can be read again for more depth and analysis. For some reason, Giver gets banned a lot, which I can't fathom. The only thing I can think is an issue; there is one particularly distressing scene. Parents should probably read this first so that can both decide what age is appropriate for the child to read it and to be prepared to discuss some major issues.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

The acting is horrible and the freddy deaths are like something out of a looney toons cartoon. Freddy delivers way too many one liners and they aren't even clever or funny. The idea of Freddy being able to travel to other Elm Streets and kill new victims was a great idea, but unfortunately the idea turns into $#!% on screen. The best part, seriously, is the end. Not the movie part but the credits. This is due to the fact that horrible movie is over and you get to see the deaths from other NOES movies. Catch it late at night on tv if you still desire to see it, otherwise avoid at all costs\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

If I had to pick my favorite Scopions recording it would be Lonesome Crow. Featuring then 15-year old Michael Schenker on guitar, \"Lonesome Crow\" is a hypnotic journey into a richly- textured soundscape. The mystical songs are washed in a myriad of swirling, ambient tonal colors and shades. The bass and drums work expertly to blend jazz and rock influences to provide a vehicle for Schenker's enigmatic , classically-influenced solos. If you are a Scorpions fan and you like the older ones like \"In Trance\" , get this one. You'll be happy you did.\nAnswer:",

The positive reviews here are from first impressions. However, I have had this clipper close to a year but with probably less then 5 hours use. When I first received it, it felt very light and cheaply made. I gave it the benifit of the doubt and hoped for the best. Last time it worked, the motor slowed down to almost a halt. I keep it cleaned and oiled. The motor is just too cheap. Im not sure what the company Wahl was thinking when they made this product. They should really consider discontinueing this model because it is hurting their image. I would not even attempt to use my warranty because it's not defected parts. It's a total LEMON.

I'm talking about the scenes where Naomi Watts and King Kong are alone together - both on Skull Island and in Central Park - which just make up for the rest of the movie. Sure Adrian Brody and Jack Black are great (especially towards the end when Jack Black is in full Orson Welles mode) but this is Naomi Watts' movie.Also props for giving Andy Serkis a human character as well as the Kong movement. Now I wish that Peter Jackson would cast Serkis as MacBeth with Kate Winslet as Lady MacBeth and Vigo Mortensson as MacDuff - well one can hope.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

This is a plug adapter and should be a very somple device. Using the plug that fits in Italy's two-prong 220-240 V recepticle, the 110-120 V 60Hz/220-240 V (50Hz) cell phone charger worked maybe five minutes. I checked it to be sure that the adapter plug end was properly positioned and properly locked in place - which it was. I tried a couple of other low voltage devices set to operate in duel voltage and it would not work. I messed with it for quite a while and could never get it to make an electrical connection - we stayed in several locations and it would not work - period. It was never overloaded (cell phone charger) - it's a huge waste of money and this thing was very expensive for it's intended purpose. If you need foreign adapters, buy a kit with the individual plug adapters - you will save money and frustration.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

The drummer is bad *ss! And the lead singer is the craziest guy but very sociable at the same time.If you want my true opinion the best release they ever had was an EP. The \"UNABOMBER\" EP that came out in 1998 on Decomposed Records.

The third one started short cupping after having it a short period of time so they ran me through all that cleaning bit, descaling and running three cups water through it and it continued to do the same. Called them back and got a different person and they had me do the same stuff again. Finally they sent me a fourth one and now it take 3-5 minutes of listening to a quiet motor running and it will say brewing before anything happens. A great big expensive piece of junk. Do not buy.

It is one of the most sensual and sexy, thrilling and well paced movies I have ever seen.

Lillo Brancato (age 17) and Francis Capra (age 9), both do an excellent job playing the boy Calogero, whom we witness grow up throughout this movie. De Niro and Chazz Palminteri also do a very respectable job portraying C.'s father and the gangster, Sonny. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action, a little bit of romance, and lots of adventure. This movie is very realistic and that is what makes it so great!\nIs this product review negative?",

The drier, police procedural stuff is getting less and less. Here, Fat Ollie, is played for laughs while Steve Carella does the real investigating. I really like the continuity of the 87th and the books are very entertaining. It's hard to believe there are about 50 of them, I'll have to find #1 and see how how the late 1950s were portrayed.

If you enjoy historical fiction, and have any interest at all in getting behind the scenes of the pomp and venality of the British court in pre-Elizabethan England, then this is a must. The book rounds out some curious aspects of Henry's six marriages not found in most history texts. It gives a sense of the gossip that was the currency of the court, among the men and women - which she of course is imagining - but which provides context and a fuller view of the mores of the time. Also, I had no idea that another Boleyn daughter existed beyond Anne, and never grasped the position her family (the Howards) held at court, or the effects their rivalry with the Seymours had on their choices. Adjunct reading: Lady Antonia Fraser's \"The Wives of Henry VIII.\" Also check web for more info and pictures of these women.\nAnswer:",

Perhaps the film had so powerful an effect that it caused in me a condition, similar to one of the protagonist (at least in relation to the contents of the movie itself). Or may be it was a lack of emotional depth, unrelated shallow characters, and complete absence of purpose that left me nothing to remember. I tend to believe it was the latter.Two stars for an honest attempt at originality.",

But that isn't such a bad thing, he was a prolific writer and you'll not soon run out of material. Fer-De-Lance is the first Stout published about the now famous team of inspiring, albeit grumpy and slighly neurotic, genius detective Nero Wolfe and charming legman Archie Goodwin, who frequently purposely ruffles Nero's feathers. This book is definitely worth reading. Highly entertaining, with one caveat: if you have never read Wolfe before, begin with a different one as your very first. Try Some buried Caesar, or The Silent Speaker first to help you develop a feel for this incredible duo....then I think you'll appreciate Fer-De-Lance more. (You can also find Nero Wolfe on cable TV... a serious treat for any Wolfe fan) Enjoy!\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

He has the rare and admirable quality of being able to hold a roomful of football players spellbound with anthropological theory. Although we dissected the Yanomamo culture in depth, Devore hardly glorified Chagnon's study, or referred to the Yanomamo as an \"inherently savage\" people. In fact, he tended to be critical of Chagnon's methods and such broad cultural characterizations. As an anthropology concentrator with a primary interest in primate biology, I also feel I can safely attest that his knowledge of primates is likewise solid and I recommend his writing on them without reservation.",

The chord progressions are trite and simple. The production quality is lousy. The lyrics are about uninteresting people who have no socially redeeming qualities. The singing hurts my ears. Lou Reed is a terrible lead guitarist, and when he attempts to play \"fast\" he is about as lousy as they get. Sell this CD at a used record store and get a life! Spend your money on something else.

The book is hilarious. It is supposed to be the life and opinions of the narrator. Instead, it takes about fourhundred pages to even get to when he was born. The book radically changes tone in the last hundred pages (as, I think, Sterne was nearing death), and the then present day Shandy is finally presented. Some of these scenes are touching, but the final chapters become redundant. The book is completely inconsistent, the narrator interrupts at all possible times ... But it works!

The stunts are absolutely marvelous and astounding, this is top-notch physical comedy -- regardless of it being a silent movie from 1923.However, the soundtrack to \"Sherlock Jr.\" is a modern score by The Club Foot Orchestra that simply doesn't belong here. Some may perhaps like it, but myself I'm a bit conservative and prefer the original music. Occasionally there is an electric guitar, a sax, in one scene there is bluegrass, and in a chase scene there is a hint at 007... Sorry, but I find it absolutely out of place, I actually preferred muting the sound on this one.Apart from that: Great!\nAnswer:",

His sides with Oscar Peterson's legendary group added nuance and a subtle shade of soul to already perfect performances. Unfortunately, his often-times subdued playing meant you almost never really heard him play. This exceptional 1958 date, his \"first\" for a major label, is filled with brilliant playing. And though he doesn't aim for pyrotechnics, the album contains soft-hued pieces brimming with quiet soul and just a hint of his Texas swing roots. The remastering on this reissue is first-rate and brings the recording's nuances right to the fore. And for those of you who (like me) fell in love with his style, there's loads more out there... Ellis deserves a place of honour along with Grant Green, George Benson, Wes Montgomery, Charlie Christian, Barney Kessel and Joe Pass as a genuine genius of jazz guitar. Very easy on the ears, very relaxed riffing, very eye-opening performances. A perfect introduction.",

They give a lot of blood to the gods, but it still doesn't rain! In the process of giving blood, there are some very disgusting parts. Meanwhile, strange things happen to Balam. A fish from Xibalba (the underworld) appears, and he meets his dead twin brother and mother. Eventually, they decide someone must be sacrificed.

It's a brilliant movie! for a movie made in the fifties it's a 3-Dimensional movie covering a lot of ground. Is this cute little unfeeling killer carrying a genetic code that dooms her? Is this science, a bad-to-the-bone child murderer or just a brat without boundaries? And the final thought... does God step in? Heavy duty stuff.

There were parts of the story that I enjoyed but I found some of the graphic sex scenes to be disturbing and totally unnecessary to the plot. Smith went into such detail during some events of the story (like the weird sex scenes) and yet the last part of the story seemed to be rushed through. I found myself interested in the story but not dying to know what was going to happen next (like I felt while reading some of Smith's other books like The Seventh Scroll and River God.) Wilbur Smith is an excellent author and I will probably read Monsoon which is the continuation of Birds of Prey. I hope to be swept up in the adventure and NOT able to put THAT one down.",

This is as close as you can get to someone that spent his whole life, gathering together the \"Primary Source\" stories that make up the very base or start of what we think we once were. Out of Fraser's work came a lot of \"Digging\" and additional looking, but no one ever got quite so much into the 12 to 14 volumes....YES that's right! St. Martin's Press, in the old Flat Iron Building in New York, should still have a few sets. Get the complete set. And an OED and a good link (DSL, ISDN) on the WEB to an ISP that is not going to go up in \"Smoke\" and \"Insider Profit Making\".

I do not think Elton knew how to deal with his fame and got carried away with his ego and less with his abilities. His albums AFTER this one do not come close to the earlier ones like Tumbleweed, Madman, Honky Chateau or Don't Shoot Me. GYBR is a very good album- with some great material. A few of my favorites are Sweet Painted Lady, Grey Seal, All the Young Girls Love Alice, Funeral/Love Lies Bleeding, Danny Bailey, I've Seen that Movie too. Definitely worth buying!

I asked the clinique lady for an eyeliner that wouldnt run and she looked at me funny, and said \"well....we have this...\" and handed me the eyeliner. I should have just walked away because the look in her eye I could tell something was NOT right. I bought it anyway- i honestly hate this product and its not worth the price. ive tried cheap drugstore eyeliners that have worked way better than this 20 pencil! It WILL run...smears terribly. Once applied do not touch ur eye. Within an hour it will smear so if u purchase carry around tissues to keep your eyes clean so you wont look like a racoon. Sharpness doesnt last long.

Did she get the others right? 2) In many recipes she says \"unplug the machine\" at one point or other in the process, making it very clear that she's not familiar with how machines work....or the simple expedient of pressing the reset/cancel button to achieve the desired effect. When an author is so far off on basics like this, there's no point in wasting time finding out about the other mistakes, or in wasting money on the book. There are number of bread machine books out there that give the diversity of recipes Hensperger attempts, and do a far better job.",

        "Title: Utterly stupid\nReview: As a philosophy professor for three decades, I have taught this wretched book several times in survey courses in 20th century philosophy. It has gone through numerous printings, and so has seemed to capture the respect of a good number of Anglo-American professors. However, Reichenbach's reading of the history of philosophy is wrong on every count; it is no wonder that Einstein, whose student he once was, ridicules Reichenbach in \"Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist.\" Although I endeavored to keep my view out of lectures, my undergraduates were able to point to Reichenbach's superficiality and his errors at every turn.So, one might ask--what is its attraction? For people who would like to avoid the considerable labor of studying the great thinkers of the past with seriousness, this book gives them an easy excuse not to. The book is a pathetic exercise in uninformed and biased revisionism.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

This book is horrid. It lacks literary value. Any hidden meanings must have been merely coincidental, considering the probable intellect of the author. It's rather unfortunate that it somehow worked its way into the curriculum of some schools. It's sad to think that impressionable students are forced into reading and assessing this book by people that probably thought it was wonderful. I highly anti-suggest this book.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Jaws is my all time favotrite Speilberg movie. The directing seems no holds bard and Speilberg even says that he was very stupid and out going at the time.I'm pretty sure that we all know that this movie is great so I mine as well move onto the extras. Because this is got extras out the anous!! Sorry. Anyway, its got some great extras like an hour long making of the film that is very insight full. They tell you stuff that you have never heard before.Other extras include theactrical trailors and some great deleted scenes. My favorite cut scene would have to be where Quint goes into a music store to buy some piano wire. A kid begins to play a flute and Quint begins to heckle him.If you enjoy extras i also recommend \"Brazil: The criterion Collection\"\nIs this product review negative?",

This is like much of Faulkner's writing: Chapters made up of single paragraphs, made up of single sentences. As I read, I annotated to show some natural breaks.I know others who can dive into this kind of book and really get something out of it. I guess I should give it another chance and exercise my brain a little more. But if I do get into it again, I have a strong temptation to rewrite it in the style of Ernest Hemingway.I have all of Garcia Marquez fiction and some nonfiction available in English.

Every couple mins I would get a message on my screen saying the \"Wireless Access Point could not be found.\" When I plugged my D-Link wireless notebook card back in, it worked perfectly...same signal strength, but it never lost the connection. BTW, also bought a Belkin USB wireless adaptor for an old Win98 machine and the installation CD was practically useless.

I am a real person, have used this product for over a year and like it very much. I am at an age where I look for \"Age Perfect\" products, or more often \"Age Fighting\". This eye cream is light, not greasy and makes the area around my eyes feel moisturized more than just using a day moisturizer alone. It seems to me my crows feet are less noticiable also. I am blonde and have fairly sensitive skin and have had no problems with any type of skin reaction. What Jesse needs to realize is that anyone could have a reaction to an ingredient in any product that they are allergic to, that doesn't mean it isn't a good product for someone else without the allergy.

The thing is, he has no short term memory, so he can't remember if he does it or not (I sure as heck don't want him running around my neighbourhood). With the help of his so-called friends Natalie and Teddy (portrayed by Carrie Anne-Moss and Joe Pantaliano, who both starred in The Matrix), he tries to find who did it. But who can he trust? Who can truly help him find the murderer?

Nora Ephron's movie makes Julie Powell out to be a quirky, fun person who takes on a daunting task, perseveres through many challenges, and learns life lessons from following in Julia Child's giant footsteps. Nora also splits her screen time between the two characters, drawing interesting comparisons between the two women.Unfortunately, Julie Powell's character in the book comes off as whiny, self-centered, alcoholic, and intolerant. In the movie, Julie is thrilled and amazed that people start reading her blog and commenting. In the book she scorns her readers, amazed that anyone would waste their time. The way she mocked their interest in her blog was unpleasant, along with her lack of respect for her long-suffering husband. I read about a third of the book, but there are too many good books I haven't read yet to waste more time on this one.\nAnswer:",

The research is still prodigious, but I suspect at this point O'Brian has the topography and culture of early 19th Century Europe so much a part of him that he is now on automatic pilot. Well, he's entitled at this point. As usual, situations and characters are introduced, then never heard from or of again. Maturin's naivete is a more than a bit tiresome at this point.

As an 18 year old book lover, I thought I would give this book a try. Nobody forced me to read it, I read it for my own enjoyment. I just did not find this book interesting. I kept thinking..Santiago, let that fish go and row back to shore. Was it really worth all that trouble? I gave this book two stars because the book had one or two genuine moments in it that inspired me, but I did not care for the story as a whole. The book left me disappointed, so I started reading \"A Brave New World\". It is a much better book, in my opinion.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

There is a character in the book that everyone can identify with and come to understand their world from a more insightful perspective. McCullers makes a brilliant showcase of life not as it should be or how we hope it will some day become, but as it is, without artifice or evasion. She allows us to look at ourselves without pity or self-loathing and without rationalization or retribution. We can see ourselves simply as human.

This, I believe was my first Jessica Alba movie, and will most likely be the last. Most of the acting in this was sub-par and then some.

First, it has far fewer works than its competitor, the Penguin Guide 2000. Also, several features from earlier Gramophone guides have been dropped. There are no longer \"alternative selections\" -- just the 2 or 3 that the Gramophone editors prefer. So, if you want to know whether a certain recording is a well regarded one, you're out of luck unless its one of the 2 or 3 Gramophone lists. So, there's nothing to help you differentiate most excellent recordings from the rest (and there are far more than 2-3 excellent recordings of most classical music peices). Also, there are no \"G\" ratings. In previous editions, recordings would also be given 1, 2, or 3 \"G\"s in order to indicate the level of regard the authors held a good recording in. Finally, the \"Gramophone 100\" listings are gone. As a final sad footnote, the \"beginner's\" library can only be called a joke.\nAnswer:",

The author skips around, while changing the original premise of the book, so you are often at a loss about what is going on. It's as if she's trying to tell the \"real\" story of what happened in the original book. She throws in various hints at sadism and lesbianism, and I wonder if this was just to create a buzz about a book she herself knew wouldn't make much sense. The characters come off as disgusting, even making Jane a jello-headed twit. Adele is compared to Rochesters insane wife, and you will find it hard to find one sympathetic character.

There are a lot of concepts in this book that may create fear in some. You have to feel what is being said through the heart center. Your intuitive sense knows the truth (whether the mind knows it or not). This book answered so many questions for me..questions I had had about feeling like I didn't belong, where I come from, etc. The truth of the matter is that the earth is changing in frequency and we need to choose to ascend with it, or to stay behind..this book talks about that too. Even 10+ years later the information is very relevant. Highly recommended for those who are just awakening or anyone already on the spiritual path.\nIs this product review negative?",

Motown is strongly represented here and if you like that music, you'll love this collection. There is a disk devoted to the British invasion artists also.

It reminds me most of any Disney story where Mickey Mouse and Goofy set out to catch a mastermind of some kind.On average, you'll have figured out the whole mystery about five pages before the heroine, Mma Ramotswe, has. Unless you're a seven year old, that is. Then you'll probably just about be solving mysteries alongside the lady detective.Unless you're annoyed by details like every second paragraph beginning with \"She\", you'll find this book an easy read. And there's no doubt the author knows Botswana/Southern African life and everyday language very well, and he demonstrates it through his writing. If you're a sucker for anything African, including the occasional crocodile and snake thrown into the story for no major reason at all, you'll like this book.

        "Title: I learned the hard way\nReview: I originally bout a netgear adapter because it was a little cheaper than the Tivo adapter. I had nothing but problems with the netgear. Poor signal strength (33% or less) and frequent lost connections (a few times per week on avg). I put up with it for about a year or so before deciding to try the Tivo adapter. I read some good reviews, but was still skeptical. Not any more. It worked great right out of the box, much stronger signal (90%) and after nearly one month, it hasn't lost it's network connection even once! This was definitely the way to go.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

The poetry in this book is a collection of snippets from the lives of ordinary but creative people. It proves that everyone can find a little bit of revelation in their lives, in things as simple as a map or mist rising in the cold. And by sending those little snippets to friends they stayed as much a part of each others lives as if they were right next door. I really recommend dipping into this collection and maybe even starting your own haiku challenge...it isn't meant to be classic haiku, but simply enlightenment in daily life, given with love from one friend to another.",

        "Title: END OF THIS LINE\nReview: In 1988, British gay novelist Alan Hollinghurst made a striking debut with \"The Swimming Pool Library.\" Set in the Darwinian landscape of pre-AIDS homo London, the writing was beautiful and urgent, flaring at times to real poetry, while the characters exerted the pull of infatuation. I reached the end of that book resenting the forced separation and wanting to hang out with the whole lot for a lot longer.Since then, each subsequent Hollinghurst novel has been more disappointing than the last. In the latest, \"The Line of Beauty,\" his literary go-cart has come nearly to a halt. The writing is still elegant, studded with memorable turns, but the story is utterly without consequence, ditto the characters. Is Hollinghurst writing or doing his nails?

He's never been funkier than on tracks like Monkey Time, Why Why, and Flames of Love. There are four great ballads, including Love Anyway, one of the best ballads he's ever done. And he also mixes it up a little, throwing in a lot of big band sounding horns on Runnin' Blue and going a little country on Up to You. Of course, the musicianship on every song is incredible. I paid $40 a while ago to get a used copy of this with a mediocre mastering job! I was happy to find that copy, though, and I will gladly buy it again to get the sound upgraded by the new remastering--because it's that good.

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied?\nTitle: Effectiveness depends on the cup\nReview: This pad does get pretty hot, but how well it keeps your beverage hot really depends on the cup that you use. The problem is that most (all?) mugs have a circular bottom, so the actual surface area that contacts the pad is pretty small. That being said, my drink never really got colder than a step hotter than lukewarm, so I guess it works fine!Safety is somewhat of a concern, though. It uses a simple on/off switch, and I'm not sure what will happen if it is left on for days at a time. I think a system where it is only on when a cup is on it would be awesome.Your cup also sits about an inch higher off the table, so risk of knocking it over is a bit higher.Overall, a good and cheap solution to the everyday first world problem of keeping a hot drink hot.",

However, Jim Morris' WAR STORY is an historical account you do not want to miss. In the early years of Vietnam, the author was an Army Special Forces Captain and advisor to both the South Vietnamese army an the indigenous Montagnards. WAR STORY chronicles Morris' adventures--some rather precarious--with these two groups. The battle scenes are vivid, and perfectly capture the chaos of a running gun fight in a jungle. What is best about WAR STORY, however, is Morris' ability to study himself, his comrades, and the war, without flinching. Part of this is due to the author's training as a journalist; also because the book was written in 1979, while the war was still fresh. All in all, this book will show you what it was like to be a soldier in the early days of the Vietnam War, when victory was still attainable.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Indeed, his writings on the age old complexity of eye dominance for the shotgun user is the most concise I have ever read.As a Brittany owner I found this book especially joyful in that the author really does know the breed...the wonderful little French hunting dog to whom the author refers to as God's Bird Dog.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

Where better than old Louie L'Amour's vast collection of works. This title was fast paced, lots of action, interesting characters (the Sean Connery film was pretty close to this novel's storyline) and the usual deadly Apaches and ruthless gunmen out for themselves. L'Amour's novels are condensed, so don't expect a sprawling epic for the most part, just tight stories and lots of gunplay and galloping stallions and sweat. One major problem with this one, his main characters are constantly 'squatting on their heels'. This happens a lot in this one. A minor point, but why know kneeling or one one knee or some such. Lots of hot coffee gets consumed also. Still, a solid action-packed western with a fleshed out lead characer that was nicely done.",

I love it so much that this year ... I read it again, just for fun, during the school year and it only took me two weeks again!! I highly recomend this novel to anyone and everyone in the world!\nIs the review positive or negative?",

She was absoulutely obsessed with outdoor urination and defication. The only redeeming quality to the book is it's meticulous description of the boredom of being trapped during a storm for days on end in a small frozen tent. She talks about being offended by people being interested in the deaths and gore, yet she endlessly talks about body bags, the removal of the dead Koreans, etc. If you want to know climbing from every conceivable angle, it's worth a read, but don't expect too much.\nAnswer:",

The plot involves 2 upper class and intelligent students planning and executing the perfect murder on a random victim for the thrill and the challenge. In the real life case and the Hitchcock movie, the murderers are college students while in this movie, they are alledgedly high school students. The word alleged is used as it is obvious that Gosling and many of his classmates are in their 20's and haven't seen a high school for a few years there.The best thing going for this movie is the lead performance from it's star Sandra Bullock. She is good as the detective in pursuit of the twisted murderers but she has very little to work with here as far as the script, the cliched characters and the weak plot twists. She's a good actress but not a magician and this would fall into her lesser movies and possibly her least.\nAnswer:",

The female's sudden, inexplicable transformation from nasty to sweet is likewise unbelieveable (but predictable). Additionally, the movie was full of unappealing cliches: the female constantly nagging the hapless male, random women fawning all over the male (even though he's nothing to write home about), tough guy getting in touch with his sensitive \"inner self,\" and on and on.

I am not a fan of colorizing anything, but since they kept the original intact, I did enjoy watching both.Now on to the film.

I would have liked to see more of the childhood. Maybe a touch of inner dialog from Todd. And then towards the end...wish I could know what happened to the colonists and the soldiers.

This product was well thought out and manufactured very well, especially for a product costing only about $10. It has an on/off switch right on the base and a power on light right next to it. I would not want one with an in-line power switch. The unit is sturdy and feels good quality. The power cord is heavy and plenty long, as needed for most desktop situations. I have used it with a number of different cups, all having a small ridge around the bottom, and they all work equally well. The coffee stays at just the right temperature, and the cup doesn't get uncomfortably hot. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good cup warmer.

It is an OK movie, but if you're expecting the laughter that was based on the lines in the first film, you'll be disappointed in this one.\nAnswer:",

This generation has gone too long underappreciated as useless old farts by the Boomers, Xers and the latest generation. We forget that they built modern America thorugh their sacrifices and just plain old determination. While one might quibble with Brokaw's claim of this generation being the greatest (how about the revolutionary war and civil war gens), they are unquestionably the greatest alive today. Brokaw chronicles in easy-to-read vivid vignettes the lives of an assortment of WWII vets from all walks of life. While one might yearn for a bit more detail on the transition from wartime sacrifice to peacetime production, its still a must read for putting the accomplishments of this great generation into perspective.\nAnswer:",

The quality is just as bad as everyone said, only the cover is new. It's bad enough what a travesty it is to do this to a great film, but to repackage the some old, same old is adding insult to injury! Why can't Criterion get hold of a decent negative and bring this masterpiece out with their usual excellence? The film itself is wonderful, the best of the best of Italian cinema.

It's free for 15 days. It also gave me an error message saying there are bad partition in my computer's HD and I need to fix those first. I ran the disc error check but everything was fine. Took me whole day nothing worked.I ended up went to best buy and bought a USB 3.0 case \"Rocketfish\" and use the Acronis Migrate Easy 7.0 free demo to clone the HD. Everything was done within 2 hours. So If you are buying a bigger HD, I say don't buy this. I think the problem is there is no power cord, it doesn't support the bigger HD.

The minute my son goes to open one of the towers sides the whole damn thing collapses. This happens everytime. I finally just took the three support things off of it and put them away. The gun launcher thingys on top also continue to fall off. Luckily my sons was purchased on sale for only $14 but it's made so cheap and frustrated my son so much that I still feel completely ripped off.",

        "Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review?\n===\nTitle: Tyranny and terror\nReview: Henry VIII ruled his kingdom, at least towrd the end of his reign, with low political cunning, and a mixture of tyranny and terror. Even those closest to him at court could never be sure about the long-term stability of their positions. His mind was mercurial, and often changed by the last person with whom he spoke, but the final decision, good or bad, was always his. This is an extremely readable work that takes us through the last years of his life, when life around him became extremely bad, not only because of his natural inclination to incite terror, but the very real physical pain he sufered from various problems with his often abused body. This is a cautionary tale of how absolute power corrupts absolutely, and a fine addition to the lengthy volumes on the Tudors.\nAnswer:",

I was anticipating being able to traverse through the fabric of space/time, or global enslavement at the very least, but no, none of that occurred when I hooked them up. The only thing that happened was the soundwaves coalesced into an apparition of some goatheaded creature screaming something about devouring my soul. Pretty unimpressive if you ask me. Hell, I have a $30 set of RCA's that was able to summon cthulhu, and that was no apparition! The sound quality was ok, though a little flat on the high end.

I feel the language in the book is unreal and some of the situations in the book are just plan undescribable and obscene. In my opinion I feel this book should be banned from being read in highschools. There are some students that I know who stated for a fact that they've never seen a piece of garbage as worse as this book and I fully agree with them. The use of language is uncontrolable and plan disgusting. There are people who don't use the kind of language that's use in this book and when they see it they immediately skip over the word because they don't feel right reading such language and they've grown up not using or thinking of using it. To conclude I would like to say taht The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz is nothing but trash and filth for students eager and learning minds.",

The Amp100 does accept the signal from my turntable and pre-amp and puts the sound on the speakers, proving that there was nothing wrong with my system but the dead stereo amplifier. However, although the Amp 100 clearly has stereo output jacks, the signal there will not provide anything useful to the cassette deck. Way down in the fine print of the instructions I discovered that this \"output\" is referred to as a \"pass-through\", which apparently means it is unamplified.

Gems like \"Anthem\" and \"Purple\" have already appeared on previous compilations (Pi soundtrack and Tranceport vol. 1, respectively).

It should have been designed with a handle though.It gets great reception although it can be subject to electrical interference when moving about the room. I find that fine-tuning the dial usually eliminates this completely.The dials feel great to move. I love the tuner dial with the geared indicators, it is easy to tun it just right. Very smooth with just the right amount of resistance. You don't have to worry about bumping the dials on accident.It has a solid, quality feel to it all around.I've not used my iPod on it.

One complies, one lost & confused & one plain intoxicated. Well the compliant one is wanting to marry free spirited Cary Grant (he is innocent yet resolute). Lew Ayers plays the intoxicated brother \"Ned\"; very well, I might add. Katherine Hepburn plays the older sister. She loves her siblings very much & she makes you somehow love them too. Katherine Hepburn plays her part almost too well. She is so good in her roll you really can be cought up in her melancholy. Edward Everett Horton & Jean Dixon bring lightheartedness, wimsy & relief to this movie. Cary Grant is delightful. You are sure to enjoy Holiday.",

        "Title: High Quality CSI\nReview: DVD boxed set of CSI season 3, very high quality video for a DVD. Hardly notice the difference when playing back on a HDTV. 5.1 surround sound does not really work well for a TV series, sometimes the dialogs are softer than the background or effects making the story quite hard to understand, especially when there is no subtitles to go along.\nIs this product review negative?",

        "Is this product review positive?\nTitle: Excellent Book!\nReview: Although i read this book for a class, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The book hooks in the reader by opening out with a tension-filled baseball game. Needless to say, this book is a real page-turner. Furthermore, the book was a very enriching read. The often overlooked customs, history and varying religions of the Jewish religion is covered in a way that doens't put the reader to sleep. The tale itself is also very well-developed, as it shows the clashing between two Jewish realms.The only downfall of the book in my mind, were the unrealistic qualities of a few of the characters. It seemed as though they were too smart for being just teenagers at time, and many of their discussions seemed unrealistic.This however, didn't detract too much from the read, and I'd recommend this to any adult-level reader. Once again; it's a page turner (took me only about 3 days) and well worht the read.\nAnswer:",

Late 2005, which usually gos for around $10 bucks now...Is a stunning visual upgrade from the previous versions. Razor...did I say RAZOR shape compared to previous versions. I project it on my 80\" screen with a sanyo plvZ5 projector, and closeups are just as sharp as HD.(I have the Toshiba HD player and various HD films)...S, if you can't afford the Dec 2007 five disc release...this will be a MAJOR upgrade from previous stuff.DOug TRumball...effects man for this and 2001, CLose Encounters, ABC's classic Logo look in the seventies, etc. always created not just great special effects, but things of great beauty. I wish he was still working in regular film. HE will probably be interviewed on the five DVD set.\nAnswer:",

        "Title: Tabloid Trash with a Bibliography\nProduct review: This book is filled with simple assertions that are quite simply false. Sonu Shamdasani addresses many of these in Cult Fictions. Some things Shamdasani doesn't address have to do with the assertion that Jung was a \"Gnostic Sun-worshiper\" which, in and of itself, is a contradiction of terms much like saying he was a Dionysian ascetic. Other idiocies and falsehoods abound. Anyone with a passing familiarity with Jung's work will find this book hilarious.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

        "Title: DON'T BOTHER WITH 2 DISC SET!!!\nProduct review: Seabiscuit is a good addition to your DVD library, but save the extra money and buy the single disc. I feel taken by the 2 disc set. The only real addition is the Match Race footage which is only a few minutes. The Winner's Circle, HBO First Look and True Story are all re-edits of the interviews and commentaries on the first disc. It's too bad that the studio did this because I will never pay for extra features again. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

        "Title: Not the machine it once was...\nReview: Once a year in Nashville we participate in a city wide ice cream making contest to benefit a local charity. The winner has their ice cream produced by Purity Dairies for a year. Every year I try out different flavors and tweak my recipes to enter. I've won a couple of ribbons for my effort. A few years back I splurged and purchased a White Mountain Freezer because cheaper brands did not have a powerful enough motor to freeze ice creams containing lots of cream, chocolate, or eggs. The good news is that the White Mountain worked--initially. The bad news is that in only a few years, I have had to replace the motor three times and the replacement cost is almost as much as the original machine. Each time it fails more quickly than the time before. Do not rely on the overall rating for this machine as many reviews are written by new owners whose motors have not yet failed. It does make great ice cream, but only for a while.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

        "Title: Afterglow Burns Out Before Starting\nReview: If you're a connoisseur of 60's psychedelic music, don't buy this CD! The music is shallow, bland, and unoriginal. Usually, when I order an obscure 60s psychedelic album, it's expected that about 30-40% of the songs are hidden gems. This album is ALL bad, only containing a hint of decency on a couple of tracks. This is the worst CD I have purchased in a long time. :(\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",
