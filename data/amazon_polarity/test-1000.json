I was reminded of what someone told me about people at their high school reunion, \"a lot of them has changed, but the eyes are the same.\" So it is with PP&M on this album. Of course they've aged and their voices have mellowed. Mary is now dead. But, if you want great Christmas music that you will listen to over and over, this is it. I challenge anyone to listen to the entire album and not tap your foot. The \"Magi\" is \"magic.\" Yes, I'm predjudiced. I grew up with PP&M from their first vinyl to their last MP3. No group has ever harmonized like them. The production of the album is excellent and the children's choir adds that Christmas touch. I highly recommend this album and the video.\nIs this product review negative?",

That's how I feel about OXO International products. And this bargain priced set of paring knife and peeler is no exception.I especially am amazed by the peeler. The swivel action of the blades skims potato skins like fine silk, leaving you unwasted meat of the spud. And those pesky 'lil eyes? --poof, disappear with the nifty corer OXO provides. On carrots, this peeler is a dream. Perfect while making my favorite carrot cake or getting a veggie tray prepared. I've even tried it on firm tomatoes--absolutely perfect for stewing or canning.Good products from a good company. OXO's health concerns have won them awards from the Arthritic foundation. But you do not have to be hurting to enjoy these. In fact, they just feel good in your hands and work great.",

Not much else happens.The third film in the now dead in the water series appeared to be the worst it could possibly get, that is until Joseph Sargent dropped the Jaws The Revenge stinkeroo into theaters a scant four years later.Jaws 3-D is marred by slow pacing, poor effects, a terrible score, and a juvenile script.

They are all here and Clay puts everything into each song. He is one of the most refreshingly cool voices to come on the scene in years and we are all the better for it. At least we can now hear other songs besides \"This is the Night\" which is still good but most people were eagerly awaiting something new and have they gotten it!!!!

They wanted him as their opener so they could see him play live. I figured he has to be pretty good if they like him. First of all he was a one man band. He had a machine that recorded a beat or tune at the beginning then he kept adding to it. He sang and played the guitar along with the songs. It was really good.After doing some research, I come to find out he has four albums out. I just started listening to them, starting with Redemption's son and I think it is a masterpiece. He has a unique quality that is hard to find on any radio station these days. You can listen to it over and overfrom start to finish.

I actually think Bridges to Babylon is one of their finest record (I don't dislike a single song on it) but A Bigger Bang is just not very good. Stuff like \"Streets of Love\" is just awful easy listening, and \"Sweet Neocon\" is just the Stones trying too hard to create controversy during the Bush Years. I did like \"Rough Justice\" for about ten seconds then realized, again, they were trying way too hard to \"rock\".I think the Stones will eventually admit that this record stinks.Thank God for the second side of the Exile on Main St. reissue.

My current cable cutter is a basic straight edge cutter, and it does the job well, but sometimes the cables slip out of the jaw since the blades are straight. So, with this curved jaw, I was pretty excited (as one can be for a hand tool).My tool arrived today and I decided to test the cable cutter out on a piece of shielded 1/8\" stranded wire. First attempt, EPIC FAIL!!! It cut through the plastic sheath and only one piece of the wire strand was actually cut through, the rest, just bent at the point of contact.What's worse? The blade on the bottom jaw got chipped. Very disappointed in this tool, when my generic wire/cable cutter can do the job at half the price. Tool looks well designed and strong, but the blade edge is way too thin and fragile. This tool is being sent back to Amazon...\nIs this product review negative?",

It goes on water thin, dries quickly, and leaves a light, dry, waxy film fortified with Teflon. Though the bottle version is 4oz. it probably will last as long as the 11oz aerosol as there is much less waste.I started using this product to lube O-rings motorcycle chains, at which it excels, but quickly found it a preferred lubricant for most anything that one would want a lightweight lubricant.

Competition and jealousy figure prominently in the time line, which covers many years in the lives of a few sad people. You could say Michael Henchard was doomed from the 1st chapter. He certainly is haunted by his past to the point of no escape. And in fact, it's his past (as well as everyone who was part of it) that fuels the inevitable heartbreak to come. Casterbridge as a central location isn't quite as powerfully stark as Edgon Heath from... Native but the landscape does affect the players in similar ways. A wicked sense of folly usually dominates every novel Hardy has written.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

I bought this video in anticipation of visiting Santiago, expecting film footage and information on the shrine. Instead, it contains about 27 minutes of two old men's comments on their journey through Spain and the surrounding countryside, and only about 3 minutes worth of film or information on the shrine or city itself!! VERY DISAPPOINTING if you are looking for real information, as I was. What a ripoff!!

Yes, nothing but ugly-smelling alcohol (like in a Hospital room).The box did not even look like the luxury-looking box I am used to. Instead, it looked as if was printed on very cheap recycled paper. Not what you expect when you buy an expensive perfume. I could live with the ugly box, but not the ugly smell.I immediately called Amazon, and here is where they deserve 5 stars.

The touted 20 minutes of skip free play is almost exactly that. At 18-20 minutes into a run (just getting started for many runners) the iPod freezes, and can only be unfrozen by plugging it into its recharger. Amazingly, the arrogant tech at Apple recommended stopping running every 18 minutes and plugging the thing into the recharger for a few minutes...really handy for trail runs. To be fair to Apple, the iPod uses a hard drive to store MP3's, and this performance is not unusual; however the inaccurate advertising is unusual, and not very Apple-like.

I expected the novel to be more descriptive, imaginative and more three dimensional than the film but found it to be quite sketchy and without fluidity. It jumped from past to present and from scene to scene quite disjointedly and I found it difficult to continue reading for I felt like I'd read the same paragraph over and over. As a result of this the only characters which seemed to convey themselves as three dimensional were that of Rick and Sheryls'. There didn't seem to be any revelation at the end of the story, I guess with having knowledge of that era that it would be quite obvious in the way things ended, with broken teenage love and little thought for the result of that. Quite disappointing overall, though worth watching the film.\nIs this product review negative?",

I suppose back in the 1950\"s this was a fresh new picture of totalitarianism, but today pick up any newspaper and you see this story all over our modern world. It's not that I think Orwell isn't relevant, it's just that I think high school English teachers could do a little research, find books that are well-written, expand horizons, but that lift people up, not depress them. Maybe books that would help kids, at their vulnerable age, to laugh, become wiser, and look at others with more compassion. \"Cold Sassy Tree\" comes to mind.

The part where the priest baptizes that women who was dying with the arrow in her neck shows the true charity of what the Jesuits were doing. He was a man who was tryin to save a hopeless and ignorant people. It shows that some people are just destined for hell and how few get on the road that is narrow. The priest litterally takes on evil and satan when he goes into the forest. He deals with abandonment, torture, and death. But in the end people were saved and the greater glory of God shown, and thus his accomplished his mission as far as saving some souls.

The Clanton/McLaury gang were cattle rustlers, but did that justify their being gunned down in cold blood? Tom McLaury was unarmed but still shot and killed by the Earps. Ike Clanton and Billy Clairborne were both unarmed and ran away, but still the cowardly Earps took shots at them.There were no \"good guys\" in the \"gunfight\" but there were players who were more in the wrong than the other, and those were the Earps.

The story line--Halloween creatures taking over the holiday of Christmas--has, from what I know, never been carried out before. Jack Skellington is the lead character who attempts to take over Christmas. The irony of this story is that the lead villian turns out to also be a hero. That, again, is a display of sheer brilliance and creativity. And it is true -- almost everyone in our modern era loathes musicals. I do too. But there is something quite masterful and creative about the way it is presented in this film.Although the movie is 10 years old, it will likely be quite timeless. There is nothing about the story that indicates the time period. The graphics are still of very high quality -- to the point that it is somewhat like \"eye candy.\" I was mesmorized by the graphics.

This book was created for serialization and so comes across in a somewhat repetitive chapter formula. I read this in grade school and have yet to find anyone who truly disliked it. Journey To The Center Of The Earth is also a Classic, but I prefer this. Well written, with a unique story and good visuals throughout. The reader can clearly identify with the characters and their view of being on the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is an enigmatic person with many layers. In this one will see Man vs. man, and man vs. nature. For some the descriptions of various Marine life may seem over done. For me they gave context within a slide show of what truly made Captain Nemo tick. Mr. Verne's book deserves the appelation, \"far ahead of its time.\"",

After reading The Six Sigma Way, you'll probably be ready to jump out of your chair and immediately follow in these companies' footsteps by launching a Six Sigma initiative of your own. The authors, three consultants who teach firms to implement Six Sigma efforts, convincingly extol the money-saving and efficiency-enhancing virtues of the holistic approach. This book offers a lot of jargon and complex concepts, but the material is presented in easily understood charts and lists, and there are plenty of concrete examples. We [...] recommend The Six Sigma Way to managers who have heard wondrous tales of Six Sigma, but would like a more down-to-earth explanation of how it can be used and the benefits it offers.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

The script by Robert Towne (winner of the Oscar for best original screenplay for 1974) is justly famous as perhaps the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. This is not only a superior detective story but one of the most incisive studies of the morality of the American ruling class ever committed to film. Truly, Roman Polanski's best film with great performances by Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway (both Oscar nominated) and John Huston in a memorable turn as the face of evil.If you have lived in Los Angeles, you will not want to miss this film as it details the machinations that brought water, and the Valley, to the city of angels.

Vreeland sets the novel up as a series of short stories, each about the painting's respective owners and the spiritual/emotional impact it has on each of their lives. She succeeds in letting each story flow naturally, with imagination and gentle creativity, plucking out a moment in time in the life of each owner and allowing the reader to experience fully the circumstances of their lives, the circumstances within which the painting has comes into their possession, and the direct impact the painting has within that context. It's a daring piece of writing for a relatively inexperienced author (I believe this is her second book) and, to her credit, she handles it quite well, even if some of the vignettes are stronger and more passionate than others.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

Needless to say, when the new DVD version was released I instantly snapped it up!The story is about a widowed Government official (Cary Grant) and his three unruly children. A chance meeting throws the beautiful Cinzia Zaccardi (lovely Sophia Loren) into their lives. Cinzia is the daughter of a prominent classical conductor, and is looking for a change of scene. When she decides to become the children's nanny, no-one is prepared for the hilarity and heartache that is to follow...This is indeed a lovely family film, with a few shades of \"The Sound of Music\". The new DVD version offers an average-looking transfer of the film, with a photo gallery and two trailers as the extras.Also starring Martha Hyer, Harry Guardino, Paul Petersen and Eduardo Cinanelli.

While I'm sure there is complexity in the words, it's hard to overlook the basic fact that almost nothing happens in this first of the sentimental novels.However, I can readily admit that it's obviously at least somewhat preference given all the glowing reviews I have found. I like my books character driven. The kind of characters that I walk away feeling like I know them personally and am sad to part ways.

I cannot imagine a better companion.Abbey had a spiritual connection to landscape that is both intoxicating and addictive, and his plainspoken narrative connects the reader to the depth of his desert experience in an uncommon way. But perhaps the most moving aspect of Desert Solitaire (indeed, all of Abbey's writing) is that the reader, by associating himself with the book, is called to action. This is not a book, nor is this an author, for the passive observer. Someone who wants a nice tale of living in the desert ought to look elsewhere. For anyone who's restless and ready to confront his or her spirit in a purposeful way, inspiration awaits!",

And by the books end, you feel you've rambled the whole way with him and seen what he had. This is an American classic on par with the Autobiography of Mark Twain. No American history book or teacher or what have you can give you a tenth of what this book can---i.e., the ethos of the American people who suffered many trials and tribulations, depravations and hardship, and yet managed to still be beautiful.

This is because `Casino Moscow' was written by his young nephew - Matthew Brzezinski. Plus it portraits Russians in the most unpleasant light - some people like that! Certainly, to his credit, Mr. Matthew Brzezinski has reached new heights in his creative Russia - bashing. The author has actually moved a full circle from his uncle's traditional Truman-like anti-communism to the age-old loathing of everything Russian by the Polish ultra-nationalist aristocracy from Marshal Pilsudski camp.I am not sure if this loathing is unjustified, but the question I am asking is simple: is Mr. Matthew Brzezinski really the right person to represent US business community in Russia (as a WSJ correspondent), or may be he is a little biased to bridge Russian and American points of view? No wonder US investments in Russia are less than in Costa Rica.\nIs this product review negative?",

I did not do that in the case of Every Sunday. This book was horrible from every angle. The characters were stereotypical, one dimensional at best, the dialogue was childish and the plot a complete and utter joke. To be brief: Before the older father dies, he tells his son to say goodbye to his long time mistress. Turns out the son meets and falls for the mistress after they meet. The mistress is a professor at Brown University. The son is an uneducated goombah with gold chains around his neck who runs his dead father's hardware store. The son's big claim to fame is he knows someone at the parking violations bureau to get your parking tickets expunged. You couldn't make up a dumber plot. And have I mentioned how weak the writing was? Unless you want to laugh at how bad a published book can be, stay from away from this trash.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

Using the software on CD (included in the package) can add \"date\", but you need to modify each picture which is not convinent. Another issue with this camera is it uses Memory Stick Pro Duo.

Juno had an affair with Sarah's late husband. That was bad. But she was vilified even more for accidentally killing another girl in the insanity of a battle with some of the crawlers, then leaving the girl when she fell to the ground. I'm sorry, but with the wound that she had, I would have expected her to be dead. But, when Sarah wounds Juno and leaves her behind, I lost all interest in seeing the main character survive, which is just as well, since the movie doesn't give us any indication that she escapes the caves.

This film would have been much better if Clint Eastwood trained a male character. Then you could take it seriously. By the end of the flick, when Clint Eastwood kills Hilary Swank with a lethal injection because she is paralyzed and want's to die, it gave mercy killing a new meaning.

        "Title: Suspect Motives\nReview: The greatest impediment to enjoying a novel (for me) is when characters act in ways that don't make sense, thus poisoning the rationale for the story line. Even given the notable lack of self-control of Cornwell heroes when it comes to women, in this case the major plot line was Thomas abandoning his course for the woman. The only motivation offered for Thomas's attraction is her beauty. But there is absolutely no indication of any character lurking beneath the body! I haven't counted, but I doubt she has more than 30 words of dialogue in the entire book. For the hero to make a 90-degree behavioral turn for a woman, one has to understand the woman to understand why he would do so. Because there is no credible explanation, the book from a story perspective has to fail. I hasten to add that the historical accuracy, battle scenes, etc. are Cornwell's normal high quality.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

The female character was equally pathetic for putting up with his obnoxious behavior.

If I wanted to read about love, sex, anger, grief and subsequent angst I wouldn't buy a book touted as a mystery. The real enchantment of the beginning books in these series was Kay Scarpetta as a professional in the fascinating field of forensic pathology. Her character was fleshed out in a realistic way by her relationships with Lucy, Marino and Benton AND there was real mystery to be solved. Now, Lucy is a basket case and so is Kay. Benton is dead and may be lucky at that and poor Marino isn't getting the attention his character deserves. Bray and her sidekick are one dimensional (where in the world did they come from?) and the sub-plots were an annoying distraction. My overall impression is that the author is falling apart. It is my sincere hope that she gets back together. But in the meantime don't waste your time with this book.\nAnswer:",

Sure, sometimes it does become annoying and you lose your place a lot, or you can't understand what's going on or who's doing what. Yet, it was still good. The book was, though, within the greater whole, a well written believeable piece. Some of what happened could happen and some of if really isn't that believable. Yet, with how well Golding described it as if he was actually seeing it, that helped get the effect of it being real. Also, none of us really know what would happen if we got stranded on an island. So we don't know how true or untrue the whole actions of the situation are. Some people might agree or not with what all I have said, because everyone interprets things differently, but this is what I think\nIs the review positive or negative?",

Very sticky but did not leave a residue when we took them down and moved them into the birthday boy's bedroom. Unfortunately, while they went on our textured walls great, a lot of the appliques don't *stay* on, and slowly peel off over time. However, this is not at all a deficiency of the product! Our walls are heavily textured, so I was surprised they stuck at all and stayed in place for as long as they did. In my son's room, some of them haven't moved at all in months, so if your walls are smooth or only slightly textured, these should work just fine.The range of sizes is pretty big - some of the decals are only about 2\" in diameter, while others are 14\" X 16\". We used two sets of Superman decals, this and a slightly different set, and between the two got good coverage in a standard 13' X 13' room.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

Seems pretty durable and nothing moves around. I got 2 of these and would get more if/when I need the storage.Pros- Inexpensive compared to similar offerings- Plastic has nice texture and seems durable- Has spot for lock(s)- Hold 4 pistols easilyCons- Price (it can always be cheaper!)- Hinges look like they would be the only thing to ever break on the case, but they seem sturdy enough so that might not even be a con.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

This is one of them. This truly stands amongst other fascinating books in history.Shems Friedlander takes you on a journey from the most basic logical way of living to the most insightful understanding of the ***meaning of life*** itself. I couldn't believe my own eyes (and mind) as to how clearly and simply I was comprehending the most complex subjects of humanity, all told with many absorbing tales, delivered with a mastery of astonishing ease.Either the author is justly a genius, waiting to be discovered by the world, or he is truly moved by God to produce such a masterpiece, or perhaps both.In any case, if you were given a choice to read one book this year, make it \"When You Hear Hoofbeats Think of a Zebra\" by Shems Fridlander.Being an author myself, I will put my entire reputation on line for this book.Enjoy and Understand.Shaun H.

It has a different cover than what's shown here on Amazon (I bought mine at a local video store) This version is released by a company called Seville and Sports a cover like the VHS Release froma few years back with Optimus.

Granted, the DualDisk isn't copy protected, but why should I pay MORE for a DualDisc just to burn it? I should be able to rip the CD and keep a physical copy in case my computer crashed.

It has a good deal of dry humor - sometimes so dry you almost miss it. I managed to slog thru the whole book, hoping it would get better, but it really didn't. The pacing of the story was very slow, and there was no real sense of suspense or building towards a climax. The high point was barely a bump in the road. There were just too many subplots and points that distracted my attention, most of which didn't have enough of a payoff in the end when the threads tried to come together (and many of them didn't link at all) I suppose some of the plotlines were intended to be red herrings, but it is overkill when you're completely distracted and bored by long tangents that have no satisfactory resolution.\nIs this product review negative?",

But I'm sure that half of these \"great\" books are written with a meaning intended by the author and then the critics and readers assume that there is some great meaning behind everything so they make up something just to make sure they don't look stupid. These made up themes are then told to people who tell others and so on.Over all not worth the reading!",

        "Title: Review from a runner\nReview: This gaget is a great way to take your entire library out with you when you exercise. Most people are aware of the plusses... I thought I'd write up what I think are negatives.-- I didn't like how you have to purchase a sleeve to carry the ipod in. Most mp3 players come with this accessory. (You also have to purchase other accessories, which I think is a racket)-- Choosing which songs or playlist you listen to is difficult when you're on the move. My other players have buttons that are easy to feel and navigate once you learn where they are.--For the same reason, it's also difficult to change the volume.When running, I actually prefer my older mp3 player that doesn't hold as many songs as my ipod. I think if I had known it was so difficult to search and change the settings while running I'd have chosen a different player.\nIs this product review negative?",

I am getting two copies this time - one for me to keep and one to share with my nephew who is 15. This is a fabulous book for both adults and children. It is a story about a horse who was pretty homely looking, with none of the pedigree looks that breeders say make a great horse. He wasn't even given the benefit of great training. But he had such a great heart that he became a phenomenal race horse when he was well past the age that he should have even been able to race, even after he had been put to heavy work as a utility animal. He didn't know that he shouldn't be able to race like a champion especially with all the strikes against him! I highly recommend this TRUE story to adults as well as children.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

        "Title: Great Novel - Terrible Edition\nReview: As much as I loved reading this novel, I can't stand this edition. The publisher seems to have written the text in about three minutes flat: \"your\" becomes \"you\", \"my\" becomes \"me\" (except during Henry's dialogue - then it's supposed to happen). There are also a large amount of accented letters ( like \"\u00e9\") that ended up being something like \"\" which makes reading words as simple as \"Op\u00e9ra\" very difficult as it now reads \"Opra\". The publisher didn't even bother to put in the standard chapters that other editions have, which leaves you reading approximately 89 pages without any place to rest the eyes. PLEASE get yourself a different edition: one preferably not from this publisher. A simple publisher's mistake should not detract from such a marvelous text.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

This book is even more relevant today than it was years ago when it appeared as \"fiction.\" How sad that we haven't learned our lessons.

The song is about the loss of a brother and the sadness that comes from an unexpected death. This will be played at his Military funeral.

Clearly written to explore the plausibility of what would happen if the technocratic regime of the socialist state was allowed to take its course, it stretches beyond this very palpable social critique. The final part is the most disturbing and harrowing as one can almost feel Winston's physical and psychological torment in a world that forbids love and legitimates peace through fear.I am amazed that this was written so long ago since these drives in social order seem so shockingly prevalent and the spectre of war as a lever to condition responses from the masses is clearly a vehicle even in the US. It does slowdown in the middle with the very transparent political commentary wrought by Goldstein's manual. Yet the impact of what abuse and harnessing of technical, psychological, social, and political power punches hard at the end.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

Lee's come back was... 'funny, the more I practice, the luckier I get.' How does this apply to Kelly? Really, Kelly, you did get lucky. No doubt about it... lucky. I really believe she can't sing without yelling it and that really gets to be annoying after a bit (a very short bit) as well as there is nothing unique to the sound of her voice as compared to Jann Arden, Amy Sky, Carolyn Dawn Johnston and the list goes on.

        "Title: A good summary of Theravada Buddhist teachings\nReview: Anybody interested in pursuing an understanding of Buddhism and Buddhist teachings can tell you how overwhelming it can be to try to sift through the religious texts. First of all, the Pali canon is quite huge, such that it would take a lifetime to read and absorb it all, and the printed versions of it (in Pali, there is still no complete English translation) are anywhere from 35 to 58 volumes. From this vast ocean of scripture Bhikkhu Bodhi effectively organizes it into chapters based on major points of doctrine. Each chapter has a few pages of Bhikkhu Bodhi's own interpretation and explanation, but the bulk of the book is devoted to the scripture. I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to better understand Buddhism (including Mahayana Buddhism). As for those who are as intensely interested in Theravada Buddhism as I am, I would say that this book, along with a good translation of the Dhammapada, is essential.\nIs this product review negative?",

I have to admit that the creation of the comic book atmosphere is well done, and the acting isn't bad within the requirements of the plot. What turned me off was the over-the-top non-stop sadistic violence, and the total lack of any character that one could empathise with. The film works startlingly well at creating its sick dirty world. It just isn't a world that I think any mentally healthy person would want to spend time in.PS Judging by the percentage of people rating this review as unhelpful, I guess only fans of the film are reading this review!

It's not my favorite but I admit it is very good....and it has some of the most touching, wonderful moments of any of her films.The mean old lady, \"Fraulein Rottenmeier,\" played by Mary Nash, has too big a role in the second half of the movie making for a number of unpleasant scenes. I had gotten so involved with the story that I couldn't stand to see this mean woman so nasty to \"Heidi\" (Temple). Also, there was only one song-and-dance number and that's not enough for a Shirley Temple movie, in which we come to expect songs-and-dances.The other characters were fine. Arthur Treacher provides good humor; Jean Hersholt is great as the gruff-then-loving grandfather and Marcia Mae Jones is nice as the young invalid.This is a true classic story and ends with perhaps the most gorgeous and sweetest smile I've ever seen on Shirley's face.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

All I heard was an overly breathy, average singer whose range isnt great [but like the advice in the Sondheim song she \"modulates\"] and who lacks all a real singer's talents when it comes to interpreting and playing with the melody.To compare, I think Connie Evingson has a similar kind of voice, but is a MUCH better singer and interpreter of jazz music. And if you want to listen to REAL jazz greats, I suggest Carmen Lundy and Paula West.Maybe it's just my taste, because the other reviewers had quite a different impression of this singer. I think she was carried along by a great band, but if you like the singers I've listed, I doubt you'll like Carol",

I didn't like the women he falls for...and didn't think they had much chemistry at all. I actually quit reading this book in the middle of it because I was so bored and started another book.

There are some points about it like the performances of Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou that make this film a little better than what it is but other than their grand efforts to be better than the script, the movie just falls apart in every area excerpt their performances which is in fact better than the film itself.I hold much respect for the efforts made by Weisz and Hounsou but not even divine intervention could have saved this movie.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

It is difficult to actually get the tape to roll properly, but the most frustrating part is that it is doesn't cut the tape. The cutting feature is the most important part. I even went to the product's website and watched the video to make sure that I had inserted the tape properly and was using the dispenser correctly. I was doing everything correctly.

His mouth noises unsettle me, and his slow, dull, expressionless rendering of this classaic grates on the spirit.

Really, enough was enough. It was a \"B\" movie that my family really looked forward to & was sorry to have missed on the big screen. My children (8, 10 & 22 years old) asked 3x in the 1st 1/2 hour \"Are you sure this is King Kong?\" then later, \"Is it over soon?\" though they knew it wasn't by a long shot. Nothing beats the original, as corny as it might have been.

My only complaint is that it is written with the assumption that you already believe, to an extent, its main thesis: that Christ's teachings were not exclusivist.

When installed on the bed, there is a support bar underneath the mattress - it connects to the other side of the mattress and that is what keeps the rail hugging against the bed.However, the bar is only about 1/2 the size of the mattress and then it turns into a strap for the other half. So the half of the bed that is sitting on this bar is elevated. Why couldn't the support bar just extend all the way across the mattress?Doesn't seem right to design a product that has kids sleeping off balance.

The presentation may be out of proper historical order of the flights now and then but it isn't a big factor.I watched moon walks on color tv, live from the moon, back in those days. I also watched people who wouldn't watch the live tv from the moon at all. Strange.Some of the lunar scenes are staggering, at least for me.

Allowing for the possibility of a defective or broken display, I went to a second Circuit City store and got the same results there. They had a store-copy, commercially produced (by MP3.com) sample disc that worked just fine, but none of my Roxio or Adaptec burned CD-Rs or CD-RWs had any function. So, if you like creating your own MP3 compilation discs, and you're looking for a portable box unit that will play them --- this one's NOT for you!Also, there are no tone controls or equalizer pre-sets to choose from on this player.

I went on a total of 12 dives with the camera and it seemed perfectly weighted although I never tried the case without the weight to see if there was a difference. I only gave these weights 4 stars because of the difficulty I had figuring out how many weights I should use. The website listed on the documentation was a dead end so I had to search for the proper website. I found it at the bottom of the following page (take out the spaces): [...] According to the website, my camera only required one weight. I read previous reviews so I put some pipe thread tape on the screw and the weight stayed secure through all 12 dives.",

It definitely helps knowing that a car is coming and how close it is instead of wondering or looking over your shoulder and taking your attention from what's ahead. The mount is easy to install and sturdy. You can tighten it as much as you need to keep it rigid, but it's better not to tighten it all the way so that you can make adjustments on the road if you need it. Also, the frame is plastic and you'll damage it. Overall, it's a great product and I highly recommend it!",

The few songs with Mick and Muddy, Keef and Woody are fun, not spectacular..its a loose blues jam...and Buddy Guy steals the show despite his seriously out of tune guitar.

This is because it's basic flame attack uses no spell points and does a lot of damage. The dungeons in this game are not as huge as MM6, which in my opinion is just fine.

He makes one creepy, yet sympathetic monster. If bad things hadn't happened to his character, if he hadn't been left on his own, would he have become such a creature? Or was he doomed from the start to become an instrument of revenge, because of a secret I won't divulge? And is he really the monster? Or is the monster the woman who wants to turn the junkyard into something else for her own profit?No spoilers here.

        "Title: Not even one wasp!\nReview: I bought one of these traps at a big box store. Installed in my front yard because we have a yellowjacket wasp nest near the front of the house and I wanted to get rid of them. After following the instructions carefully, and hanging the trap about 30 feet or so away, I am sad to say that it has not trapped even one wasp (or any other insect except 5 or 6 tiny flies). After 3 days I moved the trap to another location closer to the nest, but a week later still nothing. So, I conclude that it doesn't work and can't recommend it. Waste of my money, I'm afraid.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

I generally enjoy the writing of Diane Duane.What really spoke to me in this book was how Ms. Duane so accurately captured how it was for me when my mother died when I was a teen. The numbness, how nothing seemed important any more, how hard just sleeping or any thing was hard to do. The stages and feel of what grief is truly.This complete description of how the death of a mother effects and affects Nita's and Diairane's lives and behavior is what makes me urge others to read this book.

To summarize the plot, a scientist revisiting the destructive power of the Oxygen Destroyer (\"Godzilla, King of the Monsters\") creates (inexplicably) monster-sized micro-organisms which can, at times, mutate into one giant monster. This behemoth of a bacteria (Destoroyah) spontaneously degenerates into little bugs and reforms time and again. The whole movie is just too trippy for my taste--I loved King of the Monsters, GvsMechaG, Destroy All Monsters, and GvsSpazeG, but Destoroyah shames the good name of Godzilla.",

The first time I used it it worked great-- sucked up all the substantial pet hair on the floor like magic. The canister is easy to empty and doesn't have a filter to clog like my previous Hoover. So far, so good. However, the next time I try to vacuum, I notice there is no suction... detaching the extension hose revealed that the hose was clogged. I wasn't too perturbed, cleaned it out, and kept vacuuming. I realize that this will happen occasionally with any vacuum, only since that day the hose has clogged EVERY TIME I VACUUM. That's right-- every single time. I have better things to do than clean the hair clots out of my vacuum all the time and decided to say goodbye to cheap vacuums (my previous cheapie Hoover burned out the motor after 6 months)...

Nearly every time we have houseguests, if someone else makes the coffee, it happens to them...poor things. Anyhow, there's gotta be a better machine out there and I will find it..I'm not drinking my a.m. coffee at 3pm so this machine is NOT WORTH THE GIGANTIC pain in the a$$ of cleaning the mess!\nIs the review positive or negative?",

And like I'd even trust the whiny psycho who trapped me there to be truthful about there even being an antidote in the first place. A licensed doctor, I trust. A pissy, self-righteous fruitcake with a leaky brainpan, I do not trust. Maybe the poison was a two-parter with the syringe being the second part. That's an overdone premise as well and would fit right into the Saw movies.And yes, the aforementioned plotholes, especially about him even being able, physically or finacially, to set the whole thing up, makes the movie even less credible.",

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied?\nTitle: The Unknown R&B Soldier\nReview: I knew Wayne Cochran by the single Going Back to Miami. Despite no charted on Hot 100, it was airplayed on Costa Rica's first Top 40 radio station back in 1967. Next year a girlfriend honored me with the generic Wayne Cochran vynil for Chess Records which I lost. Those songs are the reason why I kept looking for WC on CD till I found out this Australian release, so what to think...? I dig Wayne's energy on up-tempo songs but the ballads \"When My Baby Cries\" and \"I'm Leaving Up to You\" got a pure classic R&B with those musicians there. You see, not all that shine's is gold, but this is gold for those who appreciate such rock and soul or blue eyed soul style.",

It is longer and more historically accurate than Tombstone but just as well made. It also features a more realistically stoic portrayal of Earp by Costner and an \"I'm no slouch at playing Doc myself\" performance by the unrecognizable Dennis Quaid who would have been the measuring stick had Val Kilmer not been otherwordly as Doc. This film also features a GREAT ensemble cast much like Tombstone and it amazes me how two separate casts can hit such a home run on the same topic. A must own if you are a western fan.",

The things you're lacking needs to be filled within you, not by someone else. You can't rely on people to validate you or your feelings; it is your own responsibility to find validation and happiness within yourself.

So impressed in fact that instead of sending it back, which I had planned to do, I decided to donate it to my local sportsman's club as a raffle prize. It was the first item selected!\nAnswer:",

There is only one thing about the plot. It's kind of like aliens but that doesn't matter. This movie has some pretty good actors in it like John Savage. One problume with it is the special effects.

Of course, Josh Groban's 'Believe' is the best on there, I'm a HUGE fan of his and he put his all into that song, was very soft and beautiful, perfect for a Christmas album like this one. I never knew Tom Hanks could sing, first of all, he was great, he has SO much energy; Steven Tyler is always the best at whatever he does, Rockin' on Top of the World was great.

(Do not let children watch this!) As usual the script is lousy; special effects are nevertheless amazing.The only reason this film deserves one star is Gabriel Byrne: He was the perfect actor to play Satan.If you're looking for *T2* and the like, stay away from this. *End of Days* is in NO way similar to Arnold's previous films.

Nothing is taken for granted, including the way she carefully chooses each word, each turn in the story.Enter the beginning story with Ellen at her mother's funeral in \"Love is Not a Pie.\" Watch as Henry and Marie contemplate monogamy and negotiate the confines of their relationship in \"Faultlines\" and \"Only You.\" Follow Violet as she watches her sister fall apart in \"Silver Water.\"The endings of Amy Bloom's stories are surprising not because of shocking leaps in logic or tumultuous events, but because the world in each story unfolds so gently, envelopingly, and it is a jolt when each closes up again, leaving you with the imprint of a world gone as quickly as it unfolded.\nAnswer:",

Cindy's story sheds light on what happens when you continue to try and believe that people in the control of drugs will change. Working her way through an unbelivably abusive relationship while raising her young son and trying to care for her unborn child is a testament to what can be done not matter your station in life. She pulled herself from a living hell and took control of her life in order to create some order. The work she is now doing to help others in relationships ruled by the iron fist of drug addiction is commendable and they style and tenor of this book done any other way would just not be as impactful. Take the time to read this book, it will give you a look inside the world of drugs, abuse and show you how there is always light in your darkest hour.

        "Title: Disappointing humdrum non-love story\nReview: I love both these actors, and they're both likeable and cute. But this movie was a dog. Firstly, the plot was very different than the feel of the movie you got from the trailer. Secondly, Ms. Bullock once again plays a soppy loser who orders chinese take-out night after night alone. Despite being a highly successful lawyer, her character comes across as a total loser with no confidence, just a fruity greenpeace nut. This is so disappointing when Sandra Bullock could be so much more. Why does she return to these rolls over and over again?Third, George and Lucy had no spark or chemistry. There was no love story here, just funny little scenes stuck together. The ending was very boring. They should have shown the wedding, except that Lucy's bridal getup was horrendously ugly! She looks like her name should be Agnes or something. See Sliding Doors instead with Gwyneth Paltrow, that was cute.\nIs this product review negative?",

For every \"sucess\" story he tells (a tale of how he got some \"hot\" women to take her panties off for him in 5 miniutes) there are probobly 50 stories of women telling him to take a hike and laughing in his face at his foolish, cheezy, pick up games.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

After a few days I tried listening to it again, figuring maybe I might find something I liked the second time through, but it just seemed \"blah\". I gave it a third listen after a few more days, figuring \"hey, it's Sepultura, there's no way this could really be this dull\" and still just found it plain boring. There isn't a single track on the CD that really grabs me.Apparently other people liked it, or there wouldn't be any good reviews, but I didn't care for it at all.

It actually goes out of its way to be over-the-top stupid, complete with a gym owner (Ben Stiller), so overwrought by a secret eating disorder, he massages pizza while surfing the Internet in his private moments of \"gastroporn.\" He's determined to take over a smaller \"loser\" gym, Average Joes, run by Vince Vaughan. This comedy is a good-hearted fable about the average guy respecting himself and maintaining his integrity in the face of a culture rendered grotesque by its extreme vanity and naricissism, the embodiment of which is seen in the Ben Stiller character. I don't mean to over-intellectualize the film; I simply mean to say that the film, for all its silliness and over-the-top humor, is about something.",

The story begins with Mihaly and his wife Erzsi on their honeymoon in Italy. Mihaly reminiscences and tells Erzsi, who believes her husband is extremely mysterious and strange, about his childhood. Throughout his adolescence, Mihaly is confused about his infatuation with his best friend, Tamas, and homosexuality comes into question along with death and a second birth.During his stay in Ravenna, he is found by an old friend, Janos Szepetneki. This unexpected run in with Janos somewhat inspires him to leave his wife, unintentionally, and goes on a journey where he runs into old friends and manages to transform his psyche. This novel is complete with love, passion, bewilderment, adventure, heartache, and secrecy. And, above all, a graceful acceptance of common-day reality. I give it five stars.",

I figured out who did it and why as soon as she described these characters, and I think it would have been interesting if she had developed the lesbian relationship instead of alluding to it on the last page. A lot of other characters appeared and then disappeared, such as Dow's daughter Blanche. Why did Kinsey never consult the psychic? Why did she even interview Blanche? Why did Sue Grafton even write about it?

Pratchett's secret seems to be that he doesn't spit out novels about the same characters over and over: he has essentially split the Discworld into many almost completely separated series, connected only by cameo appearances of some favorite characters.Night Watch focuses, not surprisingly, on Captain Vimes the Night Watch. This particular story reads much more like a science fiction novel than many of his works, with a pretty common sci-fi theme, but made fresh by Pratchett's perspective.The reuse of such a common theme was why I only rated this a 4, not a 5.

The half-Caucasian, half-aborigine Detective Inspector Napolean Bonaparte (Bony to his friends) becomes involved in this case hoping he's found the perfect murder. A man named Marks visits Windee Station then vanishes. The local police assume he was lost in the bush but Bony has reason to think differently. This mystery is populated with a host of interesting outback characters, aborigines, blackmailers, secondary mysteries, and an awe-inspiring fire. The vision of 1930's Australia is exotic to us in this day and age, yet presented with complete understanding. It is worth noting that Bony and his contemporaries are well aware of his biracial status and some of the language used may bother some. The original copyright of this story is over 60 years ago though, and Mr. Upfield's heart and intentions are in the right place.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Many of those films that stand the test of time are from the Fantasy genre, including Labyrinth and Dark Crystal. Would I add Neverending Story to that list? Hell no. The dubbing is atrocious (funny Germans), and the costumes and \"effects\" are flat-out bad. Labyrinth looks better than many movies released these days, and easily trumped Neverending Story when it was released two years later. The story and plot had the potential to be interesting, but the execution makes Neverending fall flat. And sure, Neverending Story may have advocated reading in the mid-80's, but Labyrinth advocated the use of psychedelics, which is the next step up for mind expansion.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

        "Based on this review, would the user recommend this product?\n===\nReview: Across the country there is a travesty going on. High School teachers are requiring students to read Animal Farm by George Orwell. By the same author there is a much finer example of satire and the multiple levels Orwell attached to each of his books. Nineteen Eighty-Four is simply one of the best books written this century. It approaches a subject matter, Communism, attacks it and then inadvertantly exposes a greater meaning and truth, the essence of freedom. Orwell meant 1984 to be an attack on Russia and what would happen if Stalin and Lenin won. It trascended that and became a handbook for freedom. If anyone doesn't come out a Libertarian after reading this book, they didn't read it close enough. One of the many books that will be on classic reading lists for centuries to come.\nAnswer:",

As is everyone, we are watching the pennies right now, and looked at this set as a compromise between price and quality. It was to accompany the CRT monitor that I inherited from him along with his old Dell computer. After we received it and have been using it for about two months, I am VERY happy to say that there is absolutely NO COMPROMISE when it comes to performance, quality of the sound and appearance. It matches my other Dell components perfectly and I am THRILLED with my system now. My husband is pleased that I do not hog HIS computer any more.

We had to watch this film in one of my film classes. One word: junk. This movie had nothing redeeming about it; I do not care what people say. The lighting was bad; cinematography was shoddy at best, and the acting atrocious. Maybe I am a cynic and am slightly biased towards modernist films. I usually find foreign films to be some of my favorites including Run, Lola Run and The Color trilogy: Red, White, and Blue, but this movie did nothing for me except annoy me and infect me. I am sure none of you agree with me, but I felt I should inform people that this movie is defiantly not as great as everyone says it is and should not be placed on a petal stool.

Jazzy takes on favorite Christmas songs like 'Go Tell It On The Mountain' and 'Away In A Manger' make their debut here, and they're great fun to listen to. This CD has been a part of my family's Christmases since it was released in 2004, and will continue to be. Why? Because the music is good and it gets you in the spirit of Christmas, that's why!

The ones in this movie are pretty outdated. I was bored watching them. This film is recommended for die-hard van Dame fans or nostalgics of the 80's martial arts films. By the way, i didn't buy that this story is true. Well, i did when I was a teenager. Just because Hollywood says its true, one shouldn't have blind faith. I guess in the 80s it was easier to say this kind of lies than now that we have the internet.

Kurt would be really disappointed someone even made a movie about him and he would probably be more pissed that it sucked. He was an extreamly talented musician and he deserves to be remembered way better than the way the decided to portray him. I also beleive he did not kill himself but was murdered. Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, also a very good band, recently stated she beleives kurt was murdered. The fact is though that Gus Van Sant made a terrible movie. Anyone of you trying to force yourselves into beleiving you like this movie don't cheat yourselves you know it was so bad no one could really enjoy it. Even if you are a big fan of Kurt or Van Sant this was bad. If nothing else Kurt tried to teach us to come as we are so don't try to force yourselves to like a horrible movie for the sale of Kurt or Van Sant. I hope this helped someone.thanks zack",

Why have I done this? Just read ALL of the reviews below mine. As for someone saying it rips off \"Dune,\" they're wrong. What similarities it does have are an homage to that great movie and book.

I have never in my life had to do that on any other book.The only thing I really enjoyed about the book was the Japanese man (I can't remember his name because it has been a year since I read it) because I am into the martial arts.Overall, I'd say it wasn't all that good. Don't buy it.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

In TFOH Rand searches for the Shaido and the False Car'a'carn, Couladin. While Rand is going mad Mat is puzzling over what to do about Aes Sedai, what happened to him in Rhuidean, a hot Aiel chick, And two dorrways into different worlds. Egwene continues to be taught of dreamwalking and Aiel customs by The Wise Ones while Elayne and Nyneave hunt Black Ajah and hide from one of the Forsaken. One of the worst parts of this book is that one of my favorite characters, Perrin, is only mentioned in passing and plays no other role. Bottom Line: suffer throgh this book. Hopefully Lord of Chaos will be better.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

I found this to be far more creepy than romantic. It's interesting that this title was determined worthy of reprint at this time.

        "Title: Just Sad...\nProduct review: I've really liked the Warhols, and listened to every recording faithfully since their first. This album is unlike their others, but is that, in itself, a good thing? Some people seem to want to give them points for \"doing it differently\", as if that in itself were of value. Well, to this listener, the only thing that matters is whether it actually sounds good sonically and lyrically, and whether it actually moves me at all. To me, all three questions are answered with a resounding \"No\". This recording does nothing for me except make me turn away from this band, and perhaps wax nostalgic for the time when they constructed and played music that really made me feel something, songs like Genius or Morpheus or Big Indian. Am I living in the past?Perhaps I can't see the greatness of this record, in the way that I can't seem to ever get into the majority of Radioheads' music? I guess I just don't \"get it\".

It is pleasant to look at, and the texture has also made it unique to itself. The print is a good size for the younger readers who are wishing to get into this form of writing.The story itself was great. It gave a lot of insight to how the events surrounding the Lord Of The Rings novels came about. Having read those novels first, 'The Hobbit' answered alot of questions I had. For example; how Bilbo got the ring from Gollum, how the red dragon was involved, the trolls and how they turned to stone. Confusion is gone, and there is more understanding about certain events and situations which take place.I feel it is a fantastic read for anyone who enjoyed the 'LOTR' novels and wish to discover more of the journeys which lead to those events taking place. It can be a little hard to get into, but once you are there, everything falls into place and you don't want to stop reading.",

Well, I suppose there is something to this, but history is history and not stories in movies.

On August 20, 2006, I returned the AW771 headphones and purchased AW772 headphones. I used the new headphones until October 10th. I removed the batteries and unplugged the set as I did not have a need for them until early December. When I was ready to use the headphones again I plugged them in, recharged the batteries and sat down to use them only they wouldn't work. I tried 3 other sets of rechargable batteries to no avail. For both sets of headphones I had to turn my TV volume to maximum to get them to work. I have tried contacting Acoustic Research via Email but have not received an answer.

They seem pretty even to me, I don't want to name the best and worst songs, because my opinion is hardly set into stone. There are also bonus versions of four of the six songs. The original album at 40 minutes is a decent length. The thing that makes this a 4-star CD is that there aren't any GREAT songs, they're merely all good. If it had a song like \"The Egyptian\" or \"Moanin'\", it'd be a 5-star CD.",

He offers his readers intrigue as well as romance in this story of why movie actress, Margot Durning, left the glitz and glitter of Hollywood in the 30's to live a secluded life in the dusty, wind-driven, Oklahoma Panhandle. The author weaves us skillfully in well-blended flashbacks, from Sarah and Leigh's present day romance, to Margot and Clay's 1950's love affair. We are drawn bit by bit into why a box-office favorite would leave her world of success to live in almost total isolation. Congratulations Woody, I look forward to reading your second novel.",

And every time, I put it back on the shelf.It come down to this, if you like the Black Crowes and don't have this album, don't buy it. I read all the press when this came out. The album was supposed to be a return to their early days (ala Shake Your Moneymaker). In my opinion, Moneymaker is good, but not nearly as good as Southern Harmony and Amorica. Although By Your Side has the Shake vibe, it is at best secondhand rehash of that album.In reading the positive reviews about this album, I have to think the authors aren't normally Crowes fans. This album sounded like a hollow attempt to reclaim radio glory. If you like radio rock, it might be for you. If you think the Crowes are best when they are experimenting and grooving (ala Amorica) stay away from this one.\nIs this product review negative?",

I can't believe this is still popular and recommended as a guide for managing people. Its top-down philosophy (sort of a \"manager knows best\" approach) assumes that subordinates must be praised and punished based upon the manager's notion of what's right and wrong.In an environment where professionals with different skill-sets work in teams to accomplish common goals, this book is more dangerous than helpful. So read this to protect yourself from anyone who manages you this way. A much better alternative is \"The 59-Second Employee\" by Andre and Ward, if you need to know \"how to stay one second ahead of your One-Minute manager\".\nAnswer:",

        "Title: Burnin' the \"Midnight Oil\"\nReview: Multi-instrumentalist Jerome Richardson's 1958 session \"Midnight Oil\" smolders nicely. On this session Richardson primarily plays flute (and tenor sax on the first track \"Minorally\"), and he is joined by a stellar band of Jimmy Cleveland on trombone (who sits out on the last tune \"Lyric\"), Hank Jones on piano, Kenny Burrell on guitar, Joe Benjamin on bass and Charlie Persip on drums. Don't burn a lot of cash for \"Midnight Oil,\" but if you can find it cut-out like I did, it's a worthwhile investment.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

The book is well over 600 pages long, but the events in the story appear to take place over the course of just a single day.I have heard numerous people praise this book, but that would seem to be largely posturing because the story is lost under the weight of inadequate editing.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

This version, by far, is the best. The reader actually travels to the Emerald City and beyond as its author L. Frank Baum intended. Mr. Baum put up the money himself to publish the first edition of \"The Wizard of Oz,\" because no established company would touch a \"modern\" American fairy tale. As a result, few books were actually produced, but rarely has an author had such control over his finished product. Here's your chance to own a reproduced copy of his original vision! Books of Wonder has done an outstanding job with the whole Oz series, and the love and care shows on every page.

It took a couple of episodes to get into it, because several new characters are introduced and for a while it seems unfamiliar. But the stories are immensely intricate and satisfying. Great show.Why the 2-star review? Because the DVD \"extras\" are not actually on the DVD. You have to go to a web site to view them.Want to enjoy the extras from the comfort of your couch? Tough! Showtime doesn't want you to.But didn't you PAY for this DVD? Doesn't matter. Shut up and watch the way Showtime wants you to watch. You may think you're a Dexter fan, but you're not: you're a potential video pirate. You're lucky to even get an actual DVD in the box.Plus, the extra interviews are uncut, and the quality is poor.

I figured I'd get a few listens out of it, maybe enjoy it a bit.What an enjoyable CD. Lots of different types of songs on here...some are almost FOLKY, while others are pop-punk type rave-ups, while some are earnest, string-laden ballads. The songs are almost all very catchy and they really grow on you. Some of it is kind of adolescent, but isn't that the point?Some major influences I heard in the music included the Beach Boys, Smashing Pumpkins (very much), the Ramones, Iggy Pop...it's an interesting blend of different styles, but again, the songs remain the main point.

The author has pulled off the difficult trick of showing the world through a child's eyes and yet supplying the reader with adult perceptions. Parts of the plot are predictable, but at the conclusion predictibility flies out the window. The novel may be set in the '50s, but this is not a Leave-it-to-Beaver ending.Anyone with firsthand experience of the fifties may have to stretch their suspension of disbelief regarding certain sexual behaviors by the protagonist's aunt in relation to her nephew, but the author has traded a bit of unlikeliness for a gimmick that elevates this novel from the usual coming of age story.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

At first I thought it just took some getting used to but after using it for awhile now I can see the problem. It starts out alright but the longer you use it fast paced the more it gets \"lost\" and it's hard to aim or have it strike where your aiming.\nIs this product review negative?",

My 3 year old was \"helping\" me put it together for her. The problem was that the music only played when the nose button was pushed and not at any other time as it's supposed to do! The kids got bored with it within minutes. Unfortunately, once it's assembled, it can't be taken apart for return purposes so I lost my money. I would purchase another walker instead if I were you ( one that's returnable).",

I've recently bought a number of Spock's Beard albums and am shocked at not only their sheer talent, but their ability to convey it in such pleasurable ways. It's all a question of style, and Spock's Beard has it...but just not on this CD. This one is a departure from their normal format, the songs being much shorter and the overall demeanor much 'harder'. The hardness comes from guitar distortions liberally distributed in too many tracks, and although I can normally deal with hard (prog) rock just fine, I find this release too obnoxious on balance. Unless you are distortion freak, stick with many of the other SB albums, many of them are top notch.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

This is about a group of people who overcome their own human foibles (Judy faking a letter from Benny; Emma misinterpreting Bob's phone conversation with Ed Harrison) to show someone how much they care. The song \"We'll Follow the Old Man\" is about the camaraderie and loyalty that occurs in a unit that has served and seen battle together. Meanwhile there's a double love story and great singing and dancing. The sets are bigger than life and the costumes are glamorous in a way we don't see anymore.

Got one as a gift and then I bought an extra one later because baby spits up sometimes.Pros:Baby sleeps peacefully in itCan wrap the baby's arms tight so she doesn't squirmMakes breastfeeding easier -- no hands in the way!Cons:The bottom part where her legs go is not long enough-- it starts her kick-reflex and it frustrates her sometimes. I have to shush her for a few seconds then she forgets about the problem.My baby slides down into the bottom part sometimes (even though she is wrapped tightly) and the top part of the wrap starts to cover her mouth and eventually her nose. I have to re-wrap her when this happens (this happens mostly after I burp her after feedings). She does not like the process of being wrapped, so I have to calm her down.I would still buy another one of these if needed and I do plan on getting the bigger size once she gets longer/bigger.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

See IMDB for a complete synopsis- I was hoping to find a copy on DVD rather than VHS, but that doesn't seem to exist. The film was originally shot for theatrical release, under the working title \"Rope of Sand\" on locations in northern Arizona as well as Tucson. If you watch carefully about five minutes in, the detective played by Scott Glenn walks past a tv news crew at the scene of a murder- the bearded fellow in the black jacket next to the tv cameraman is yours truly, and believe me, it was pretty cold in Tucson the night that scene was shot! I never got paid for that extra role, and the film bypassed the theaters, so my 15 minutes of fame (actually, 15 frames) is reduced to a VHS tape. Still, I rather enjoyed the film, and its fun to have a copy to show the grand kids someday.\nAnswer:",

A nice surprise and highlight is the very cool and lengthy cover of Pharoah Sanders' \"The Creator Has A Master Plan\", that previews some guitar phrases that would later turn up on Larks Tongues. Since this was so early in the '72 US tour, the performances do perhaps sound more cautious and polite than they would later get, but having sound quality that actually invites repeated listening more than makes up for this. Highly recommended for Crimso fans and newbies alike; even more so than Islands.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

Upon cracking the binding, I was not impressesd. But, as I got deeper into the story, I was captivated. This is the type of work that makes you look at your life and wonder how you would respond in the same situations (and how you had responded in the past). While Johnson didn't give you dramatic build up that writers of today give, he gave an opportuinty for individual soul exploration. I believe that was the point he was trying to make.\"Autobiography of An Ex-Coloured Man\" was not the greatest work ever written, but is was one of the most thought-provoking and challenging.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

A band that used cool effects, Egyptian scales, and was moderately heavy--the perfect mix for me. Then, Duality came out.Duality demonstrates a lack of creativity that was once there in Ra. I wouldn't say they evolved, I'd say they devoled. They still use effects, but rarely and they don't have as big of an impact. On top of that they hardly sound Egyption on the album. As for this album, Ra sounds more like other bands, but they are still distinct. I just wish they went in a different direction.I do want to say that their are some really awesome songs like Fallen Angels, Undertaken, and Taken.

        "Title: \"Showgirls\" An Instant Camp Classic\nReview: There are many movies that come along which critics feel compelled to call an \"instant camp classic\". Unfortunately, they are simply bad movies for the most part. \"Showgirls\" is another story. A wonderfully tawdry, overproduced, overacted spectacle featuring a goddess of over the top performing, Elizabeth Berkley. She attacks this glitzy trash as if an Oscar nomination were just within her reach. Gina Gershon and the rest of the cast give this beautiful mistake of a movie the aura of pornographic glamour that only big budget Hollywood could provide. Immensely entertaining, and more fascinating each time I view it. If you're ever feeling depressed, or simply down in the dumps, just watch Ms. Berkley sniff her sad little sniff in what is perhaps my favorite scene. Don't let this movie pass you by simply because it has been labeled \"bad\". This is \"bad\" as high art.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

What will the state look like after the revolution?I loved this book. It was easily approached, well organized and easy to walk away from with clarity, after only one reading. That is not always a given with Marxist literature.If you have read Marx and Engels or even just some introduction material on Marxism, this book might help you fill in the gaps around the role of the state, which is always a tricky subject when facing a population fixated on Stalin.If you, like me, always seem to find yourself in debates with anarchists, this book will help you understand the subtleties of the Anarchist vs. Marxist rift. It was worth its weight in gold for that alone. Unfortunately though, at only 100 pages, it wasn't very heavy.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

The Secret Lives of the Sushi Club is the story of four women whose deepest secrets make it into print, thanks to the betrayal of one they considered a friend. In the aftermath of instant celebrity and scandal, they take a rafting trip together down the Salmon River and discover even more secrets about each other. Great surprises I won't give away! This is a powerful story about the mistakes women often make when they're young and not so young, and the joys they share with each other. I loved the male characters too, especially Jina's boyfriend, Mike, who isn't the perfect man, but is so perfect for her you have to root for him. There's even an elk who thinks he's Elvis Presley! The description of the scenery along the Salmon River and the river rafting is wonderfully written. I can't wait to read more of Ms. Yorke's work.\nAnswer:",

However, I was absolutely offended by some of the content of this film. In the first 15 minutes, you're introduced to a lesbian couple as they greet each other with a kiss on the mouth, and then announce that they're having a baby together. In the same scene, the main character uses the f--- word and it sounds like it was inserted into the script simply for the shock value. Also, there's teenage (and adult) premarital sex. Overall the film has a very casual attitude about sex and shows some rather graphic scenes for a PG-13 film. It's just another attempt by Hollywood to get us all comfortable with homosexuality, promiscuity, and a general idea of \"If it feels good, do it.\" I would strongly advise against seeing this movie, especially with kids.",

Mrs. Cleaver or Aunt Bee would be perfect hostesses for this type of game. I can't see anyone born post 1940 being entertained.Overall this book reads like an outdated Emily Post primer filled with information which is obvious.

The effect is that she gets super powers. Matilda is a very intellegent 5 year old. She has a best friend Lavender, who has a parrot for a pet. Matilda uses the parrot in one of her pranks. Matilda has a mom who loves to play bingo and a dad who sells defective cars to people and her brother is just like her dad. Matilda loves to read at the begginning of this book Matilda reads the whole libary. I would give this book 5 stars. I would give it this because this book was exciting and I couldn't put it down.This author thought the book out well.\nAnswer:",

        "Title: Lab-tested and failed!\nProduct review: I usually love Kong toys, but I was disappointed in this one. My 1-year-old Lab chewed pieces off the end within 10-15 minutes of receiving this toy, so I cannot use it to entertain him while I am at work as I had hoped. At first, I was excited to see that he had to work a lot harder to get the treat out than he has to with most treat toys, and he was enjoying himself! Once he got frustrated enough, he started taking pieces off the end, trying to get to the treat. This might be a great toy for dogs who are not aggressive chewers, keeping them entertained for a while, but it doesn't work well for my doggy.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

However, I especially loved \"Very Emergency!\" and \"Electric Pink\". To me, that was TPR playing in a style that didn't require over-stretching. Laid-back pop that made sense and sounded a hell of a lot better than anything on the mainstream radio.That said, Maritime is certainly in that vein. It's not intellectually challenging, but it is up-tempo and extremely catchy. Davey's distinct voice blends well with horns strategically placed.If you want modern emo, watch TRL. If you want well-crafted pop, buy \"Glass Floor\".\nAnswer:",

Many of the special functions of the mouse I could not figure out. In addition, the basic mouse function sometimes worked... other times did not. The \"instruction manual\" that came with the product was horrible. And \"customer service\" at the manufacture? Also horrible. I called them and the phone rang off the hook. Sent them an email and they replied three days later by email indicating that I should call them, but at that time, I did not have the device with me at the office so that I could review with them step by step how to get the device to work. So I would have had to bring the device back into the office the next day and spend time during my workday trying to call them.

I was really getting into to it, I didn't want to put the book down, until the end. What a disappointing ending, it's as if Patricia Cornwell didn't know where she was going with the story so she decided to quickly throw an ending together. It didn't do the book justice!",

        "Title: Acoustic blues well done\nReview: Rory Block had done a number of CDs in her long career and most of them are straight acoustic blues with a little gospel thrown in. This is a typical effort. John Sebastian plays harmonica on \"Love My Blues Away\" and Block plays acoustic guitar and keyboards on all songs. Block also produced and sang lead and background vocals so this is her record even when she's doing someone else's song. Highlights include \"Swing Low\" and \"Just Like A Man\". If you are a fan of her other acoustic blues efforts, this is another typically good one to enjoy. 4.5 Stars\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

        "Title: Endearing and Humorous!\nReview: Mark Dunn's new book is the perfect antidote to winter chill. Curl up with it in front of a fireplace while a blizzard rages outside, and watch it warm your heart and cheer your soul. Set in a small town in the Bible Belt south, the book traces the lives of several characters, including a despondent minister, a sagacious masseuse, the local male heartthrob and several cultists, over a Labor Day weekend. Stereotypes quickly fade in the author's able hands, as he weaves a tale of his characters' endearing foibles and takes the plot round some unexpected twists and turns. There are some absolutely hilarious passages, written with a deadpan humor that had me laughing out loud in the middle of the night. The book is in many ways richer than the author's award-winning \"Ella Minnow Pea\", and demonstrates Dunn's extraordinary versatility as a writer - the subtext is more subtle, the humor more biting, the author's command of setting and tone more skilled. Well done!\nIs this product review negative?",

Personally I was disappointed in the story.I heard a review and thought it sounded like a great idea for a story. A guy on a train steals a woman's purse on a subway, not knowing that she's carrying microfilm which she's supposed to deliver to a Russian spy. Suddenly, this thief has the cops and the Russians looking for him.It sounded like a great idea, but the story was a huge disappointment to me. The characters were not very believable. For example, the woman who has her purse stolen, tracks down the thief and tries to get the film back. He punches her in the face and she falls in love with him.To me the story was very weak, which spoiled the movie. If you're interested in the movie for the technical stuff, you might enjoy it.

The problem happened when they went into production.This PDA has most of what \"mobile professionals\" need. Power, speed, connectivity....HP however, missed the boat on the quality dimension.My machine keeps turning on & off throughout the day and night until it runs out of juice. By the time I need it, the battey is almost dead.Synchronizing is another problem, Activesync 4.2 is much more unstable and limited than previous versions, thus loosing recently modified information or \"forcing you\" to create duplicate files in order to retain your changes. Before you know it, you have 3-4 documents for the same file. This isn't synchronizing anymore, this is...duplicating.Overall the product has more pros than cons, however these quality glitches does detract from the good job made by R&D.;This product isn't the HP quality product we became accustomed to, when in college !--Manny Rosillo",

When I opened the book and looked at the map it stated that if I wanted the trails in northern Colorado I would have to purchase the \"Guide to Northern Colorado Backroads\".

This may well be one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm not sure why, but I never get sick of it. I'm sure everyone knows by now that it's not supposed to be funny; it just is! The elaborate vegas dance numbers play out like a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit. The nudity and profanity in the movie are absurd and hysterical. Everything about this movie is so bad it's good. They could not have made it funnier if they had actually tried!! I LOVE it!\nAnswer:",

What's missing is a story. The main focus is on the efforts of some bums to do something nice for Doc, a kind but lonely marine biologist who was apparently based on Steinbeck himself, but the book meanders from that plot line through stories about a Chinese grocery man, a quasi-French painter, a slightly bats housewife, a madam and her suicidal pimp, among many others. The only thing they really have in common is where they take place. They are all largely boring. And then in the end, you do indeed wonder what the point was. THIS is a classic?",

Like in all her other novels Jane Austen describes with wit and style the life of a cute heroin. At that point Anne Elliot is slightely different, because she found her real love when she was a young woman, but she had to break her engagement, because the family matters wanted her to. After a few years she still loves the man she broke up with. As she meets him again a couple of years later, he has made a lot of money as Captain . At first they try to keep out of their way, but that seems to be impossible. They meet eachother really often, because the relatives of Anne want him to mary one of their daughters. The love is still there , in both of them, but manners and doubts make it impossible to tell.Like in all Jane Austen's novels there are implications and disaccords that let you always hope for a Happy End .And for my opinion Jane Austen wrote the most romantic loveletter in that book.\nAnswer:",

To proponents of this intellectual pose he says: \"...you cannot go on `explaining away' forever...You cannot go on `seeing through' things forever...To `see through' all things is the same as not to see.\" This book reinforced my basic instinct that the pessimistic nihilism of postmodernism (as well as Jewish post-Zionism) are wrong at some very fundamental level.

I temporarily tie it to the dumpster on the other side of the yard if we have guests; keeps from having to toss it when it is still useful.Be very careful when you dispose of this.

God's relationship with us isn't a simple thing sometimes, and the usual explanations just often won't do.I don't think you need to hold this to a standard of orthodox theology (which isn't its goal), but instead to a standard of whether it is a resource helpful for someone trying to come to terms with some of scripture's contradictions. I liked it a lot.",

As a Physical Therapist I work with people who have multiple medical conditions. Through Carol and Kimberly's clear, concise and safe format yoga is now accessible to those people who may not otherwise have the opportunity to practice. The alignment principles and techniques for changing position are invaluable. And the different options for seated, lying and standing classes allow the students to participate at their own level. I would definitely recommend it to my patients!Sharon Anoff, P.T.",

Susan Jane Gilman not only expertly draws the pictures, but reaches out a hand and pulls you into them. At times hilarious and at others so close to home that I feel the embarassment of being the \"different\" kid in school all over again, she hits the mark. I loved Kiss My Tiara, and like loving two kids (\"I don't love him more than you, I love you differently...) this one has found its own home in my heart.

        "Title: A Musical Masterpiece\nProduct review: Each Jars of Clay release is unique and full of creativity. The Eleventh Hour is no different. Many people compare the sound of this album to Jars Of Clay's self-titled debut, however the album uses more electric guitars than their previous releases. Don't worry, many of the songs still the acoustic Jars of Clay sound. The element of this album that truely stands out is the passion and emotion put into the lyrics. Example: Silence. The lead vocalist vocals are sang with incredible passion in a song about the doubts many face. Songs such as Fly and The Edge Of The Water also have great vocals. The Edge of The Water is the final track on the album which expresses the hope and longing of our savior's return. The album also features more upbeat rocker tunes like Revolution and Whatever She Wants. Overall this album is full of diverse well written songs with passionate singing of incredible lyrics. Well worth the money.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

There are many good singers that come out of the Idol shows - Kelly Clarkson has a soothing, big voice that gives me a shiver up my spine everytime; Will Young has an individual voice that really shines and impresses me; Tamaira Grey is not the best but still has an amazing voice; i think Guy Sebastian is also brilliant, so is Michelle McManus; and, of course, the new American Idol has - in the top twelve - at least six good singers: camile velasco & fantasia barrino are my favourites, and Diana, La Toya, George and Jennifer are also very impressive - but Aiken is not a breath of fresh air, his songs are all very camp and he thinks he's a unique man just because he's singing about love, but he is terrible. all the songs sound the same, and have way TOO much meaning, if you know what i mean.

It had an array of good, if not overly impressive, actors, good special effects, and a good basis novel. Unfortunately, the acting skips around from histrionics to casual acceptance where there should be histrionics to just plain silliness. This is a neat movie to watch for some brainless eye-candy, but it really lost a lot of energy in the translation from big-screen to video.And completely unrelated, but the ending scene sounds like an anti-Russian lobbyist. \"I won't let you kill any more children, Ukraine!

As a fan of Dumas or just a reader I would NOT recommend this book, instead go and get the 1000-1100 page version, idk if they make it in a softcover though, but that edition is EPIC.This is like watching a movie in fastforward, you miss a ton of the most important vital conversations/scenes b/c you're only skipping through for the action, and then just as you're about to get interested it'll end.Great for highschool book reports terrible for people that actually enjoy reading.\nIs this product review negative?",

        "Title: Disappointing\nProduct review: I am a huge Archer fan, and have read most of his works. Kane & Abel was very nice, but this second installment of the series was several notches below. Almost 50% of the book is a recap of the first book (though things are narrated from Florentyna's views, but a rehash nonetheless). The second half of the book is too procedural, in the sense that anyone not knowing the American election system will be absolutely lost and bored. The second half is a little too descriptive of the electoral processes, and even otherwise there is really nothing much to the plot. Planning to now read 'Shall we tell the President'..... hope that turns out to the usual Archer affair.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Jessica Biel was almost convincing as the sad little promiscuous girl looking for love and affection through sex, but who cares, since that character is totally overdone? Shannyn Sossamon, as gorgeous as she is, cannot save this trite exercise in banality. There is an uncomfortable scene in which she is vomited on while losing her virginity, but it seemed gratuitous. The best scene is when one of the kids (can't recall the name) makes an excellent scene in a restaurant.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

Cornell proved to be one of the decade's premiere songwriters and I expected so much more from this release. The music wasn't as ambitious as I had anticipated and some great lyrics were done in by suspect music. No song on here lives up to his earlier solo songs, nor do they have the inventiveness of his Temple of the Dog songs.

It arrives with three different methods for hanging: 1) available stud (nails are supplied) 2) no stud but dry wall (screw anchors supplied) 3) plaster (different set of anchors supplied). There is also a template that can be cut out so that the precise areas for the screws can be marked prior to hanging. You will require a drill and bit, of course. You can also order a metal attachment so that you can just hang the device over a door. The instructions are exacting and warns you to make room for other items in the room that might interfere with its function and they even provide the optimum length from the floor to hang the device. It works like a charm and holds plenty of weight. Great for when I bring home that large bundle of clothes from the valet or when I am packing for a trip or for my guests to hang their coats, etc. A great idea, well designed and solidly constructed.\nIs this product review negative?",

Additionally, a lot of work is spent on relaxation technigues, coupled with manipulating the way you think about things (called framing in the book). Basically the author encourages one to 'get over it'. There are some slick new acronyms such as PWS (the person who stutters!!!) but come on...no advancement.I'd encourage interested readers to check out the Valsalva techniques found in other books such as by William Parry.

Damon's sleazy, cheating character contrasts well with Diaz.Too much has been made of the 'Hair Gel' scene. It is rather juvenile but the film should be judged in it's entirety and not on one scene in dubious taste.Diaz looks like she genuinely enjoyed making this movie as the viewer feels that she wants to join the audience and burst out laughing. It is with Damon though that the real funny moments of the movie lie. The scene with the dog is hilarious and who could forget Damon's and Diaz first meeting where he informs her ..'I look after retards....Isn't that politically incorrect...yeah maybe, but I don't care,I'll look after who I want..\"Recommended for those who enjoy a good laugh\nAnswer:",

The voice over adds a great deal of understanding that it is needed for a better grasp of the motives of the characters. The so called \"phony ending\" is a definite absolute requirement for psychological resolution and hope. This release at least should had offered both versions.

Written in deceptively simple style and from the point of view of Rueven, a teen-aged Jewish boy in WWII era New York City, \"The Chosen\" is the story of his unlikely friendship with Danny, the son of a leader of Hasidic Jews in Williamsburg.Inextricably woven through the narrative is the study of the Talmud, which in terms of time and attention, is the center of both boys' lives.The two boys must work out their relationships among themselves and their fathers, and must find a way to pursue theircallings. Ironically, Danny's vocation is to become a \"secular\" psychologist rather than, as tradition dictates, a rabbi in thefootsteps of his father. Rueven is the one who senses a call to the rabbinate.Potok writes cleanly, never letting his style get in the way of the story. At its close you will know the hearts of its four major characters.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

I wish the company had provided the locations of the hanger loops, and that they were adjustable. My windows have steel frames and drilling new holes requires a powerful drill with a special bit, and paying someone to come and do it. So I threaded heavyweight paper clips through the blind where the hooks are already in the window and the blind is hanging from those. I would give the measurements here, but you can order the exact size blind you want (a plus) so my measurements would not mean much.The blind itself is just OK, a little more see-through than the one I had before, and a lighter color than I expected. The cord broke on the old one and I regret giving it away, because it was a better quality than this one, and cords can be replaced from a hardware store.Not the happiest purchase.",

It doesn't raise the laptop up enough to allow any significant air flow, to actually make the fans worth the battery consumption (which wasn't too bad). The two rubber feet on the top edge that raise your laptop up will melt onto the case, and leave black marks. The little dongle switch falls apart, constantly, and you have to push it back together. And WHY is everyone making chill pads out of PLASTIC??? It's called aluminum! Use it!I had this for about 3 months before it stopped working. You cannot set your laptop on your lap while using this, it doesn't even come close to covering the bottom of my laptop, and the fans are laughably weak.

The 4 stars are for the special effects, which far outweigh the story, or lack thereof. The skeletons chasing the double-decker bus were excellent, as were the dog-warriors, and although I thought they were quite silly as a plot device, the pygmies were nicely done. My gripes: the storyline was weak (I'm still trying to remember the point, but this gripe is well covered in other reviews), the kid was a typical precocious movie brat, the entire air balloon segment was wholly unnecessary, and the Scorpion King effect at the end was just awful (what, did they run out of special effects money by the time they got to the end?). I did like the past-life-visiting-the-present-life aspect of the story, though, as well as the perfectly nasty villainess.

Edward Dusinbere's lead violin especially left me transfixed by the nuance of his playing.Such artisty is heard on this landmark recording of Beethoven's revolutionary Op. 59/74 quartets which rated a Gramophone \"Gem\" award along with their sister recording of the late quartets. Behold some of the finest quartet playing on disc - modern or historic. Compositions - 5 stars; Performances - 5 stars; Sound quality - 4.5 stars.Another budget set to consider is Alban Berg Quartet on EMI which I deeply appreciate for its silky tone and highly polished ensemble.

'Petra' if you can even still call them that, have been reduced to a money-grabbing, commercial machine that would sing Marilyn Manson songs if they thought the public would buy it. This albumn is a gutless, shamefull, talentless, waste of time and energy that fails miserably. Schlitt ought to be fired and ashamed. NEWS FLASH JOHN: You can't compete with GREG VOLZ.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

Here, Praire Wind consists of lyrics a 10-year old would write for a school project. Nothing like Neil Young is capable of, and despite the hype that this album has, eventually Praire Wind will settle as one of his worst efforts.Why the album has such hype I can't say. But my guess is that at first blush many of Neil's songs sound the same. And it isn't till multiple listens that the wheat is separated from the chaffe. So, even though Prairie Wind may sound like a classic at first to reviewers, it isn't.\nAnswer:",

        "Based on this review, would the user recommend this product?\n===\nReview: Now Mick Jagger takes a swipe at the Presedent and conservatives in general with \"Sweet Neo-Con\". If anyone needs proof that drugs kill brain cells, they only need to look at all these Rock stars trying to be political scientists. The Rolling Stones should stick to writing songs about cheap sex, boos and partying. anything deeper than that could risk the loss of thier few remaining brain cells. Of course, the president and the conservatives needent be offended. Criticism from a bunch of old brain dead, stoner geezers should be taken as a compliment.after all, advice about character should come from one who actually has some. Womanizing stoners and boozers don't generally make the best judges on such matters. Advice to Mick: leave the political commentary to the professionals. Stick to the subjects you actually know: Getting laid and getting wasted.\nAnswer:",

In fact, many of his cited sources actually said the OPPOSITE of what Lomborg suggested in this book.[...]For those interested in detailed proof of Lomborg's deliberate fraud, watch for Yale U.

        "Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review?\n===\nTitle: Very Nice Overall\nReview: I think the version I have is a newer version than the one in the picture online. My version plays different types of music and it has several other sounds, such as raindrops, ocean sounds, etc. The music it does play is very pretty. The lights come and go and move throughout the toy very gently. I don't like to leave a night light on for my baby, so I just turn this on, and by the time the lights go off, my baby is asleep and I don't have to go back ant turn off lights. She's only 4 months old, so she doesn't play with it yet, so I can't comment on that. She does sometimes kick the button to make it go on, and it's very easy for her to do. I'd have given it 5 stars if it had the option of having just the lights with no music, so I could just turn on a CD.\nAnswer:",

Ok so its not the great literary masterpiece of the 20th century but its such easy reading and its so well done. It reads like a movie, a really good romantic comedy. Its laugh out loud funny and is an escape from the realities of life for a few hours. I always read this when i'm in a bad mood. It never fails to cheer me up and make me laugh. My favourite Jill Mansell, though its not the first one I've read. In essence this is good stuff.",
