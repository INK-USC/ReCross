This book basically talked about how Kenyatta got started, the dedication to his \"missus\", his crew, etc. I'm starting to get bored reading these books. Before I said I would read all of his book but this is the sixth one I've read and I've only liked two. It's like the same character on a different day: they all have prostitutes, young girls with pert breasts, pimps, and drugs. Blah blah blah. But what's really starting to bug me is that they all look like the same character, they're either fat and smell bad or tall, brown-skinned, with a bald head. And the author keeps reminding me every other page. I get it. I get it.\nIs this product review negative?",

The music is bland, the lyrics are insincere romantic tragedy at it's worse...and of course this one might become popular in say, Europe...but then again, \"Let's Dance\" was an immensely popular album that shared in the lack of same substance \"Hours\" does. There are moments of brillaince throughout the CD, but they sound more like \"planned accidents\" than anything else. The final track, \"The Dreamers\" does leave one with hope though...hence, two stars. Save your money and start a savings account at bowiebanc.com...you'll probably get more of interest there.",

Anne the romantic goes to the battlefield chasing Gilbert, gets roped in as a spy (a naive, incompetent one, don't get caught drinking Anne-nun) and has some \"McGyver\" moments.

It looks like a made for TV movie that was probably shown on the SCIFI channel. It has a heavy mix of CGI and live shots, most likely to keep costs down.But, the bottom line for me is that it's simply not interesting. It's a low budget film with flat uninteresting characters that relies heavily on cheap CGI to establish set placement. The funny thing is that if I saw this playing on TV I would change the channel because of the low budget production. So, why in the world would I want it in my DVD collection...This is a perfect example of a low budget movie that is bad, and don't get me wrong, I like low budget films.

Madonna and Rosie made a great team together. Hanks and Davis? What can you say. Just goes to show that you don't need a great script, just a great cast. The greatest line.... I'ts supposed to be hard. If it wasn't hard everyone would do it. A movie for anytime!\nIs the review positive or negative?",

        "Title: disappointed....\nReview: This is the 2nd time I have purchased this item - I loved my 1st one. It was a great holster; I only replaced it because the elastic siding was wearing out & making my blackberry slide out much too easily. I dropped it on several occasions because it would slide out of the case. But it took it over 2 years of daily wear to get to that point - so I considered it a really good product & ordered another one. This time the price was about a third of what I had initially paid. Unfortunately - the quality is definitely sub-par. After less than 3 months, the clip feels loose & the inside covering is peeling apart in 2 places and exposing my blackberry to a gummy residue. At the price - it's not worth sending it back. I would have rather paid more & gotten a quality product like I did the first time. I can't help but wonder if this is just a lemon or is it counterfeit?\nIs this product review negative?",

Many of the themes are common to other spiritual traditions (e.g. breaking routines, becoming inaccessible, not doing, or stopping the world--in the language of this book) and because of this, the reader may have a clue as to what Don Juan is getting at. However, Don Juan consistently spurns Castaneda when he asks for explanations, insisting on showing him instead. Unfortunately, the demonstrations seem to be pointless and nonsensical. Maybe, that's the point, but it gets tiresome to endure this over and over again throughout the book. I'm a big fan of psychedelic drugs and solipsistic thinking, and I approached this book with a great amount of focus but finished it mostly disappointed.\nAnswer:",

Coppola has SPLIT the film into two halves, \"Part One\" of the '79 and '01 versions being on the first disc, and \"Part Two\" on the other. This cutting of the film completely ruins the dramatic momentum of either version. It must be noted that this cutting of the film was not referred to in promotional materials; one only discovers this after purchasing the reissue.

It was short and straight-forward.\nIs this product review negative?",

However, the rest of the material on this disc is not quite as great as the stuff on the first and third volumes of Anderson's recordings on the Bluesville label. That is the sole reason I'm giving this disc four stars, and not five. Pink's few recordings with Simmie Dooley from the heyday of Country Blues are fantastic, and one should definitely seek them out. Listen to Frank Stokes' \"I Got Mine\" and then Pink's version. They are quite different, but both are highly memorable.",

Nah!!!\nReview: I realise I am voicing a minority opinion here but I just did not enjoy Gladiator. For me, it was an ok movie and nothing more. It certainly does not compare favourably to classic Roman epics like Spartacus and Quo Vadis. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre at best. I certainly did not feel any sympathy for Maximus in his time of sorrow. Derek Jacobi's senator was a waste of screen time. Commodus came off as a whiny cowardly brat.The best movie of 2000 was Titus. The acting was first class , the directing superb and the movie had a dialogue from a true master, William Shakespeare. Too bad the academy did not agree with me.",

The graphics are good but not great, the missions are fun unlike wreckless, you get to use a varity of weapons as you progress through the game, but what bothers me is that you can redo a mission over and over again completing sub missions untill you beat it. You should have to do it all in one to make it more challenging. When you shoot foot troops they break like playdo which gets very annoying after a while. Not to mention that you can transform to different vehicles such as a boat a motorcycle and more.

When I received the calipers the quality was even worse than I was expecting. Many of the measurement surfaces were rough machined with poor surface finish and flatness. The tolerances were so loose you easily move the measuring surfaces out of parallel and even out of allignment with each other. The sliding action was very jerky and prone to binding. Any one of these issues would cause a problem with accuracy and repeatability - together they make the calipers worthless to me. Furthermore, none of the machined edges were broken (polished) so there were some very sharp edges that would most likely cut your hands as you use the calipers.When I decided to purchase this caliper I figured even if they were poorly made I would keep them as a backup. When I saw how badly they were made I decided to return them for a refund.",

Arriving alone, naked and friendless, \"A Princess of Mars\" tells the tale of how John Carter, with the aid of his earthly strength and agility, sets forth on an incredible adventure against enormous odds to rescue the beautiful Dejah Thoris, the incomparable Princess of Helium.One of Edgar Rice Burrough's earliest works, the first chapter in the Martian series is also one of his finest.

It is highly subjective and very critical of Princess Diana. The rest of the royal family members come under scrutiny, but Diana fairs the worst. It is more than obvious that the author favors the queen and the Prince of Wales, especially the prince. The author lavishes praise on Kate Middleton and hopes that Middleton and Prince William will settle down and live happily ever after and bring credibility and respectability to the monarchy. Give me a break! I found the book to be tactless and devoid of any substance.",

It has a great cast (I was surprised to see a few actors) and some actual footage of the War of the Pacific. The storyline was a bit slow for me and I wish they put in the scenes that were for the T.V. version. All in all a great film to remind us of the world's most devastating war.",

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product?\nReview title: Well-done epic Western\nProduct review: I cannot attest to the film's complete authenticity, but it starts out telling an often told tale. Young Wyatt Earp tried at least 4 times--beginning at the age of 13--to run away from home and join the Union Army. In the film Gene Hackman, playing his father, stops him and sends him back home. This scene and the one following where Virgil and James Earp return from the War are two of the most compelling in the film.The remainder of the two-disk film closes with Wyatt much older having survived the Western frontier and moving on to Alaska. It's a hopeful ending and a beautifully filmed one, too.The other aspect of this film I liked best was James Newton Howard's soundtrack. The ex-Toto musician can really bring life to a scene and more often than not when I have enjoyed a soundtrack, I've found James Newton Howard was somehow involved in the effort.",

        "Title: INTERESTING WHAT IF NOVEL\nReview: What if the third secret of the miracle of Fatima would upset the Catholic Church as we know it? That is the premise of Steve Berry's take on Vatican politics, papal infallacy and faith itself. Some Catholics may take much offense at the way the pope and the cardinals are portrayed, as truly there are some evil ones in this book. There is blackmail, murder, lies and deception and the overall portrait of the church is certainly not a pretty one. Father Colin Michener, who is secretary to Pope Clement XIV is sent on a mysterious mission to uncover the facts behind Marian visitations. He is joined by an old lover, an atheist reporter named Katherine Lew, and finds himself in danger at every turn. Much information is given on the miracle at Fatima and the mechanism behind the election of a new Pope. The writing is good and the plot holds your interest. Issues of celibacy, homosexuality, abortion are all addressed. A thought provoking if somewhat disturbing read.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

I turned it on and instantly found I was completely wrong. The visuals were the first things i noticed. Instead of predictable sweeping cameras and profile shots, the cinematics were very original and captivating. The cinematography matched the intensity and setting of the band: When the opening number started, the music pounded and the visuals become so jumpy I just got lost and faded into the music. The audio is in DTS 5.1 and is equaly as good as the visuals. It doesnt sound like your at the concert; it sounds better. The music covers you, but unlike other 5.1 music dvds, the sound is stationary - none of the sounds jump around. This creates a more consistant sound, and is excellent to just sit down, relax and completely fade right into the music.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

Offred's struggle and willingness to survive without an identity, but two ovaries and a womb, will open the reader's eyes to the changing roles of women in society.\nAnswer:",

Nearly every song just feels honest and real; as usual, Free dips deeper into his emotions than most rappers in his genre and pulls more out as a result to show for it. Suga Free's relentless enthusiasm for the lifestyle he leads is well-known in Southern California, and it and his sense of humor about it come across on every song. If some of the tracks on the album feel inconsistent, it's probably more because the singles - \"U Know My Name\" and \"So Fly\" (featuring Snoop Dogg) - are just so catchy by comparison that it leaves the listener wanting more. \"The Ranger\" is also amazing, featuring a backing beat with (of all things) an *alternative rock* melody as backing. It's great!On the whole, a witty, wonderful effort. Play on, playa!",

It is not suspenseful at all, and it is remotely entertaining. Other than that it is pretty boring and overall plotless. The ending was dumb, the opening was slow, and how somebody could walk out of the theatre in a \"state of shock\" after seeing this poorly done film.However, there were a few points that I found entertaining. Such as the pursuit scene through the woods, and at least Leatherface rakes in the bodies here. Hammers, chainsaw, hooks, etc. All that stuff is here but it wasn't the gothic, dark, dirty, creepy bloodfest that the new one was.The new one was far more entertaining and suspenseful, not to mention Leatherface was much scarier looking. I mean, in the this one (original) you do not know that his mask is made of skin, but at least you figure out that they're cannibals.All in all, I give the original TCM about a 2.5.

Lets put it this way her small scene in the beging is really the only scene worth watching. I think Christopher Lambart is a first class actor the story is wonderful and so is the sets and music. The audience has to almost help make the story because it seems like the movie is either in future of in the past its hard to say, the movie is based on a 18th century poem and the way people dress and the way they live seems to be from the past but then there is the little thing of having zippers, lighters, and so on and so. I don't understand either that only one person in the movie has an english accent shouldn't they all? In all i found the movie hard to understand you have to watch it a couple of times and read allot about it on the internet to undertstand it.\nAnswer:",

King is an excellent author, but his books do not translate to film very well.The Dead Zone is a prime example of a great book that made a boring movie. There isn't enough character development to make you care what's going on. This is one case where they should have focused on one aspect of the book and left the rest out.Christopher Walken is the one reedeming factor in this movie. There is one scene where Walken gets angry and you catch a preview of some of his future roles. If you're a Christopher Walken fan then that one scene is worth the price of the DVD.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

Frank Baum is an absolutely terrific writer. I've read this book so many times (I don't know the number) and I still like it. It's just too good to read just once. I recommend it highly! Anyway, it's about a girl named Dorothy from the great Kansas prairies. One afternoon (or earlier than that), her house (with her inside it) is blown to the Land of Oz by a sudden cyclone. There, she finds strange people and surroundings. Strangely, all the people think she is a sorceress. She also meets the Witch of the North, who tells her to go to the Emerald City in the center of the city to ask Oz, the terrible wizard, to help her get back to Kansas (which is what she wants than to stay in Oz). She listens, and goes off on the Yellow Brick Road that leads to the Emerald City. What else happens? Find out by reading the book!\nAnswer:",

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product?\nReview title: brilliant classic novel\nProduct review: This novel, written by the great existentialist Albert Camus, is one of the greatest novels that I have ever read. It is far better than even The Stranger, also by Camus, or even Graham Greene's The Heart of the Matter. It is the story of a cluster of characters, each in his own way quite well developed. Of course, the physician stands out as the main protagonist. They reside in a city that is quarantined to prevent the spread of a plague that, while tragic in its own right, brings the characters to new self-understanding and leads each to new behavioral highs or lows. It is great reading, it is not too long so it can be read in a day or so, and it is sure to offer the reader many opportunities for self-examination (which, I found, takes longer than reading the book). I give this an A+ and it is among the works that I most highly recommend!",

However, I was a little disappointed by the apparent lack of effort that went into the finished product. With such a comprehensive assortment of music, I expected to find at least liner notes or a booklet with some biographical material or reviews. Also, it should be noted that the final disk in this set is only spoken word. While the novelty of it is awesome, and you get to here Lightnin's stories first hand, at my first listening I was somewhat off set because I wasn't expecting it.

The moment he lifted up the corrupt Flass and told him 'Swear to me!', Batman was back and bigger & badder than ever. Nolan became my hero ever since. He is truly a master at his craft.

If you don't like that, then don't read it. I am currently showing my younger sibling the different religous ways, and silver ravenwolf was one of the things I showed them. Part of our religion is to believe everyone has a right to their beliefs, how can you say she is wrong?\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

After the initial 'Anne' books, a sequel was squeezed in between this book and \"Anne's House of Dreams\". I think LMM was under pressure to write sequels, so after this the books are either average or poor, excepting \"Rilla of Ingleside\". In this book, Anne is more mature. She leaves Prince Edward and heads to Redmond college. There, tension arises between her and Gilbert--one wants friendship, the other love. Anne is getting a taste of living truly independent, away from home, but she has wonderfully amusing new friends to help her. Love, humor, and drama make this a very satisfying book indeed.",

This is different than the movie, so don't expect a word-for-word printed version of the movie. The book does do a better job of fleshing out the characters.The book starts with an introduction meant to lead the reader into thinking this is an abridged version of the childhood story the author heard from his father. The book is full of parts that have been \"cut\" from the story for our reading enjoyment. It can sometimes get a little confusing to keep straight, and occasionally the extra bits can distract from the flow of the story, but overall, the whole package makes for a very fun and entertaining read.\nAnswer:",

I'm lucky enough to number some of Hawaii's legendary guitarists as good friends - but this album is unique.It rightly prioritizes guitar pyrotechnics (yes, even slack key has its technicians) for lush and lovely melodies that blend Hawaii and the West, in a deeply emotional but spare technique that accentuates rather than dulls the gorgeous simplicity.A landmark album that may mark a vibrant new era in an increasingly cluttered slack key pantheon. (Are the traditionalists listening?)

But, just like an accident or police car chase, you have to watch. Overall, the movie was just too sappy. And every \"twist\" is not surprising. Also, I don't understand why the movie switched between color and black-and-white -- I'm guessing the decision was made in a very late editing session because it didn't seem to have any context. In conclusion, I thought the bar scenes were the best...I can't believe I'm agreeing with the guys. I encourage you to check your cable listings if you're curious about this movie and spend your money on something better.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

For one thing, the babies' mouths DO NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT move in sync with what they are saying. A couple of times, the adult actors' voices do not go with what they are saying, either. This was a major annoyance in the movie. It would not have been so bad if they just had the babies do their actions and have voice-overs without their lips moving (like Homeward Bound, a 5-star movie). But no, the movie is ruined.

        "Title: Tough to Hear\nReview: My husband is on his third RAZR phone--the first one just stopped working after a while and the second died about a day after the warranty expired. The replacement was not free and required a contract extension. It's nice looking, small functions reasonably intuitively, and the bluetooth earpiece is nice, but it's a pretty fussy little thing. When I use it, I find I can't hear the caller it unless I have it positioned at just the right angle to my ear and I spend half the conversation looking for that sweet spot and asking people to repeat things. Also, some of the screen pixels seem to go sort of semi dead so that they look a bit greyed out at certain angles.

Beautiful sexy women turned on by blood and gore. Sex, rape, murder, torture, cannibalism all glorified like these are the best ideas a person can have to make their life more meaningful.It should have been rated X, and the commercial should let you know how much nudity, blood, gore, sex, and violence is in the movie, instead of showing it as if it were artsy and clever.There is no story, or very little story. If it weren't for the constant violence the movie would be nothing but black and white boring depressive scenes.

I read from cover to cover almost in one sitting.BLACK NOTICE, and it's predecessor, POINT OF ORIGIN were books that got shuffled to the back of the bookshelf for when I didn't have anything else to read. It appears that Cornwell is moving away from the stand-alone novel and moving into the area of novel-in-serial, where in order to understand one you must read the earlier works. Some of the twists and turns will be explained in the later book, LAST PRECINCT, if you can hang on for that long of a journey.Scarpetta still solves her crimes but she appears to be doing it while whining and complaining.

The hero Torka and his mate Lonit have such a tender relationship, and their discovery of an orphan adds greater warmth to the story. The primitive struggle to survive is what fuels the story, but love and courage is what pushes them forward to a new land and a new way of life.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

This film has neither, it's just a somewhat boring not very good British genre horror pic.

That is why on this DVD you need to understand how to get the hidden features. For example there are 4 different version of \"New Moon on Monday\" on the video.My recommendation would be that you go to http://www.duranduran.com and go to the ASK KATY section and look for the info about the \"Easter Eggs\". If you can't find it there, then you should go into the Message Boards and search under the topics and search for \"Greatest DVD\".There are more videos that I would have liked to have seen on the video but I realize that there is a limit.

In many ways, Christine was sort of a teenage 'everywoman' thrust into a horrifying and non-sensical world during the siege of Budapest in WWII. I can't imagine going out onto the street because someone has found a dead horse on the road, and needing to act quickly in order to carve up the meat to bring home. I remember her aching crush on the young soldier, Pista. I remember how things suddenly seemed to look better and then one of their neighbors was almost casually gunned down, after having survived so long in their brutal world. Perhaps it was simply that I was the same age as Christine when I read her book, but I have never forgotten this story.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

My dog has mange and two luxating patellas. I wrote her to warn her of the genetic problems with her breeding stock, and to tell her that otherwise I adore my dog. What I got back from her were angry, ignorant replies where she accuses me of trying to get a free dog from her. I told her that a \"free\" dog from her would definatly not be \"free\". Please do not support this woman, and by all means, do NOT buy a dog from her! If you'd like to see the email transcript- see my puppy's blog at Myspace-- user name is weasagail . For what it is worth, her book has nice pictures of rat terriers, but thats about it (as other reviewers have described much better).

It just seemed a little rushed at times, but the scares were there and they did not disappoint.

I read it over and over again the first time I checked it out from the library, and decided it had to be part of my kid's permanent collection. The book starts off with \"My favorite person is coming to visit me today...\" and goes on to take you through a story of two people sharing time together and enjoying the simple things in life, like hot chocolate \"with as many marshmallows as you want\". It teaches that part of love is sharing small things in common together, and you're never too old to enjoy the company of a little person if you don't lose touch with the kid inside yourself.",

Being a couple year long fan of Flashlight Brown, listening to the downloads from the site (never able to find a CD!), one can hear the changes that the band itself has gone through. Their new rendition of 'Lose the Shades' is a work of genius, and the same goes for 'Butterball.' New songs, including 'Praise the Day,' 'Go and Die,' and 'I'll Only Make You Cry' (my favourites) are amazing songs. Anyone who loves upbeat, good punkish rock should definantly get this CD!!\nAnswer:",

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied?\nTitle: A little dissapointing...\nReview: 3001 would probably have been allright as a stand-alone, but it read like Clarke didn't really have anything left to say about the monoliths. All through the book, I was thinking, \"OK, this is all interesting: all the future predictions and gadgets, but when do we get to the monolith?!?\" I really got interested when they discovered the monolith's plans, but nothing ever came of it. They had ONE meeting about it where they figured out how to solve the issue (trying not to give anything away to anyone who hasn't read it), Frank had ONE conversation with Dave and they implemented their solution. I thought the humans were going to get into a real good conflict with the monolith, but instead all I got was that weak spectacle at the end when the monolith was defeated. So basically, interesting view of the future, but Clarke seemed to be trying too hard to fit it into the 2001 series.",

Don't waste your time with this poorly designed and cheaply made tool.Pro: Seems to be accurate when it works.Cons:- Throw the case away immediately. It'll hit your \"on\" button and run down your battery.- It doesn't take much for it to stop working. Flashing random numbers, according to the manual, means the battery is getting low. Well it must get low pretty quickly. On the 2nd battery it lasted 3 weeks, with zero use.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

In fact, I remember reading about the feud that ensued between Jack Nicholson and screenwriter Robert Towne over the production of this movie.

When bands start doing covers of Deringer's rock N roll hoochie coo it's either a lack of new materiel or a shift in direction. Me thinks this is Blaine's Dixie fried influences coming through! Thought the pussy intro was a bit juvenile too. All that being said, most of the album still kicks butt! Like all previous comments, they were a blast to see live - - my ears whined for days thanks to a front row pearch in front of rock goddess Ruyter and her Marshall stack.

C.S. Lewis mixes classical Greek elements drawn directly from the myth with an almost tribal sense of spirituality and a fairy-tale setting to tell a wonderfully unique and thought-provoking story from the point of view of Psyche's sister.We feel firsthand the heartbreak and intensity of first love, family love, betrayal, and loneliness. This story draws fewer allegories than Lewis' other fiction (Narnia, Out of Silent Planet trilogy, Screwtape) and instead is a powerful story from a wonderful storyteller which is much more subtle in its morals and questions of life.

The definitive telling of the Manson murders.\nReview: \"Helter Skelter\" is the first and only book I have ever read regarding Charles Manson and his followers, and after having finished it, I can't imagine ever needing to read another. Bugliosi goes over the Tate/LaBianca crimes in minute detail, and even covers earlier murders committed by Manson and the family that most people might not know about. Even though the basic details of the story and the outcome of the trials are already known, Bugliosi's telling is enthralling and at times I had difficulty in putting the book down. Highly recommended.",

        "Title: Well written and kinda true!!!\nReview: This book had a lot of truth to it. A lot of us women take our issues to our hair, and it is not an ethnic thing. Tyson Edwards, the egocentric character, had it pinned just right. However, I was a little miffed that Venus Johnston, who had it going on in every other respect, had to feel that she needed to do something drastic to bring distinction to herself. I really don't think cutting her hair was going to have much of an impact like she thought it would. I understood her plight with Clint Fairchild, but rushing him wasn't going to make it happen any better or sooner. The character I really felt sorry for was Kandi, she was in a no good triangle with one man and then got involved as the rebound with another. She was the one that should have cut her hair off. Trisha Thomas did a dynamite job with bringing this to full circle for us and showing that a woman doesn't have to rely on her vanity to make it in life.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

This would be the \"Dream Concert\" to attend if it was at all possible. The smoky voices of Ella, Sarah, and Helen Merrill carry you away and get you lost in the music.I highly recommend this because if you are a Jazz-lover, then you need this so that you can have something to play for yourself and for your friends.

Since then I've read a few more of his novels and haven't been so impressed. I almost gave up hope that perhaps Tau Zero was his only great work... until I came across The Star Fox.A fantastic Poul novel! Early space opera- short and sweet. Hesitant earth lets a colony fall to conniving aliens. The main character Heim says, \"Oh oh... hell no! Not while I'm alive! I'm gonna go mess 'em up.\" And does so. Chapters 1 and 3 are pretty much part of a linear story and would have been a 5-star read if it hadn't been for the second chapter, which is out of place. Chapter 2 by itself though would have been a good story. However, it turned itself into a superfluous bridge. Overall, fantastic planets, plotting and people.",

It is 275 pages, but the information could be printed in half that if weren't all double-spaced and in large type. It is also cheaply printed--the titles seem to use a drop shadow effect that might have looked good on-screen, but looks more like a bug when printed.Only basic command-prompt stuff is presented. I don't see anything about file name completion, for example, and newer tools like fc (File Compare) are not included.There are six pages on scheduling tasks with the \"at\" command, but it never mentions the newer XP command, schtasks, which is better integrated with the GUI version.Finally, there is no index in the book. There is a chapter that has commands sorted by function rather than name, but it isn't a substitute for a real index.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

And I'm still laughing at the concept of a cat named Puppy!This book is a good entertaining read, but it's also full to the brim with useful, edifying subject matter, a perfect blend of romance, intrigue and good, solid Christian faith.

I am the son of Sam Salz who is mentioned in a short passage in the book as a legendary art dealer. I think Mr.Feigen's description of his method of dealing is accurate even though my father's german-jewish accent is slightly overdone. My father may have been a shrewd and sometimes ruthless negotiator but he always saught a good home for \"his pictures\" and could judge a great one from a \"postage stamp\". The rest of the book deals very well with the gradual takeover of large corporate interests in the museums.

I used Cartwright's book extensively while I was working on an undergraduate thesis project on Isabella d'Este's patronage. The main pitfall of the book-which is by far the most complete \"portrait\" of Isabella d'Este-is Cartwright's own sentimentality. She creates a true Edwardian heroine of the Renaissance, however, she provides enough epistilary evidence to allow the reader to interpret for herself what Isabella was like. I have read a few books on Isabella, and each of them use the Marchesa for their own purposes. Isabella's unique position as a patron of the arts makes her a frequent target of lavish praise and damnation. In Cartwright's book, the reader is allowed to see a more complete picture of Isabella, although much work still needs to be done on the Marchesa in order to really understand her and her milieu.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

I first saw it when I was very young (right after it came out) and it got to me just as much then as it does now.I will admit however that to a person who isn't into the UFO phenomena it might not make a lot of sense. Being very big into the paranormal myself (practically my whole life), I will say that it even took me a while to fully understand what was going on in this movie. Ultimately however at the end there isn't much that can or can't be proven as no one can really claim to know the full truth (at least that I know of :)).Altogether I give this a 4 out of 5 stars. If you're into the UFO phenomenon, you'll probably enjoy it.

I have been trying to find a copy of it to buy for years. I read this book several times in grammer school, (about 35 years ago) and I have never forgotten it. The story always touched me....a beautiful lady, who could have married into wealth and luxury, but instead chose true love. She lived to realize all her dreams through her children. The story never fails to bring tears to my eyes. I can't wait to receive my copy and read it again and again!!!",

This is reflected in the image quality as well. Audio is not even remastered for surround and is in 1 Channel MONO. I can't believe they would even release this on Blu-ray this way as it is seemingly no better than standard DVD or even VHS! I am very disappointed in the product. The movie is a great 80's Flick but I just wish that they had taken a little more care and time to release it the right way.... Do not buy if only upgrading from a previous medium.

I have absolutely nothing against a female lead having a love interest, but it seems quite obvious that the author is not only inexperienced but also uncomfortable when it comes to writing love scenes. Oh well... Romance sells, I suppose, even if it's poorly written. The only good thing about the clumsy description is that we are spared the \"insert tab A in slot B\" part.The only plausible - and hence best - part of the story was the plotline about the old bones in the church, and that took up maybe 50 pages of the book.",

Keanu Reeves is still his same self here, which means that he gives another boring acting turn. His fellow co-stars do far more in their parts with Rachel Weisz being the stand out, giving a great performance that has resonance and guts. Djimon Hounsou is good as well but he's barley in the film and Peter Stormare give a great cameo that really should have been a bigger role. Weisz, Hounsou and Stormare give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that, they are worthy of the praise (Especially Weisz, who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it's really is.) but regardless of their worthy acting turns, the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does not know how to direct a movie.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

        "Title: One of my favorite Hornblowers!\nReview: In my project of reading the HH books chronologically (according to Hornblower's age), I confess I bogged down in BEAT TO QUARTERS because it was too much Lady Barbara Lady Barbara Lady Barbara and Hornblower ragging (mentally) on poor, fat, blowsy, adoring wife Maria. Ugh. Thankfully, after a long hiatus, I picked up again with FLYING COLOURS. What a wonderful book! One of my favorite in the series, it chronicles Hornblower's adventures after losing the Sutherland and having to escape from France, where he is slated for execution. (And if you were one of those who enjoyed HH mooning after Lady Barbara and dissing his wife, there's more of that in this book. Whatever. I'm over it.)Love this series.

I try to give LTIP another chance every severalyears or so, hoping that something in me has changed or maturedso that I \"get it\" a bit better. Well, I haven't or can't. It still seems like an indulgent, boring mess. Yes, Brando can act.Yes, Maria Schneider has a fantastic 20-year old body. What does it all add up to? Nothing! A 2 hour waste of time. A movie with a totally emoty story and emotional core. I like a lot of stufffrom the late '60s and early '70s, but if sitting through tedium like this in the name of art was indicative of the era - thankGod we've moved on.

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied?\nTitle: A Brilliant album somewhere between Guero and Sea Change\nReview: I was not really sure how I would like this album after listening to both Geuro and Gerolito. The information has a sound very similar to actually 3 of his former CD's. Of course, Guero is the first one. The other is Sea Change, and the 3rd is Mutations, to some degree. My favorite cut is #10 on the CD. I forgot the title. I just love it. Soldier Jane is a good one too. There is a lot of value in the album. I think it is even better than mutations. Beck seems a little depressed on a couple of good songs too, but, sounds like he is going through a spiritual search or something. Beck just keeps evolving, however. Can't wait to watch the DVD the album came with. Next thing you know, Beck may be coming out with some old Standards with a trio. (From the 1940's).You never know what Beck will do next. Keep lovin' him.PeaceDirk-David Todd",

The cover and all writing is in Italian! The worst thing is that it will not play on the dvd player, or the x-box. It will play in the laptop. It says this dvd is only available for viewing in Italy and a bunch of other foreign countries nowhere near here. I ordered it from Utah, you would think they could send it here and it would play. I have never heard of such a thing. I can't send it back because it had to go back to Italy and I will not deal with that overseas mailing hassle. This has been a nightmare and I feel Amazon shouldn't work with 3rd parties like these people. I like to order from Amazon.

Instead of taking a break during the story and going to a commercial in between, Grisham has to fill up space. I don't know if it was because he had to fill up pages, or because it allows him to express his own politcial views (D), but Grisham goes all out. Readers can tell that he is trying to talk about Wal-Mart and what it does coming to town (as he sees it), and he uses Vietnam to point out his feelings on Iraq. It's not enough just to point these out, he has to include the editorials and speeches in the text.Why do we have to read through this? This was an interesting story, but it stretched far too long. Where was the editor when this manuscript came in? Did they just let him ramble because they know it will be a bestseller? Just stick with the story. I don't care how short it is. Maybe put two together if you have to. I enjoyed the personal impact ending, as opposed to the plot ending, which was a bit lame.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

Intended to be 'built', we thought it would encourage our son to use his imagination and be creative. Unfortunately, as soon as we snapped the pieces together, it fell apart before my son had a chance to enjoy it. It is a constant struggle to keep it 'together' and even with the slightest bump, it comes apart and causes frustration. He has totally lost interest because it doesn't stay together long enough for him to become involved in the whole adventure that is supposed to be inspired by such a toy. It has many neat features, and had it stayed together better, I would have given it 5 stars. I wish I had spent the extra money and bought the Playmobil, obviously the better choice.\nAnswer:",

It deals with many things beyond the seemingly straightforward plot - knowledge and power, duty and desire, destiny and will. Years of writing scientific papers affected the author's style - the language is precise and clear even when facing Unknown. The pace of the book is somewhat more relaxed than is typical for the genre but those extra words per unit of action are worth reading. The book is rather mild and kind in coping with harsh realities of life. Generally, fans of Conan the Barbarian saga will be disappointed; fans of J.R.R. Tolkien and G.G. Kay are likely to enjoy it.\nAnswer:",

        "Title: Not bad for a remake\nReview: I have never been much of a fan of remakes or sequels but I didn't think this one was so bad. It stars Tony Todd(Candyman) and has the same plot as the original. Maybe I'm partial to this one because it's done in color and I belive the special effects are better. The movie overall is creepy and wastes no time in getting to the good stuff. Of course in most horror movies there isn't much of a storyline but if you wanted a storyline you wouldn't be watching a horror flick. If you saw the original Night of the Living Dead I believe you should see this version as well and compare for yourself. I don't think you'll be disappointed.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

        "Title: Book 2 continues Tolkien's epic of rings and Hobbits.\nProduct review: I have read already The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Rings and I have one thing to say about The Two Towers, it is awesome. After the Fellpwship you know Gandalf is dead, the fellowship is probably going to be scattered, and Frodo is going with the faithful Samwise to Mordor alone. The Two Towers, like the first book, is split in to two sections. One is with Strider, Legolas, and Gimli to set out and find Merry and Pippim and deal with the treachory of Saruman(and on hint, there is a huge suprise in store). The second is all about Frodo and Sam on the trek to Mordor with the treachorous Gollum. At first he seems to be different and wants to be called his old name, Smeagol,but you quickly learn that Gollum has two sides(named by Sam as Slinker and Stinker). It all ends with a perfect setting for the next book, The Return of the King. All in all The Two Towers is one of the best books you'll ever read in your lifetime.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

        "Title: Very good, but not A Fine Balance\nReview: A very enjoyable book, full of irony, humor, and social commentary. It offers a picture of middle class life in contemporary India, commentary on the state of religious and ethnic relations there, and the stories of several interesting and well drawn characters. Although it deals with mundane people in rather ordinary circumstances, there were several parts of the book that made my heart race. It's a testament to the author's skill that he can make ordinary moments extraordinary (and it's striking that none of the most overtly dramatic moments are told in the present tense or fleshed out very much). Nonetheless, in my view, the book falls short of Mistry's spectacular A Fine Balance. It just doesn't have that book's scope or impact.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

So many people recommended this book, saying that they had delayed reading it because of the cheesy title, but it was wonderful. In a word, no.Sure, Laurens is the queen of the panting, highly explicit sex scene, but this book took even that to the point of ridiculousness. Not that that's too hard to do. My biggest beef with this book is that the strong, independent heroine became a total wimp every time the hero came near her. Their relationship was about sex not love; I can't see them making it as a lifetime couple. Jack always has to have the upper hand and Kit always gives in the moment he touches her.Silly.The first books in the Cynster series are Laurens' best -- you know, the ones before she starts getting repetitious.\nAnswer:",

As a horror buff, this is one of the worst films I've encountered. Scary? Nope. So bad it's good? Nope. Just plain bad. Why can't modern directors create mood anymore? While production values are strong -- with some fine camera work -- this mess isn't in the least bit involving. The priest is little more than a cameo, the ending is lame, and while I didn't expect the walls to run blood like in the original, there was nothing comparable. Worst part? Killing the dog.

Although Robert Lewis Stevenson wrote it in 1883, the classic is still in print and is appropriate for anyone in grades 5-8. The journey begins with no major problems, but when Jim and the rest of the crew approach their destination everyone on the ship gets their own idea of the way things are going to work. Throughout the story Jim Hawkins, the main character, takes risks for the well-being of himself and his colleagues. Finally, his shipmates lose faith in him but he prevails. The events that take place in this story are extremely exciting and surprising. This book is one of my favorites and should be read by all.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

I was going to get a digital SLR camera because I wanted a faster shooting speed, but after researching further I realized everthing I would give up. This is the best compromise between a compact and a larger SLR camera. I love the 10x zoom, it has a nice big LCD monitor to review pictures and position shots. I've become addicted to filming video clips of my kids and sending them to friends and family thru youtube. My only wish is that it could be faster when shooting multiple shots, but I think it is still better than most compacts. Also some pictures seem to come out a bit darker than I would like, but that might be the photographer. I'm a point and shoot kind of person.\nAnswer:",

I heard things, subtle nuances in instrumentation and vocals that I have never heard before ( I.E. \"I Am The Walrus\" ). I can't praise the sound quality enough.

Irresponsible and damaging to teens who are navigating through normal adolescent experiences. No good can come from the oppressed becoming the oppressor, bending all to their beliefs. Why can't a boy feel close or emotionally connected to another boy without being labeled as \"gay\" or \"bi-sexual?\" i.e., Isn't it possible that a teenage boy who likes fashion is just that: a teen-aged boy who likes fashion?

It may have started the slasher genre, but it's no \"Psycho\" or \"Halloween\". Those are the only two slasher films that are actually classics. \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" is just stupid ... None of the teenagers in this film are ones that you care about. By the last half of the film, I wanted Sally [Marilyn Burns] to be sawed because all she did was scream for a whole hour. The cannibals were more sickening and laugh-inducing than scary. For a better serial-killer film, go for \"Silence of the Lambs\" and \"Psycho\" of course. Those films are subtle and truly, deeply scary. \"TCM\" is over-the-top, grainy, crude, and masochistic.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

I enjoy Yo-Yo Ma as one of the finest cellists performing today, and have heard him live with Emmanuel Ax, and I usually go to a movie that has a John Williams score even if the story doesn't look like something I'd enjoy.

It took me a long time to get around to listening to it, due to my tendency to not value what's free. But now it's the only disc that has a permanent slot in my CD changer. This album is simply amazing. It's sensuous. It's eclectic, yet cohesive. At times it's troubling--Jelly Omelette comes to mind--but I always feel content at the end of it. Shades of trip-hop permeate it, but it's rather more than that. I lack the musical vocabulary to do it justice. Just pick it up. You'll be hooked.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

It also shows us that no matter which road we choose to take, in the end, we will end up exactly where or who we are supposed to be with.I first saw it when a friend recommended it to me several years ago and it stuck with me. Finally, 5 years later, I saw the DVD on-sale and bought it to watch it again. After finishing it, I thought about life again and all it's infinite possibilities of the what if's.I know it's a movie, but there are some parallel truth even to our universe. This movie is comedic, yet profound. Like Robert Frost's \"The Road Less Traveled\" - I chose the latter, and it has made all the difference.",

Its about a guy that comes back from the dead. His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place. The acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths.

Then recently it stopped working properly. The tool would give me the angle measurement, but not the miter, bevel or spring. I thought it might be the batteries, so I put new ones in. This did not solve the problem. It was the electronics in the tool it self. Every time I pressed the button to get these measurements the tool would display three dashes on the screen. So finally I decided to pack up the tool and send it to Bosch. It was still under warranty, but it was a hassle just the same. Bosch told me they could not fix it and would send me a new one, fine. I finally get the tool back and want to use it to finish my project, press the button to get the miter angle and again it is doing the same thing as before, what a lousy tool. This tool was not cheap, and I expect it to work when I need it to. I thought Bosch was known for quality, now the only thing I think they stand for is unreliability and aggravation. Buyer beware!",

My husband encouraged me to give it a try since there is a life time warranty. It has been a couple of months now and I really do love the pans. It does take some getting used to but they cook so much better. Be sure to let the pans heat up before adding oil and everything is great. I did purchase the 5 1/2 quart saute pan as well. I use it more than anything. The only negative I see is that the pans are heavy. They are not as easy to handle when putting food into another bowl or platter. The size of this set along with the 5 1/2 quart was perfect for cooking for our family of four.",

She's not a pop princess. She's not thin and blonde, or blessed with a big voice. But what she does have is a thrilling sense of style, and a strange charisma. SLEEPING IN THE NOTHING is simply a New Wave dance record, but it works. Linda Perry's production and song writing works well, and Kelly brings the right attitude to make me a believer. None of it is very deep, but I've found it a total guilty pleasure. \"Red Light\", \"Suburbia\", and \"One Word\" all work like gangbusters (if you're downloading those are the three to get!). It's all a fun listen! I doubt anyone involved with the CD wanted it to be anything more than a good time and easy to listen to. Mission accomplished.

It would be nice if it had little pockets on the side so you could shovel sand into it. For an infant and beach use, not the best purchse for us. Probably good for parks and when it is a bit cooler.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

The plots centred around real people and events but Meade still made it seem as though his fictional events had happened and the characters, while being sterotypes, were good. Unfortunately, in this latest book, this is not the case. The plot is too flimsy to hold attention and the characters are boring...you don't care if they live or die. The big surprise at the end is predictable.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Every character in this novel was one-dimensional, and the book was so dialogue heavy. It never SHOWED me what the characters were feeling, but only what they were saying. I love Diana Palmer but this book was such a dissapointment. I wanted to love it, but I did not care about whether the characters got together or whether they lived or died. This was one of the worst books I've ever read. The only reason I finished it was to be fair to one of my favorite authors. Pass on this one; it's a waste of time.

A Chorus Line changed the face of American musical theater, with an urbane book by Nick Dante and James Kirkwood and sophisticated yet obvious lyrics and music by Ed Kleban and Marvin Hamlisch. The Pulitzer prize-winning musical has been resurrected in Broadway and on CD . . . And we can't wonder why. Those familiar with the original cast recording will cringe at the flatness of the \"new\" recording, a recording that's simultaneously intrusive on the memory and superfluous in any collection.

The music is a great example of the master orchestrator at his best, where he finds invents some good themes and hangs the orchestra around them It's similar in quality to his other \"for the concert hall\" pieces that I know (particularly his Violin Concerto and Bassoon Concerto). The CD leaves me with one question in my mind: Why wasn't a well-known orchestra used?

But what King did with such skill and beauty in \"IT\", drawing us into the make up of the individuals as well as the group dynamic, he merely pays lip service to in \"Dreamcatcher\". King sets us up with the key elements, but fails to deliver. We get only one course of the meal King has taught us to expect.This book made me want to re-read \"IT\", which I am currently doing with great pleasure.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

        "Title: Gets too hot, but it works\nReview: This enclosure is great except that it does not have any automatic power shutoff and it's passive cooling is in my opinion not enough. I have a 500 GB WD Caviar drive in there running all the time, probably wasting a lot of energy because when my computer goes into standby mode to save power, this drive for some reason continues to run, so it is always fairly warm. I have to physically turn it off at the switch to save power. Maybe I am missing something, but I guess I thought it would be smarter than that. Other than that, it is lightning fast, and it does my full backups (>300 GB) much, much faster than USB hard drive enclosures. As far as speed goes, this is a great model. If I could do it over, I would buy an enclosure with active cooling.\nIs this product review negative?",

While Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are outstanding books (five star worthy), Xenocide and Children of the Mind are simply irritating. I despised all the characters, who were so self-centered and so completely flawed you have no connection to them to care whether they die or live, and can't conceive they could succeed at anything. Page after page of characters contemplating their relationships with the other characters makes for a very boring read, and I found myself skimming much of the book. *spoiler* Without Ender, who essentially withdrawls from the narrative to have a relationship with his angry-at-the-world wife, there are simply no sympathetic or interesting characters that you really care about. But hey, at least I read all four books.",

Sure, Breakfast has many comical sections, however, it fails to answer any real question about human nature, other than the fact that we are innately dumb. The plot twists and turns, leading the reader through Vonnegut's \"reality\" of modern day society using Kilgore Trout and a used car salesmen as tour guides. Vonnegut plays on all aspects of society, from race, to industrialization, to the fragility of the human mind, and finally to the ability and far reaching possibilities of the imagination. Breakfast is witty and comical, but I recommend some of his other novels if you are looking for the better side of Vonnegut.\nAnswer:",

Their \"good grip\" makes them comfortable to use and heat resistant, but are their ultimate failing. If you used these every day, and put them in the dishwasher every day, the grip will break down and start leaving nasty black marks on your hands over time. How long? More than a year, but less than three. I keep hoping OXO will upgrade the quality of their black grips, but sadly no change. So, I gave up. I simply buy these and expect to throw them out in a couple of years, and buy another pair. They are good enough in all other ways that I'm willing to do that. There are a lot of other tong choices, and I've tried a few, but none that perform as well as these. Just don't think they'll last forever if you run them through the dishwasher regularly.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

There are also a few 1/3 & 1/2 page ads. So all togather about half of the mag is advertisements. The mag is alsofull of graphics and full page pics. There are only a few articles and they are generally not presenting original, thought provoking material.I canceled my subscription after three issues. Maybe this mag is geared more toward body builders that can't read.",

What Kiss fan on earth would have any need to buy this CD? They released a massive box set just a few years ago, for crying out loud. I'm a Kiss fan, it'd be great to own every Kiss album for the sake of having the complete catalouge, but I mean come on already. They're not just beating the dead horse now, they're holding it by the hind legs and thrashing the carcass back and forth into a pulp.

An edition from Cambridge University Press is available on Amazon. This version contains dark scanned pages from a previously owned copy, replete with underlinings and scrawled marginal notes. I'm not joking. I looked up the publishing company (Kessinger), and it appears this kind of dodgy business is their schtick. The CUP version only costs a little more, and it's, well, you know, a normal book.As far as Bradley's thought is concerned. I've only read the shorter appearance bit thus far, but if want to see metaphysics at its most unhinged, this is the book for you. I for one love it.",

They get in the way and obstruct the reading and meaning unnecessarily.The book also presents appreciation of small things as being superior to appreciating other things yet the argument is not backed up with any rationale.

W. was and is a personality of feeble intellect and stunted, 7-year-old emotions.But that's all Stone does.He leaves it at that.Imagine if a movie were made about Hitler or Stalin and only covered their psychological problems. No doubt they had them. But the only reason people would care is the enormity of their crimes.Same here.SOME time should have been devoted to W's idiotic, murderous, neglectful, help-the-rich and kick-the-poor policies.On the other hand, Thandie Newton is terrific as Condoleeza Rice; and Richard Dreyfus is superb as Cheney.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

I must say that this book should be one of the first that you read if you are beginning the series (which I HIGHLY recommend). The story is set in Nero's Rome and introduces two of Yarbro's main characters (Roger and Olivia) to the story arc. The writing is magnificent, and the attention to detail in the historical background is wonderful. Rome is portrayed as a wonderfully alien place rather than \"Americans in Togas\" that some historical writers seem to go for.

And the problem isn't just in one or two episodes. The abysmal video quality ruins your viewing pleasure for all six (count em, six!) disks.

This twist produced an electric shudder in the gut. Written from the perspective of one of a set of young twin boys, the inner dialogue of this character feels genuine. The plot speeds you along on a can't-put-it-down read, despite much interior action.",

Mesmerizing production design, much better than on the Schumacher films. Danny Elfman's greatest score. Critics have complained that \"Batman Returns\" has no real plot, and I agree. But who cares?! This is a great movie. One of the best ever made. EVER!!! I love the scenes between Keaton and Pfeifer, especially the one where they're dancing, and the Penguin crashes the party. Oh, and by the way... whoever said that this was the worst Batman film and that \"Batman Forever\" is better because it captures the spirit of adventure of the cartoon is dead wrong. Sorry kid, but the REAL Batman is the dark, brooding version of the comics. Here, Burton comes SO much closer to this than Joel Schumacher could.\nAnswer:",

Having had these before and inevitably enduring their failure, I was determined to buy a switch that has more to offer than the green plastic knob. I found it at (where else?) Amazon.com of course! This knife switch has a visual confirmation that the current is either \"on\" or \"off\". When the green plastic knob type fails there is no visual clue so you have to go through a sequence of disconnecting electrical connections and eliminating possible culprits. A real pain in the you-know-what. If you are in need of this type of switch, do yourself a big favor. Pay a little more and get a LOT more...performance.

        "Title: Mutilation\nProduct review: I'm very big fan of Harry Potter series (book) that's why my soul is in pain every time they choose horrible directors than seem not to have ever, ever touch a Harry Potter book in their life. The movie mutilates the book, I know they can't do a 4 hours movie, but they can do it in 2 parts of 2 hours so you do not loose important sub-plot, like the relationship, between Harry and Sirius, or the fact that in the movie Albus Dumbledore act as I thought the Albus Dumbledore would never in my wildest dreams would act, pushing Harry around, and I now that if you are a fan of this books you should have cry in that part too.In conclusion this movie was made for people who never read the book, never will read the book and do not care about it at all.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

This DVD is GREAT. It teaches all the letter sounds with a catchy song. Children like it and learn their letter sounds from it. The only drawback is that it doesn't teach both the long and short vowel sounds, only the short. The only other rival is Challenger School's tape which you can only purchase via Challenger Schools. Its sister DVD, Word Factory is also good but if you choose one, go with the talking letter factory. Once your kids have the letter sounds, skies the limit!\nAnswer:",

The movie changed how I see great epics. A little bloody, but after all that was the way of the world back then, right? Ridley Scott again amazes the audience with great scenes, excellent plot, script, and acting, and dazzling special effects.

Tolkien is an adventurous, fantasy tale that takes place in the land of the middle earth. However, even with many \"nail-biting\"/ action sequences, this story reveals tender and moving themes. Courage, trust, and friendship are the three most dominant themes projected in this tale of adventure. On their quest to restore the dwarves wealth and pride; Bilbo, Gandalf, and the 13 Dwarves encounter numerous challenges of both the emotional and physical nature. Bilbo's revelation from a timid, do-gooder hobbit to a daring thief is the most exciting transformation experienced. Though the story seems to take off at a slow pace, Tolkien's descriptions really pull the reader into the action. If you wish to read of battles with goblins, wargs, spiders, trolls, and the occasional dragon, then don't be turned off by what seems like unnecessary detail in the beginning. The Key, However, is to keep reading, it gets better.\nAnswer:",

All I could think of while watching it, however, is how little I learned about K and its bands. This is not a documentary in any sense but a festival of self-congratulation and self-aggrandizing (with the exception of the most celebrated character -- Calvin Johnson -- who comes off as thoughtful and nearly heroic). It quickly becomes a promotional spot for Beat Happening, though we never hear the name Heather nor hear from or about her -- and she wrote and sang nearly half their songs! The director assumes a vast amount of former knowledge about K and the bands, then proceeds to sell their wares to us. Alienating. Runs counter to the spirit of the times and the music. An utter shame. And I can only look back in my memory for the real deal, cause I was there, & this wasn't even an hint of the story.\nAnswer:",

The choice of this software is crucial since with most of them, including the software it ships with, it is a very limited device. However there is a media server that makes this box very versatile and much more useful, it can be found at http://www.tversity.comThe DLink Media Server software ships with this device and when used you end up not being able to play WMV, or ipod AAC files. Also high bitrate MP3 files won't play. The online content that comes with it is very limited and pretty much useless.The TVersity Media Server adds support for WMV playback as well as ipod AAC, high bitrate mp3 and many many more formats. It also makes it possible to play virtually any online content and it comes with the ability to play all the movie trailers from ifilm on your TV as well as Radio and TV stations from around the world. Very cool stuff!\nAnswer:",

It explains the basic items in simple terms, and even expands on items if you dare to want to know more. The tips were a great help as well. I now know the difference among the 1040EZ, 1040A, and 1040. I know when I can itemize and when I shouldn't. It also gave great tips on what I can deduct. If I had not read this book, I would not have known to deduct the interest paid on my student loan (and I didn't even have to use Form 1040!) It is also worth mentioning that I finished the book in one day! I highly recommend this book to people with beginner and intermediate knowledge of taxes.",

Bernie's lyrics positvely blow, however, and get in the way of Elton himself. Songs like the obnoxiously homophobic All the Young Girls Love Alice, racist and sexist Sweet Painted Lady, I've Seen That Movie Too and This Song Has No Title have some of the worst lyrics ever. And some of the songs are awful even without the lyrics: the supremely annoying hit Bennie and the Jets, Roy Rogers, Social Disease, Ballad of Danny Bailey, I've Seen That Movie Too...Anyway, there are only five songs I do like on this album: Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding, Candle in the Wind, title track, Grey Seal and Saturday Night's All Right for Fighting. But this is one thin album outside of those - I'd recommend the self-titled record, Madman Across the Water and Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player instead.",

Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are absolutely phenomenal. What a great story. I watch this movie over and over and it captivates me every time. The music is perfect...the acting is perfect...the story is gripping. People are upset because the film never fully explains itself in the end. It allows the viewer to interperet the film's meaning on their own and draw their own conclusions. I have my own, but due to the risk of offending certain demographs, my thoughs shall remain my own. Besides...I would hate it if a first time viewer were to read this review and have a picture already in their head. Watch this fantastic film and make up your own mind and don't let anybody tell you that your interperetation is wrong! There is no such thing as a incorrect interperetation of a piece of artwork be it a sculpture, piece of music, or a film with imagery like this!P.S. - BUY THE SOUNDTRACK, TOO!

However, this one has some serious weaknesses apart from the fact that I personally don't like made up kingdoms and princesses. Part of the story is set in Austria and therefore there are some supposedly German parts mixed into the dialogue. However, Ms. Barton should do a little more research to offer correct German. Only because there are Umlaute does not mean that every vowel gets two little dots on top. The question 'How are you`, when literately translated, asks for a characteristic of a person rather than being a polite formula. The answer to this question could be something like nice, fat or stupid.So, I found this booh really quite boring and way too far fetched.

Very good sound for the money. As others have noted, the line inputs are not terribly sensitive, and my Blue-ray player's line outs put out barely enough; I crank the amp's volume control almost all the way up with most movies. No one has complained of insufficient volume. (Someone wrote that there is a line-in sensitivity adjustment or a max gain adjustment or the like, but I cannot find it.) A preamp with a 3- or 4-volt line out would solve this problem and add needed spectrum control, but at greatly increased cost. You can power either of two pairs of speaker connections but not both; the spec sheet is a little vague on this point. I wouldn't upgrade from this amp before spending at least $2000 on speakers.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

        "Title: Good, quick literature read\nReview: Steinbeck is one of my favorite American authors, I've read most of his novels. I hadn't read this book since 10th grade, so I bought a new copy and read it again. I like the imagery and characterizations. It's a good story, plus it is a good book to read when you want to read \"literature\" but are intimidated by the 800-page Russian or British books. (Or likewise, Grapes of Wrath) The major problem I have with this book and much of Steinbeck's works are that the majority of women are portrayed as [prostitutes] who let their sexuality cause evil. Even on the back of this novel, it says something like \"George protected innocent Lenny until a flirtacious woman...\" I'm just tired of Steinbeck's view of women as evil sexual temptresses (East of Eden, Wayward Bus) or [prostitutes] (Cannery Row, Sweet Thursday)... definately worth reading though.\nIs the review positive or negative?",

I know some of you are thinking \"hey man, it's a kids book, lighten up\", but you know as well as I that our kids minds are very malleable at a young age and messages like this can and will shape their worldviews as they grow up. Imagine an entire generation of people who refused to push themselves because it was too hard or too uncomfortable. This nation rose to the top for the very reason that people pushed themselves and took risks that were uncomfortable. My recommendation: if you see this book, burn it.\nAnswer:",

Hopefuly as there english learning progresses and they can express themselfs more through lyrics and interviews they will be a fantastic act to watch in the future.Good luck breaking through into the USA, it is a tuff journey and I hope you plot it well else they will become a one-hit-wonder in America.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

This monster was not actually called Frankenstein, it was not slow and lumbering, it was not stupid or incapable of speech. While the literary critics have been historically slow to warm to this novel, it is a work of substantive quality and structure. It also conveys a powerful message about good versus evil, vanity, and personal responsibility. This novel is really, in a lot of ways, more than a horror story, its about how people view themselves and those around them. There is much debate (in literary circles) around whether or not Mary Shelley actually wrote the novel of her own accord or whether she had a good deal of help. I would suggest the paucity of anything else even remotely in the class of Frankenstein would lead one to certain suspicions.\nAnswer:",

Based on my lofty expectations for a Michael Crichton (MC) production I can only score it at one star. I realize the majority of Amazon reviewers don't agree with me, but I have loved everything done by this amazing science fiction writer in the past, and this film just didn't do it for me. I even watched this movie twice, once without commentary and a second time with MC narration. It just didn't work. I am glad to see that the majority of reviewers really appreciate what MC can do, even on what for me was one of his \"off days\". I also think the actors did a fine job under very difficult circumstances. I scarcely need mention some of my favorite MC films but I absolutely loved the Andromeda Strain, Coma, Jurassic Park, Congo, not to mention all of his other fine science fiction and non scifi novels.\nDoes this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?",

In the first cartoon, Grandfather Frost (Russian Santa Claus) leaves the North Pole to find out what is this thing called \"summer\". There is music to rival that in \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\". The third cartoon is about a poor woodsman, the orphan (and her cat) whom he adopts, and ... a legendary silver-hoofed deer. Magical, beautiful, emotional, perfect for Christmas Eve.

At last count, 152 Amazon reviewers gave this book an average of 5 stars. It is undoubtably on the short list for \"Books that Changed My Live\" for countless people. I suggest that the real wisdom to be found in this book comes not on the first reading, but upon re-reading (luckily, the book is short and moves quickly, too). All of the self-help books out there, from Deepak Chopra to Stephen Covey to Dr. Phil, are mere twaddle compared to this book. There is more truth and wisdom in one sentence of Frankl than in many volumes of other books. Do yourself a favor and buy this book (and pass a copy on to a friend afterward). You will immediately see positive changes in your life. And don't be dissuaded by the context, believe it or not, this is a life-affirming book that happens to take place in a concentration camp.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

Driving is squirrely and not very realistic, a truck moving at moderate speed can leave the ground quite easily, seems they were attempting to simulate a low gravity environment?

Along the way the plot goes downhill after a semi-gripping opening assassination, the action becomes ridiculous, and the relationship between Bel and the hit man that starts out creepy becomes predictable and annoying. Rankin's writing equals the triteness of his story.Rankin's Rebus series is mostly excellent, but this book is garbage compared to those novels. Did Rankin feel like he wanted to try writing something different, something edgy? Whatever the reason, this books is a failure.

He, of course, returns her regard, for reasons which remain wholly inexplicable. Maria Greene gives us the story of two thoroughly disagreeable people who behave like immature brats. I could barely read it, it was so bad. And last of all Kate Huntington gives us what may just possibly be the most unlikeable 'hero' ever created in a regency romance.

Between the post office and the blizzard, the book was lost for a month. Each time I wrote to The Professor, he (she?) got back to me immediately. He was polite, professional, and, when the post office made the last of its mistakes, resent me the book, express mail, at no extra cost to me.If you have the opportunity to pick your bookseller, you can't go wrong with this one.",

As you read the hour-by-hour account of Lincoln's last day, Bishop makes you feel as though you are there on the fringe watching as the minutes tick away. You can almost hear every conversation, observe their non-verbal cues, and feel the emotion as the cabinet sits around the table talking about what to do after the war is over. I strongly recommend this book to anyone regardless of age.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

As an experienced C++ programmer, but a newcomer to ATL, I looked for a single source of information on the hows and whys of ATL. There are many good books out there, but each seems to fill a niche. But with this book I found, in one place, answers to all the questions I've been wrestling with for months now. Besides covering ATL, it contains a wealth of tips and tidbits that you'll likely run across during coding and testing that arent covered anywhere else. This fact alone justifies buying the book. I'm resigned that one book cant cover everything a programmer may need to know about ATL, but after digesting this one I'm confident that I'll be able to digest the others as well. I paid list price for this one, but I dont regret it. Neither will you.\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

The Sword in the Stone explains King Arthur's youth throughout the book. His name is Wart in the book> From the adventures he takes with the other legends and queens to the learning experiences he has as animals, you won't want to put it down.What makes this book unique is Warts learning experience. He changes into four animals and he turns invisible by Merlin, Warts tutor. The adventures he goes on are amazing. He goes to a giants castle and goes to Morgan le Fay's castle to rescue Friar Tuck. Coming out they had to fight big bird-lion things. The book had no real conflicts.I don't really like reading, but this book is interesting. If you like fantasies then you would like this book. The reason is that he changes into different animals, turns invisible, and fights monsters. It is for readers 13+.\nIs this product review negative?",

The Hot Boys put out an album with like 5 or 6 really strong songs. And as bunch of other average or a little better songs. Not really any horrible songs at all. The Best Songs are the main 4 \"I Need A Hot Girl\", \"We On Fire\", \"Respect My Mind\" & \"Tuesday & Thursday\". Those 4 songs were the songs I listened to every morning for like months and months. And i have over 200 cd's! So this cd must be good huh? \"Ridin'\" is another real tight one! Then the other songs all blend in with the rest like \"Clear Tha Set\" by Lil'Wayne. \"Ya Dig\" by Juvenile. \"Help\" by B.G., and \"Bout Whatever\" by Turk. I Think it's cool that all of them got there own solo songs. \"Too Hot\" is nice too..along with the rest of the songs. Juvenile, B.G., Turk & Lil'Wayne put out one of the best cd's of '99, and also the best group cd to come out for a long while!It's real good!\nWould you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light?",

I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in having his or her work published. The information runs the gamut from how to write query letters to handling rejections.

It was just a bit too cheesy for my taste-a bit too unbelievable. I couldn't find much substance here. For an adult book it just seemed a bit juvenile for my taste. The characters did not act the way I would expect intelligent adults (as lawyers -they were supposed to be quite bright) even considering the fact that they were \"infected\" with this ridiculous disease. And the way the legal jargon was tossed into the dialogue.

The plot is completely scatter-brained, often makes no sense, and is obnoxiously repetitive. Really, there must be 50 jousting scenes and the all are exactly the same. Movie also includes the worst villian ever; his dialog is stupid, trite, and over-the-top. The final battle includes a stare down between him and Heath that goes back and forth for what seems an eternity. But perhaps the dumbest part of the whole show is the overly dramatic, unrealistic, and very forgettable romance between Heath and the princess.

But we've become accustomed to their sound so if you're a true Trower fan don't be so critical open your ears to the music not so much on the vocals. \"Go My Way\" is a great CD Robin's best in a long time I recommend that you purchase this CD and share with someone who may say \"Robin Trower who is that\" then give them an ear full! And to Robin Trower all I have to say is sang on, play on brotha!\nAnswer:",

        "Title: It keeps working!\nReview: The Simple Tech card worked from day 1, and still works 4 months later. Probably have taken close to 1000 shots on this card cumulatively.The same cannot be said for two other Viking Cards, one 512 MB, one 256 MB. Both worked in the beginning, then days later generated corrupt image files. (Go to Viking compact flash 512MB for my detailed review)By the way, I own a G3, and cannot tell meaningful difference in speed among Simple Tech, Viking, and the Lexar 12X I just received.\nIs this product review negative?",

        "Title: Not interesting at all\nReview: I was supposed to read this for English class,and had some interest because I`ve heard people and my teacher say that this was an American classic and was very good.But once I heard some of my friends who started to read it and say it was difficult and boring,I got the book on audio to assist me.I only got to chapter 3 and I was trying to guess how many pages were left to the end.Its uniteresting and difficult because the story wanders with absolutly no direction.I highly recomend getting Cliff Notes(which I got and are very easy to understand compared to the book) and possibly the movie(It might not be the same to the book, but having the visual aid of Demi Moore certainly helps the mind focus better).\nIs this product review negative?",
