        "Background: Many chemicals that were once commonly used were later found out to be harmful to the environment , to human health, or both. The element lead was once a common additive to gasoline and to paint. Plumbing pipes were once typically made of lead. Only since the 1970s has the danger of lead become apparent. It causes brain damage and small children (who often chewed on objects painted with lead-based paint) are particularly susceptible. The use of lead in gasoline, paint, and plumbing pipes is now banned and new materials are being developed to replace the hazardous lead components.\n\nParagraph: There is a study being conducted on a group of small children. Group A is a group from a town that was rated highest quality water in the United States, while Group B is from Flint, Michigan, where it was found that lead was in their water supply.\n\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group has a higher likely hood of brain damage?",

Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year. A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or prevent corrosion.\n\nI am facing a new situation today: Aaron is doing a science experiment for school. He is trying to see what happens to different iron objects in different conditions. He has two samples that he is testing. Sample A he has placed in a dark dry room away from the elements. Sample B he has placed outside under no cover, so it will be rained on.\n\nUsing the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which sample will most likely not show many signs of corrosion?",

        "I have a new situation: Bill is planning on moving soon. He wants to move to a city that has fresher air and more wildlife to see. His two options that he must choose from are St. Louis and Seattle. Recently, Seattle has installed a new wind farm, and zero emission solar farm to generate power, while St. Louis recently installed a coal fired power plant. Both cities have similar commercial and industrial sectors, and only differ in how they generate power.\n\nBut I can use this background: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust.\n\nWhat is an answer for this question: Will Seattle have more or less acid rain than St. Louis?",

They both want to get a good time, and are both avid runners.\n\nBut I can use this background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).\n\nWhat is an answer for this question: Does Carl have a higher or lower chance of injury than Greg?",

        "Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word \u201cOpen\u201d in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light.\n\nBob owns a store that sells signs. He has a large selection of different signs that are for sale, and they come in all sorts of different colors. His closed sign is a reddish-orange. His open sign is a violet color, and his sale sign is blue.\n\nIs the open sign more or less likely to be Krypton than Neon?",

        "Background: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nParagraph: Bob is planning a couple of trips for himself. He wants to do some traveling in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. He decided he wants to go to Arizona and Peru at some point in the year, but only wants to go when it is warmest as he hates cold weather.  He is free for his travel in July and August, and again in December and January, and needs to figure out the best months for each of his trips.\n\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: When would be the best months to travel to Arizona for the warmest weather?",

The mortality can be divided into two types:\n\nNatural mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to causes not associated with fishing. Such causes can include disease, competition, cannibalism, old age, predation, pollution or any other natural factor that causes the death of fish. In fisheries models natural mortality is denoted by (M).[1]\nFishing mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to fishing activities using any fishing gear.[1] It is denoted by (F) in fisheries models.\n\nNow, I have a new situation: Tony is about to go on two fishing trips in the up coming week. On Friday, he is going to Bear Lake, which is located near a factory that has been known to dump waste into the lake. On Saturday, he is going to Fox Lake, which is in a secluded valley.\n\nAnswer this question please: Which lake most likely has a lower mortality rate for it's fish population?",

The mortality can be divided into two types:\n\nNatural mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to causes not associated with fishing. Such causes can include disease, competition, cannibalism, old age, predation, pollution or any other natural factor that causes the death of fish.

        "Background: About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock.\n\nParagraph: Craig is traveling the country and seeing the different sites. On Monday and Tuesday, he will be seeing a vast field where an old battle happened, called Marshall Field. It is now mostly used for farming for its fertile soil. On Thursday and Friday Craig will venture to see Smuggler's Caves, an intricate cave system that used to be used by smuggler's and pirates.\n\nGiven the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will Craig have more or less chance of seeing limestone on Thursday than Tuesday?",
