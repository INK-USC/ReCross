        "My college roommate asked me what this article means:\n\nPhandu Skelemani made the apology after Kenya's government accused him of being contemptuous towards Uhuru Kenyatta.\nThe International Criminal Court has charged Mr Kenyatta with crimes against humanity.\nHe denies the charges and won the 4 March poll with an outright majority.\nHe got 50.07% of the vote compared to his rival Raila Odinga's 43.31%.\nMr Odinga has refused to accept defeat, saying the election was marred by fraud and is expected to file a petition challenging the result at Kenya's Supreme Court on Friday.\nAnalysts say the ICC case bolstered Mr Kenyatta's electoral chances, as voters saw it as interference in Kenya's domestic affairs.\nHe is due to stand trial in July, with the charges stemming from allegations that he helped orchestrate violence that erupted after the 2007 election.\nEarlier this week, his lawyer, Steven Kay, called on the ICC to drop the case, saying the evidence against him was \"utterly flawed\".\nMr Kay made the call after ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda dropped charges against Mr Kenyatta's co-accused, Francis Muthaura, because a key witness had \"recanted\" his evidence and other witnesses were too scared to testify.\nMr Skelemani said he was retracting comments he made to Botswana's privately owned Mmegi newspaper following Mr Kenyatta's election victory.\n\"I apologise to the Kenyan people for my earlier statement and wish to maintain that Kenya and Botswana have always worked together and nothing will change that,\" he said, in a statement published in the Kenyan media.\n\"Mr Uhuru Kenyatta is more than welcome to visit Botswana. Botswana is cognisant of a section of the law that says one is innocent until proven guilty.\"\nEarlier this week, Mr Skelemani was quoted by Mmegi as saying that Mr Kenyatta would not be allowed to \"set foot\" in Botswana if he refused to cooperate with the ICC.\n\"If he refuses to go [to The Hague], then we have a problem. That means that they do not know the rule of law,\" he is quoted as saying.\n\"You can't establish a court and refuse to go when it calls...\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:",

        "First, please read the article below.\n\nDubbed Nuit Debout (Up All Night), it is a self-styled \"popular assembly\" in which participants share views about politics and the state of the world.\nAs night descends, the speakers stand patiently in line and, turn by turn, take the microphone for their allotted five minutes.\nBefore them, sitting in twos and threes on paving stones, the young audience responds with the occasional cheer or boo.\nNot that there is a huge amount to react to. The speeches are rambling and platitudinous.\nOne orator says the essence behind society should be \"values\" - but she does not say which.\nAnother urges an end to hierarchy - \"no more pride, no more ego - just ideas\".\nA third wants to speak of human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nOne theme that recurs is the need to tolerate divergences of opinion. This is significant. Two nights previously, one of France's best-known philosophers - a man who a generation ago would have himself been at the mike - was spat on and told to leave.\nBoth speakers and listeners appear to be mainly students - an impression confirmed by a tour of the various \"stands\".\nThe feminists are in a large huddle, and I am asked not to take photographs. Elsewhere, a screen shows a laborious film made by a woman who took a job distributing junk mail and wants to expose the exploitation.\nThere is a group of anti-speciesists, and a \"TV studio\" (TV Debout!) consisting of a camera and white sheet and a lap-top. No-one is using it.\nSomeone has planted a minuscule vegetable patch beneath a tree (Jardin Debout!).\nOne banner calls for a new French constitution.

        "Dubbed Nuit Debout (Up All Night), it is a self-styled \"popular assembly\" in which participants share views about politics and the state of the world.\nAs night descends, the speakers stand patiently in line and, turn by turn, take the microphone for their allotted five minutes.\nBefore them, sitting in twos and threes on paving stones, the young audience responds with the occasional cheer or boo.\nNot that there is a huge amount to react to. The speeches are rambling and platitudinous.\nOne orator says the essence behind society should be \"values\" - but she does not say which.\nAnother urges an end to hierarchy - \"no more pride, no more ego - just ideas\".\nA third wants to speak of human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nOne theme that recurs is the need to tolerate divergences of opinion. This is significant. Two nights previously, one of France's best-known philosophers - a man who a generation ago would have himself been at the mike - was spat on and told to leave.\nBoth speakers and listeners appear to be mainly students - an impression confirmed by a tour of the various \"stands\".\nThe feminists are in a large huddle, and I am asked not to take photographs. Elsewhere, a screen shows a laborious film made by a woman who took a job distributing junk mail and wants to expose the exploitation.\nThere is a group of anti-speciesists, and a \"TV studio\" (TV Debout!) consisting of a camera and white sheet and a lap-top. No-one is using it.\nSomeone has planted a minuscule vegetable patch beneath a tree (Jardin Debout!).\nOne banner calls for a new French constitution.

Dodgson did so as a Christmas gift in 1864 with his own illustrations.\nIt went on to become one of the best known works in children's literature, with numerous TV and film adaptations.\nThe stamps feature famous scenes from the book including the Mad Hatter's tea party and Alice falling down the rabbit hole.\nIllustrator Grahame Baker-Smith said he had based the images of Alice on the stamps on his own daughter.\n\"The most difficult thing was consistency and working on such a very small scale. They all have to work as a set, so you want to have a range of colour and tone across the 10 stamps.\n\"The Royal Mail has a rich history of illustration on stamps, so the chance to have a go at that is a great opportunity.\"\nAndrew Hammond, Royal Mail director of stamps and collectibles, said: \"The story of Alice in Wonderland remains a perennial favourite of children, and indeed adults, around the world.\n\"It is fitting that in its 150th anniversary year it is celebrated with a wonderful set of stamps featuring striking images that do justice to such an iconic tale.\"\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:",

        "When we flick the light switch or kettle, ancient plant and animal material, that formed hundreds of millions of years ago, are consumed in an instant.\nThe ancient geological past is powering the present, but for how much longer?\nHow ironic that our modern world is so hopelessly wedded to a substance that began life tens of millions of years ago.\nAnd yet it is the liberation of that fossil solar energy tens of millions of years later that transformed the planet and redefined us as a species.\nIt is that transformation that I'm fascinated by and why I wanted to make this three-part series about our addiction to crude and to help me answer a fundamental question.\nWhen did planet Earth become Planet Oil?\nIt's a series that's also been a personal journey.\nMy childhood and teenage years were spent oblivious to the stunning advances in petroleum science and technology that evolved furiously to exploit the buried bonanza off our shores.\nI was born in November 1964.\nA huge gas field had been discovered off the coast of Holland a few years earlier and geologists soon worked out that the very same hydrocarbon-bearing rocks ran all the way to the British coast.\nBy December 1964, the race was on to find oil and gas in the British sector of the North Sea.\nThe well drilled that winter was dry. But the following year, the Sea Gem drilling platform hit pay dirt, or rather natural gas.\nThe euphoria was short lived after disaster struck on Boxing Day 1965, with 14 men losing their lives.\nIt was an inauspicious start of what would become an engineering revolution that turned the UK's energy fortunes around.\nBy the time I was starting primary school, attention had shifted to the deeper waters northeast of Aberdeen and the first oil fields had been found - Brent and Forties - so-called \"giant\" fields that rivalled those of the Middle East.\nMy school days were punctuated by evening news footage of the latest platform being dragged out of yards and off to the wilds of the North Sea.\nAs a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed 20-year-old...\nHow would you rephrase that in a few words?",

        "Article: Flintshire factory cleaner Trevor Fletcher, 60, fell unconscious at work in Deeside's Toyota Manufacturing UK.\nPrompt life-saving action from colleagues kept him alive until the air ambulance team arrived from Welshpool.\nDr John Glen, an anaesthetist on board, said teamwork at all stages had helped to save Mr Fletcher.\nHe works at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Denbighshire and also with the Emergency Medical Retrival and Transfer Service Cymru.\nHe said: \"The patient was given first aid and CPR by a colleague, a defibrillator was on hand, paramedics arrived to give more intensive resuscitation and insert a tube to help him breathe.\n\"The helicopter was able to reach him quickly and had an expert on board, and finally he was flown directly a specialist cardiac centre.\n\"Without all these stages, he probably won't have made it - if he had, he would be in a bad way, and certainly not up and about in a few weeks, cracking jokes.\"\nOnce Mr Fletcher was stabilised, he was flown to the North Wales Cardiac Centre at Glan Clwyd where he was treated at a specialist laboratory, and then transferred to Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral to be closer to his family.\nOnce he recovered, Mr Fletcher, who lives in Birkenhead, travelled to Welshpool where the air ambulance is based, to meet Dr Glen and the team to say thank you.\n\"I hadn't been feeling well for a while, with a cough, and finally went to see my GP, who gave me antibiotics and said there was a problem with my chest,\" he said.\n\"I didn't realise it at the time, but it was actually pneumonia, which was only confirmed when I was at Glan Clwyd.\n\"I was at work and said to my colleagues I felt unwell and was going out for some fresh air.\n\"When I didn't come back they went to find me and a security guard found me unconscious.\n\"Really, the first I knew was waking up in Arrowe Park hospital.\n\"It's thanks to the doctors on the helicopter, and all the medical staff in the two hospitals, that I am alive now and I am able to go back to work, plus spend time with my family.\"\n\nSummary:",

Most importantly, she stresses, friends will pull you through the hard times.\nThe record reunites Jackson with producers Jam and Lewis, who rescued her from bargain bin ignominy in 1986, and masterminded all of her most successful albums, from Control to janet and beyond.\nSpeaking to the BBC from New Orleans, Jimmy Jam revealed the stories behind the star's signature songs, and picked his highlights from the new album.\nJanet's first single with Jam & Lewis, What Have You Done For Me Lately presents the singer as a fierce, independent woman, ruthlessly dismissing her feckless boyfriend. \"You ought to be thankful for the little things,\" she scolds, \"but little things are all you seem to give.\"\nOriginally, What Have You Done For Me Lately was going to be a track on an album Terry and I were working on - our own album.

However, it needs to reach the 74.6% figure to close the jobs gap.\nThe London-based think tank's report was published ahead of the latest official employment figures, which are due to be released on Wednesday.\nIt found that while Scotland had experienced a \"comparatively disappointing performance\" on employment since the financial crash, it had undergone a less severe squeeze on pay.\nTypical pay in Scotland is currently 5.7% below its 2009 peak, compared with a drop of 9.1% across England.\nAnalysis released by the foundation  earlier this week suggested that typical pay in Scotland was now marginally higher than in England.\nThe foundation warned that stronger employment gains would be needed if Scotland were to maintain its new pay advantage.\nIts report said: \"Scotland's incomplete recovery on jobs may lead to slower pay growth in the future relative to other nations and regions of the UK.\"\nConor D'Arcy, policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \"Scotland enjoyed a significantly higher employment rate than England in the years running up to the financial crisis. But its relatively poor track record in recent years means that it has fallen back in line with England.\n\"This puts Scotland's new-found pay advantage over England at risk and it's vital that its job gap is closed sooner rather than later.\n\"Attention must then turn to why Scotland is lagging behind some other areas of the UK, and what can be done to speed up its sluggish employment growth.\n\"In order to move towards full employment, it is important for employers to offer 'pull factors' to encourage people who may not actively be looking for work...\n\nTL;DR:",

However, it needs to reach the 74.6% figure to close the jobs gap.\nThe London-based think tank's report was published ahead of the latest official employment figures, which are due to be released on Wednesday.\nIt found that while Scotland had experienced a \"comparatively disappointing performance\" on employment since the financial crash, it had undergone a less severe squeeze on pay.\nTypical pay in Scotland is currently 5.7% below its 2009 peak, compared with a drop of 9.1% across England.\nAnalysis released by the foundation  earlier this week suggested that typical pay in Scotland was now marginally higher than in England.\nThe foundation warned that stronger employment gains would be needed if Scotland were to maintain its new pay advantage.\nIts report said: \"Scotland's incomplete recovery on jobs may lead to slower pay growth in the future relative to other nations and regions of the UK.\"\nConor D'Arcy, policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \"Scotland enjoyed a significantly higher employment rate than England in the years running up to the financial crisis. But its relatively poor track record in recent years means that it has fallen back in line with England.\n\"This puts Scotland's new-found pay advantage over England at risk and it's vital that its job gap is closed sooner rather than later.\n\"Attention must then turn to why Scotland is lagging behind some other areas of the UK, and what can be done to speed up its sluggish employment growth.\n\"In order to move towards full employment, it is important for employers to offer 'pull factors' to encourage people who may not actively be looking for work...\n\nNow, can you write me an extremely short abstract for it?",

        "Summarize: The Conservatives won power promising: \"If an EU migrant's child is living abroad, then they should receive no child benefit\".\nThe letter from EU President Donald Tusk, setting out a possible new deal for the UK, says something rather different - such benefits could be indexed \"to the standard of living in the member state where the child resides\".\nRather than \"no child benefit\", EU migrants from poorer countries would receive less child benefit.\nOpponents of the Tusk deal have been quick to suggest even this negotiated position is impractical.\nSo could it work?\nThere are approximately 2.4 million EU migrants living in the UK - but less than 1% of them are receiving child benefit for children back in their homeland.\nRevenue & Customs suggests about 20,000 EU nationals receive the payment in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about \u00a330m.\nMost of those payments are for children resident in Poland, but several thousand Irish and French citizens resident in the UK also receive UK child benefit payments for children residing elsewhere.\nIt is a situation many regard as unfair.\nHowever, simply stopping the benefit altogether has proved tricky because it breaches a fundamental principle of the European Union - that EU citizens should have the same access to social protection as others in the country where they are living and working.\nWhat makes child benefit unique among welfare payments is the recipient of the money - the adult EU migrant - can be in one country while the dependent is in another.\nSo the solution proposed is that \"equal access\" takes into account the living standard of the country where the child resides.\nWe do not yet know the details, but it is likely that average or \"median\" incomes could be used as a measure for living standards in each member state.\nIn the UK, child benefit for the first child is \u00a320.70 a week - roughly 5% of the weekly median income.\nThat 5% figure could be used to calculate the payment in each EU state, based on its own median...",

        "The Conservatives won power promising: \"If an EU migrant's child is living abroad, then they should receive no child benefit\".\nThe letter from EU President Donald Tusk, setting out a possible new deal for the UK, says something rather different - such benefits could be indexed \"to the standard of living in the member state where the child resides\".\nRather than \"no child benefit\", EU migrants from poorer countries would receive less child benefit.\nOpponents of the Tusk deal have been quick to suggest even this negotiated position is impractical.\nSo could it work?\nThere are approximately 2.4 million EU migrants living in the UK - but less than 1% of them are receiving child benefit for children back in their homeland.\nRevenue & Customs suggests about 20,000 EU nationals receive the payment in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about \u00a330m.\nMost of those payments are for children resident in Poland, but several thousand Irish and French citizens resident in the UK also receive UK child benefit payments for children residing elsewhere.\nIt is a situation many regard as unfair.\nHowever, simply stopping the benefit altogether has proved tricky because it breaches a fundamental principle of the European Union - that EU citizens should have the same access to social protection as others in the country where they are living and working.\nWhat makes child benefit unique among welfare payments is the recipient of the money - the adult EU migrant - can be in one country while the dependent is in another.\nSo the solution proposed is that \"equal access\" takes into account the living standard of the country where the child resides.\nWe do not yet know the details, but it is likely that average or \"median\" incomes could be used as a measure for living standards in each member state.\nIn the UK, child benefit for the first child is \u00a320.70 a week - roughly 5% of the weekly median income.\nThat 5% figure could be used to calculate the payment in each EU state, based on its own median...\n\nTL;DR:",

Well, probably not.\nCertifying that Iran is upholding its end of the bargain does not preclude a fundamental US policy review - one that would be normal for any incoming administration, and, given the personnel surrounding US President Donald Trump, is likely to be far from sympathetic to Tehran.\nThe Iran deal of course was famously characterised by then candidate Mr Trump as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. For now it is still there and for all we know it may have considerable life in it yet.\nThe problem for US policy is to grapple with three aspects of Iran and its behaviour.\nFirstly, there is the nuclear issue, and whatever the controversy surrounding the nuclear deal, it does impose constraints on Tehran's nuclear programme in return for tangible economic benefits. Iran at the moment is not \"unchecked\", to use the term mentioned by Mr Tillerson.\nMany western experts back the deal even if they have little enthusiasm for it. Even senior security figures in Israel - who opposed the Obama administration's negotiation of the agreement - have tacitly accepted that it does provide a framework to manage the problem.\nReports suggest that even the Saudis - also long-time opponents of the agreement - have counselled Mr Trump not to abandon it. Of course it will not last for ever....\nSummary:",

Well, probably not.\nCertifying that Iran is upholding its end of the bargain does not preclude a fundamental US policy review - one that would be normal for any incoming administration, and, given the personnel surrounding US President Donald Trump, is likely to be far from sympathetic to Tehran.\nThe Iran deal of course was famously characterised by then candidate Mr Trump as one of the worst deals ever negotiated. For now it is still there and for all we know it may have considerable life in it yet.\nThe problem for US policy is to grapple with three aspects of Iran and its behaviour.\nFirstly, there is the nuclear issue, and whatever the controversy surrounding the nuclear deal, it does impose constraints on Tehran's nuclear programme in return for tangible economic benefits. Iran at the moment is not \"unchecked\", to use the term mentioned by Mr Tillerson.\nMany western experts back the deal even if they have little enthusiasm for it. Even senior security figures in Israel - who opposed the Obama administration's negotiation of the agreement - have tacitly accepted that it does provide a framework to manage the problem.\nReports suggest that even the Saudis - also long-time opponents of the agreement - have counselled Mr Trump not to abandon it. Of course it will not last for ever....\n\nTL;DR:",

And I said to myself it was the time to step up.\n\"The 131 was the first frame after the interval and that gave me the impetus to carry on.\n\"I got in to a rhythm and a stride and when I get I am quite hard to stop. It was important for me to stamp my authority on the match.\"\nLeeds potter Grace, who is ranked 81 in the world, beat former world champion Peter Ebdon in the fourth round.\n\nNow, can you write me an extremely short abstract for it?",

        "Article: Peter Barker and Alison Waters lost 11-8 11-10 to Australia's David Palmer and Rachael Grinham to give Palmer a first Commonwealth gold.\nThe 38-year-old then teamed up with Cameron Pilley to win his second title of the day in the men's doubles.\nThey beat top seeds Nick Matthew and Adrian Grant 10-11 11-7 11-9.\nMatthew had been chasing a double after his win over compatriot James Willstrop in the men's singles final.\nBut former world number one Palmer, who had won two silvers and four bronzes at previous Games, decided to come out of retirement in a bid to win his elusive first title.\nSheffield-born Matthew, 34, and Grant, 33, recovered from a slow start to take the first game, but the Australians took the second to force a decider and held their nerve to force the win.\n\"In singles there is a planning structure where if something goes wrong it is easier to correct but in doubles there are so many variables and it is such a momentum game,\" said Matthew.\n\"We did ourselves proud, we put out game plan into practice but they pulled off two great shots to win.\"\nEngland's Willstrop and Daryl Selby took bronze after beating Scotland's Alan Clyne and Harry Leitch 11-9 11-7.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIn the mixed doubles, the third-seeded Australians took an early lead but Barker and Waters led 6-2 early in the second before Palmer and Grinham fought back to make it 10-10 and then win the sudden-death point.\n\"We are disappointed to not convert that lead in the second game,\" said Barker. \"We played well throughout but in the first game they just hit some unbelievable winners.\n\"It was a great match and I thought we played the best we have all week and we lost to worthy champions.\"\nPalmer and Grinham's team-mates Cameron Pilley and Kasey Brown won bronze thanks to an 8-11 11-9 11-8 success over New Zealand's Joelle King and Martin Knight.\n\nSummary:",

        "Article: The University of Southampton team looked at available medical studies and found evidence the two were linked.\nBut there was no proof that one necessarily caused the other.\nIt may be that people taking anti-depressants put on weight which, in turn, increases their diabetes risk, the team told Diabetes Care journal.\nOr the drugs themselves may interfere with blood sugar control.\nTheir analysis of 22 studies involving thousands of patients on anti-depressants could not single out any class of drug or type of person as high risk.\nProf Richard Holt and colleagues say more research is needed to investigate what factors lie behind the findings.\nAnd they say doctors should keep a closer check for early warning signs of diabetes in patients who have been prescribed these drugs.\nWith 46 million anti-depressant prescriptions a year in the UK, this potential increased risk is worrying, they say.\nProf Holt said: \"Some of this may be coincidence but there's a signal that people who are being treated with anti-depressants then have an increased risk of going on to develop diabetes.\n\"We need to think about screening and look at means to reduce that risk.\"\nDiabetes is easy to diagnose with a blood test, and Prof Holt says this ought to be part of a doctor's consultation.\n\"Diabetes is potentially preventable by changing your diet and being more physically active.\n\"Physical activity is also good for your mental health so there's a double reason to be thinking about lifestyle changes.\"\nAround three million people in the UK are thought to have diabetes, with most cases being type 2.\nDr Matthew Hobbs of Diabetes UK, said: \"These findings fall short of being strong evidence that taking anti-depressants directly increases risk of type 2 diabetes. In this review, even the studies that did suggest a link showed only a small effect and just because two things tend to occur together, it doesn't necessarily mean that one is causing the other.\n\"But what is clear is that some anti-depressants lead to weight gain and that putting on weight...\n\nSummary:",

        "Summarize: United are reported to have agreed an \u00a318.9m fee for the keeper and Sir Alex Ferguson hopes to wrap up a deal soon.\nFormer United forward Forlan told BBC Sport: \"David will become a top player because he has a lot of ability.\n\"But he's only just had his first full season as Atletico's number one and is a young guy with little experience.\"\nLast month, Ferguson said he regarded De Gea as the natural replacement for Edwin van der Sar, who retired after United's Champions League final defeat by Barcelona, and admitted he had been tracking the Spaniard for \"quite a while\".\nDe Gea is currently playing for Spain at the European Under-21 Championships in Denmark, and says he wants to wait until the end of the tournament before signing a deal with United.\nForlan, 32, who played for United from 2002 to 2004, has been hugely impressed with De Gea since the Spaniard forced his way into Atletico's team towards the end of the 2009/10 season.\n\"There's no doubt that David will become a very, very good player, because he has the talent,\" Forlan said. \"He is tall, strong on crosses, a good shot stopper and distributes the ball very well.\n\"I suppose he is similar to Van der Sar in a lot of ways. Even though he is very young, he gives a lot of confidence to his defenders and has a lot of talent.\"\nForlan joined United for \u00a37.5m from Argentine side Independiente, but failed to cement a regular starting place at the club. He famously went 27 games before scoring for his new side and only hit the net 10 times in 63 games before moving to Villarreal.\nDavid is from a little town outside Madrid, has been at Atletico since he was very young and doesn't speak any languages other than Spanish\nHe admitted he does have concerns that De Gea, who came through the youth ranks at Atletico, could become homesick in Manchester.\n\"You never know for sure whether a player will adapt to a new country until he gets there,\" the Uruguayan said. \"It's true that I was also young when I joined United, just 22, but you can't compare our situations.\n\"I knew...",

        "My college roommate asked me what this article means:\n\nUnited are reported to have agreed an \u00a318.9m fee for the keeper and Sir Alex Ferguson hopes to wrap up a deal soon.\nFormer United forward Forlan told BBC Sport: \"David will become a top player because he has a lot of ability.\n\"But he's only just had his first full season as Atletico's number one and is a young guy with little experience.\"\nLast month, Ferguson said he regarded De Gea as the natural replacement for Edwin van der Sar, who retired after United's Champions League final defeat by Barcelona, and admitted he had been tracking the Spaniard for \"quite a while\".\nDe Gea is currently playing for Spain at the European Under-21 Championships in Denmark, and says he wants to wait until the end of the tournament before signing a deal with United.\nForlan, 32, who played for United from 2002 to 2004, has been hugely impressed with De Gea since the Spaniard forced his way into Atletico's team towards the end of the 2009/10 season.\n\"There's no doubt that David will become a very, very good player, because he has the talent,\" Forlan said. \"He is tall, strong on crosses, a good shot stopper and distributes the ball very well.\n\"I suppose he is similar to Van der Sar in a lot of ways. Even though he is very young, he gives a lot of confidence to his defenders and has a lot of talent.\"\nForlan joined United for \u00a37.5m from Argentine side Independiente, but failed to cement a regular starting place at the club. He famously went 27 games before scoring for his new side and only hit the net 10 times in 63 games before moving to Villarreal.\nDavid is from a little town outside Madrid, has been at Atletico since he was very young and doesn't speak any languages other than Spanish\nHe admitted he does have concerns that De Gea, who came through the youth ranks at Atletico, could become homesick in Manchester.\n\"You never know for sure whether a player will adapt to a new country until he gets there,\" the Uruguayan said. \"It's true that I was also young when I joined United, just 22, but you can't compare our situations.\n\"I knew...\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:",

        "My college roommate asked me what this article means:\n\nRetired Ch Supt Donald Denton told the new inquests he could see \"no reason\" why some accounts were changed.\nHowever he denied there was a deliberate attempt to withhold officers' accounts from the original public inquiry in 1989-90.\nNinety-six Liverpool fans died due to a crush at the match on 15 April 1989.\nMore than 600 police statements were internally reviewed by South Yorkshire Police (SYP), of which about 60 were amended between May 1989 and May 1990, the court heard.\nThe jury was shown how statements which contained comment on police leadership, lack of manpower and poor communications were altered.\nMr Denton, who had overall responsibility for the vetting of statements, told the inquests that removing criticism of senior officers was justified because it was \"very largely opinion\", whereas criticism of fans was seen as \"fact\".\nIn one statement, a sergeant at Hillsborough recalled that, in previous years, a group of police officers was stationed at a tunnel into the central pens at Sheffield Wednesday's stadium.\nThis part of his statement was crossed out and did not appear in later versions.\nMr Denton, who has now retired from SYP, said: \"I can't see any reason why this should have been taken out at all. That should have been left in.\"\nHe agreed it was \"not satisfactory\" that a reference to police radio problems, a year before the disaster, was also removed from another officer's statement.\n\"Because of the difficulties that were being experienced with the communications system there on the day [in 1989], I would have thought that should remain in,\" he added.\nMr Denton told the jury that SYP's legal advisors suggested the removal of comment, opinion and hearsay from officers' statements, even though it was allowed in the original Taylor public inquiry between 1989 and 1990.\nBut he admitted he was wrong to tell a previous inquiry all statement changes were suggested by lawyers and none by police.\nPete Weatherby QC, a barrister for 22 bereaved families, put it to him that key evidence about a police...\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:",

The lowest was in south-east England, where 13% of households were in this category.\nWorkless households are defined as homes where no-one aged from 16 to 64 is in employment. This could be because they are looking for work, or they have chosen not to work, or they are unable to work.\nPeople may choose not to work because of family commitments, early retirement or study. They may be unable to work because of sickness or disability.\nThe data shows that the number of workless households in the UK dropped by 182,000 over the year.\nThis means that 4.9 million people aged 16 to 64 lived in workless households. The ONS said this was the first time the figure had dropped below five million since 2008.\nSome 14% of all children in the UK, or 1.6 million, were living in these households. About two-thirds of them were in single-parent households.\nChildren's charities - Barnardo's and The Children's Society - said they welcomed the fact that the number of children living in workless households was falling.\nHowever, a move into work did not necessarily mean a move out of poverty, they argued.\nThey said it was imperative for the government to reduce childcare costs for families on low incomes.\nThe proportion of workless households was at its highest in 1996, when comparable records began, when it stood at 20.9% in the UK. This fell steadily to 17.3% in 2006 before rising to 19.2% in 2010. It has fallen relatively sharply in the past three years.\nIn 2013, there were 297,000 households in which no adult has ever worked, down 43,000 on the previous year.

McIlroy is due to start a crucial run of tournaments, while Wozniacki is playing the upcoming French Open.\"\nSpeaking at Wentworth on Wednesday, McIlroy said the decision to end the engagement had been mutual and amicable.\nHe said it was a difficult time, but that the move was best for both of them.\nMcIlroy won the US Open in 2011 and US PGA Championship the following year.\nWozniacki, who has reached the final of one grand slam tournament - the US Open in 2009 - is currently ranked 13th in the world.\nWhen McIlroy announced their engagement, he tweeted: \"I have a feeling it is going to be a great year.\"\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:",

He was one of my heroes growing up,\" said the 37-year-old.\n\"To come back to Southend, the club I'd supported as a boy, and finish it in that way was a dream come true.\"\nBarrett played 354 games in two spells with the club, the last against Stevenage in the EFL Trophy in November.\nThe former Bristol Rovers and Gillingham defender was a member of the Shrimpers' side that won back-to-back promotions from League Two to the Championship in 2005 and 2006, as well as the promotion in 2015.\n\"I'd never played at Wembley, I'd played at the Millennium Stadium a couple of times while Wembley was being rebuilt and I worried I'd missed my chance,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\"But to go to Wembley with Southend (against Wycombe), and the way we won it - Joe Pigott scored with 20 seconds to go to take it to penalties.\n\"I took a penalty, put my foot through it and smashed it in the roof of the net. To have all my family there, it was the cherry on the cake of my career.\"\nBarrett admitted he has been contemplating his future for the past 12 months, especially having \"always been a starter\" but finding himself out of the team.\n\"I still feel I've got more in me and could have carried on but it just felt the right time,\" he said. \"I'm extremely privileged to play over 700 career games, in successful teams and I've got lots of great memories.\n\"But unfortunately it comes to an end for all of us and this is my time.\"\nBarrett hopes to take his playing experience into coaching, adding: \"That's where I see my future, maybe management one day.\n\"I've had a few offers, but I'm just going to weigh my options. I'm completing my Uefa A licence at the moment and hopefully a good opportunity comes up for me.\"\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:",

Payments have to be made in cash, and prices are a matter of negotiation.\nBy contract, Go-Jek recruits and trains its staff, who get uniforms, helmets, and a smart phone on which they manage their pick ups.\nThe company also sets standard fare levels, and provides its drivers with insurance.\nGo-Jek now has no less than 10,000 riders on its books, based not just in Jakarta, but also across the cities of Bandung and Surabaya, and the island of Bali.\nThe company makes its money by taking a 20%...",
