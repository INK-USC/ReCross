Players need to understand that if they behave in a certain way they will be punished, and if they repeat their offence then the punishment will escalate.\nThat is where the idea of red and yellow cards comes in. It may sound radical but they said the same about bringing in coloured clothing 20 or so years back.\nThe exact working of the system would need more thought and discussion, but I would suggest a yellow card should be shown to a bowler for persistently abusing a batsman. I am not talking about sledging, but personal abuse and foul language that has no place in the game.\nThe card would result in them having to leave the field at the end of the over for a fixed period of time. If that bowler was in the middle of a great spell, or if the captain has a strategy based around him, it could be really harmful to the team. That evening, in the team meeting, the player could be singled out for having cost his side the game.\nIf a batsman is repeatedly wasting time, then the umpire could show him a yellow card, meaning he is is retired for an hour or until the next wicket falls. If a fielder misbehaves, he is demoted down the batting order, and so on.\nAnd if...\n\nSummary:",

On herself. On us. On Britain. For the sake of Britain,\" writes Norbert Koerzdoerfer in the tabloid Bild. \"German reunification was a tragedy for her: 'We've beaten the Germans twice and now they're back!' She was the first woman to break through Britain's old-boy-dominated society. She dismissed feminism - but thought women were stronger than men. She was hated. She was not loved. But she was admired.\"\nIn the news weekly Spiegel, Christoph Scheuermann calls Mrs Thatcher \"the great divider, who irrevocably smashed the British consensus around a convergent society, and split the country into right and left halves, into the haves and have-nots. Into those who can and those who should just give up, because there is no place for the unproductive.\" He adds: \"This rift still exists today. David Cameron's polemics against alleged spongers and layabouts are fed by a collective mistrust of anyone who depends on state handouts.\"\nA commentary by Thomas Schmid in Die Welt says: \"With aplomb she cut back the trade unions and woke the country from its royalist-socialist sleep. But for Thatcher - as for many - her greatest strength was also a weakness. She readied Britain for the capitalism of the financial markets, but also took her country closer to deindustrialisation. Eagle-eyed about attempts to inflate the EU into a superstate and its unctuous idealisation, she reined in the EU expansionists - but also discredited the EU in her own country.\" But, he concludes, \"like no other politician of the past century, she got by without jiggery-pokery, touchy-feeliness and collective pathos.

That includes the US, China, Japan and the UK.

Western Europe gets more than its share of the votes.\nHere are some examples: China's share of the global economy (using a measure known as purchasing power parity GDP) is 13.6%, but its share of the vote is 3.82%.\nThe UK and France each account for 2.9% of PPP GDP, but each has 4.3% of the vote.\nThe discrepancies are less marked if you use the main alternative to PPP, but they don't disappear.\nThe European Union (EU) has a total share of the vote of about a third.

Read more.\nMicrosoft has until now released a new version of Windows every few years.\nWindows 10 will be the last launch of this kind, the company said - from here on it will gradually update the software for free over months and years.\nMr Nadella said he hoped features like digital personal assistant Cortana - comparable to Apple's Siri, and Google Now - would set Windows 10 apart.\n\"I'm really excited about Cortana,\" he said.\n\"I think of it as [being] as profound as perhaps the PC operating system.\n\"If you think about our history in technology, we've had concepts that have changed how people have interacted with their computing resources.\n\"One of them was a graphical user interface, the second was the browser and the web. I think of Cortana as the third platform.\"\nSpeaking about possible privacy concerns, Mr Nadella took aim at companies like Google who use data to sell advertising.\n\"One of the foundational pieces of making anything more personal is trust,\" he said.\n\"We're not trying to sell you advertising, we're trying to in fact sell you software or devices so you as a user can trust it, that it's working on your behalf.\n\"I as a consumer may want to sometimes trade off my data to get a free service, and that's ok. But it's the other users of that same data - that is where trust matters.\n\"I absolutely want Microsoft to be trustworthy. How consumers make choices between companies,...\nSummary:",

They will not be going toe-to-toe, leaving themselves open and exchanging lots of big punches.\nThe worry for Wales is that Northern Ireland are really good at set-plays, and we conceded a few before the tournament started - including in our 1-1 friendly draw in March when Craig Cathcart scored for them from a corner.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThey are going to play a big part on Saturday too, because Northern Ireland will just sit back and wait for an opening. We just have to make sure we don't fall for it.\nWe will be working on defending free-kicks and corners during the week - but the most important thing during the game will be cutting them off at source.\nI think the stats will tell you that something like 65% of international games are decided on set-plays and, if you give away more than 16 free-kicks in your own half, you almost always concede from one of them.\nSo, we have to restrict their opportunities to single figures by not giving away fouls in those areas. The players will have to remember that when they are out on the pitch because it is set-pieces that are their best chance of scoring.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nGoing forward, it goes without saying that Gareth Bale could be the difference between the two sides.

That is why we have a clear fiscal plan to reduce our debts and build a stronger economy for every household.\"\nBut Ruth Gregory, economist at Capital Economics, said the figures were probably just a blip, as the deadline fell on a different day of the week from last year.\n\"Self-assessment receipts were boosted by the 31 July deadline falling on a Monday this year, but Sunday in 2016, meaning that some receipts were recorded in August last year,\" she said.\nShe pointed out that so far, borrowing was still some 9% higher than the \u00a320.9bn seen last year, with the OBR expecting this to worsen further.\n\"As such, despite July's strength, the chancellor may still find that he has little scope for any easing back on the planned fiscal squeeze in his November Budget.\"\nThe independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has forecast that public sector net borrowing will be \u00a358.3bn during the financial year ending March 2018.\nThe ONS data showed that total government debt, excluding public sector banks, stood at \u00a31.758 trillion at the end of July, which is equivalent to 87.5% of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:",

        "Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device\nIt's a remarkable prospect for a man who was contemplating giving up the game less than 12 months ago.\nAnd it's all the more remarkable considering he was rejected as a 16-year-old after being told he was \"too small\", and was playing non-league football as recently as May 2012.\nLast season - his first after his \u00a31m move from Fleetwood Town - was tough.\n2011/12 - Fleetwood Town:\nGoals 31, Appearances 36\n2012/13 - Leicester City:\nGoals 4, Appearances 26\n2013/14 (Up until March 15) - Leicester City:\nGoals 15, Appearances 33\nHe was struggling for confidence, not scoring, not reaching anywhere near the sort of form that prompted his move and getting plenty grief on social media.\nThe support of Foxes manager Nigel Pearson - the man who made Vardy the most expensive non-league player in history - and his assistant Craig Shakespeare convinced him to battle through the self-doubt, and the growing number of doubters.\n\"Yes I did [nearly give up] to be honest with you,\" Vardy told BBC Late Kick Off Midlands.\n\"But I had a few chats with the gaffer and they constantly told me I was good enough and they believed in me and stuck by me. I am glad to be showing the faith they showed in me on the pitch.\n\"I also know a lot of hard work has gone into it on my behalf as well as people believing in me. The gaffer has always said that he believes in me, even last year when I was at a bit of a low. And I am repaying him now.\n\"It was a big learning curve last year and I have done a lot of work in the off-season. I have come back this year fighting fit and it is paying dividends for me and the club.\"\nIt certainly is. This season, Vardy has scored 15 league goals in 33 games to help Leicester to the top of the Championship table.\nLast season he managed four in 26 league appearances.\n\"It was tough,\" Vardy recalled. \"I came into a dressing room with a lot of big names in and I wasn't used to it whatsoever.

In fancy, bespoke outfits and often in the media spotlight, Raisa's image contrasted with the tough reality of her crumbling communist country.\nNaina Yeltsin, the wife of Russia's first post-Soviet president, was less flamboyant than her predecessor, but still had a distinctive image and voice.\nBut with the dawning of the Putin era in Russian politics, there appears to have been a return to the camera-shy image of presidential wives in the Slavic-majority states.\nLyudmila Putin's low profile was in marked contrast to the global role played by her husband as president of Russia.\nShe did recently feature on the cover of a glossy magazine. But the three-times first lady was seen in public so rarely that her appearance at an awards ceremony in late March - her first since last year's inauguration ceremony - caused quite a stir in the Russian media.\nOne Russian independent journalist, Mikhail Fishman, went so far as to say that Mrs Putin's presence \"equals zero\". He suggested that having a family can help a ruler to be seen as open and down-to-earth, but that President Putin, an \"authoritarian...\n\n===\n\nWrite a summary of the text above :",

        "Lead workers, stonemasons, coppersmiths, glaziers and conservators have been busy sprucing up the centrepiece of the 11th Century Buckfast Abbey.\nThe church was rebuilt in 1932 but the entire abbey and grounds are getting a makeover to mark the abbey's millennium in 2018.\nRestoration of the church, with a new limestone floor, is costing about \u00a34m, according to the abbot, David Charlesworth.\nElsewhere, new workshops have been built, a terrace has been added to the restaurant and there are big plans to increase accommodation for visitors.\nIt is a huge turnaround from the 1980s when the monastery was in serious financial difficulties.\nAnd underpinning it all is the success of Buckfast Tonic Wine, which is made at the abbey.\n\"Clearly there were financial problems,\" said Abbot Charlesworth, 62, who has been at the abbey since he was a would-be monk aged 18.\n\"And there is no great fund in the Vatican that doles out money.\n\"A monastery is an independent entity which happens to be linked to Rome.\"\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, the monastery produced the tonic wine, but \"it was not the industry which it is today\", said the abbot.\nFrom a team of about 20 lay staff in the 1980s, the abbey now employs 123 across its shops, cafes, maintenance departments and a modern winery, opened two years ago.\nThe abbey's charitable trust, chaired by the abbot, is a 34% shareholder in the wine's seller, J Chandler and Co, and gets a royalty fee for every bottle sold.\nLast year the trust received \u00a36.6m, which includes income from other activities such as the shops, restaurant, a conference centre and accommodation.\nThe conference facilities are located in the abbey's former prep school, along with an interactive education centre that draws in 11,000 young visitors a year.\nThe conference centre is on the site of a former preparatory boarding school.\nA former monk and headmaster, Gregory Miller, 80, was given a suspended prison sentence earlier this year for making and possessing indecent images of children.\nThe abbey community at the...\n\n===\n\nWrite a summary of the text above :",

She claimed her legislation could save lives.\n\"That's what the bill is about.

        "\"An acquired disability is a crazy thing, it's a life-changing experience, it undermines everything you thought you were, all your values,\" Nick Beighton says.\nThe para-kayaker was an officer in the army when he trod on an Improvised Explosive Device in 2009 and his life changed completely. He lost both legs above the knee and broke his pelvis, but the changes went much deeper than that.\nAt 6ft 7in, and athletic and strong, he struggled to adjust to life with a disability.\n\"I always wanted to be viewed as someone who was capable of doing what he needed to do and just get on and do it and not be vulnerable.\"\nSuddenly, though, he felt very vulnerable he says, an alien concept to him because of his job, his athleticism and his competence. He struggled for a long time, and acknowledging that he now needed to ask for help was the hardest bit.\nHe hadn't really processed these feelings before the London 2012 Paralympics, hadn't really \"come to terms\" with his disability and how it had impacted on his identity. But he found and enjoyed para-rowing and trained hard to make the games with rowing partner Samantha Scothern. Unfortunately they finished fourth, only a fraction of a second outside the medals.\nBeighton says that London 2012 was a whirlwind and he realises now that he threw himself into sport to prevent him from dealing with his disability. It was a \"protective approach\", he says, \"where I could focus on something I could control and manage rather than the stuff I couldn't.\"\nAfter the games, and the difficult defeat, came a lot of soul-searching and coming to terms, truly, with his new reality.\nHe no longer lives in denial, waking up thinking he is in a bad dream, he says.  Para-kayaking has been a big part of that. Now training and competing is as much about being happy with who he is and how he approaches life as it is about sport.\nWhen Beighton goes out and competes in Rio, this internal growth won't be evident.

Something had changed, something was wrong.\nOn Tuesday, those hunches were confirmed in the most dramatic of circumstances when Liebherr replaced the Italian and installed herself as chairman. But many were left asking 'why?'\nThis was not an argument over transfer funds, wages or the need for investment. This was not a snap decision or a row that had flared up suddenly. Cortese was not tempted by offers from abroad or new challenges.\nNo, the dispute that ended his five-year spell at Southampton was about the sale of the club.\nThe problems began at the end of last season and although an uneasy truce was reached in May, by the time the season had begun, it was clear all was not well. Liebherr, who was left the club by her father Marcus following his sudden death in 2010, had no interest in Southampton and no knowledge of football - she wanted to sell the club.\nCortese was open to that, but his preference for a sale in two or three years was at odds with Liebherr's desire for an immediate sale.\nThe 'why' is incidental now. The focus has instead turned to what it might mean for the club, the manager and their players.\nThe bond between Cortese and Pochettino is well publicised. The former Swiss banker had been on a scouting mission on the continent when the sheer enthusiasm and passion of a manager on the touchline below caught his eye.\nSix months passed, during which time thorough research was conducted on the Argentine, and when the time came to replace previous manager Nigel Adkins, Cortese knew exactly who he wanted.\nWithin moments of their first meeting, both men knew the...\nThis boils down to the simple idea that",

It believes that accounts for about one third of all pupils in England, but this calculation is a work in progress.\nThere is no official definition of an \"ordinary working family\" but Ms Greening said on the Today Programme: \"They don't perhaps qualify for free school meals - for pupil premium - but actually they are growing up in families that are below median incomes.\"\nThe household earning the median income is the one for which half of families have a higher income and half have lower.\nThe Pupil Premium is a pot of money set aside for children who are in care, eligible for free school meals or have had free school meals at any point in the last six years.\nPupils are eligible for free school meals if their family is on one of a range of benefits or has a household income of less than \u00a316,190.\nSo, if earning above \u00a316,190 puts you at the bottom end of the \"ordinary working families\" definition, how is the government defining the top end of the range?\nThe paper published on Wednesday included the first attempt by government statisticians to come up with figures that set out how many children from different income brackets go to grammar schools.\nIn the past, the only figures to help with this have been those covering how many children eligible for pupil premium go to particular schools, so expanding these statistics is an ambitious project.\nWhat the statisticians have done is to attempt to match individual pupils in schools with their families' income through looking at tax payments and tax credits details.\nThese figures have then been adjusted to take into account things like household size, because if there are two families with identical household incomes, one of which has one child and the other has four children, their standards of living will not be the same.\nTaking all these adjustments into account, the median household income comes out as \u00a320,000....\n\nTL;DR:",

Let us consider, dispassionately, as always, the competing arguments.\nFirstly, the formula named after Joel Barnett does not generally draw comparisons between Scotland and the other devolved territories of the UK.\nIt predicates a sum spent upon government departments in England and applies two factors.

        "The outlook for traditional newspapers - including News UK's Sun and Times - has looked bleak for some time, with online revenues failing to compensate for declining physical sales.\nAnd in the past few years, the online sphere has also seen a structural shift away from individual news websites, to the sharing of news stories via Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites.\nSo Mrs Brooks rejoins Mr Murdoch's British newspaper operation at a time of falling profits amid this increased competition.\nIn June 2014, News UK (or News Corp UK & Ireland, to give it its formal title) reported a 12-month operating loss of \u00c2\u00a33.5m. This came after a \u00c2\u00a351m profit for the year before.\nMeanwhile, annual profits at the Sun had almost halved.\nMrs Brooks has \"got her work cut out,\" says Charlie Beckett, journalism professor at the London School of Economics.\nIt was back in 2011 that Mrs Brooks resigned from her previous time at the helm of News UK in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. She was put on trial, only to be cleared of all four charges in June of last year.\nRecently she has been working for a News Corp-owned video news agency.\nProf Beckett says that since Mrs Brooks' resignation: \"I suspect she has been taking a keen interest in digital strategy.\n\"Online is where you have to build your brand and audiences, and the expectation is that it is going to get harder.\"\nMrs Brooks will no doubt be looking to see what other news organisations have recently done, such as doing deals with Facebook or Apple.\nCurrently Facebook is trialling a deal with news organisations - including the BBC - to publish some of their content directly rather than simply hosting it on their own websites.\nThe news groups taking part are BBC News, The Guardian, BuzzFeed, the New York Times, National Geographic, NBC News, The Atlantic, Spiegel and Bild.

Techniques such as nerve grafts, which worked in the arms and legs, had shown limited success with the spinal cord, doctors at the Case Western Reserve University said.\nThe spinal cord scars after it is damaged, and molecules - chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans - prevent nerves repairing and forming new connections.\nSource: Spinal Research\nThe researchers used a nerve graft to form a bridge across the scar at the same time as injecting an enzyme - chondoitinase ABC - which attacked the inhibitory molecules.\nThree months later, tests showed the mice had recovered 80-100% of breathing function.\nProfessor of neuroscience and lead researcher Jerry Silver said: \"The use of the enzyme, that's helped get the nerve fibres out and we were amazed at, once they get out, how well they can reconnect.\n\"The spinal cord can just figure things out and restore really beautiful functional breathing patterns.\"\nResearchers hope to begin trials in humans. They are also investigating whether bladder function can be restored, which can be lost when the lower spine is damaged.\nDr Mark Bacon, from the charity Spinal Research, said: \"Long distance regeneration has remained quite elusive in the field of spinal cord injury repair, so to achieve this and at the end of it establish functional connections that actually do something useful - restore breathing - is remarkable.\n\"It is potentially life-changing if this or similar techniques can be translated to the clinic.\"\n\n===\n\nGiven the above document, write one sentence to summarize:",

Fashion has long been criticised as frivolous and superficial, dictating trends that are swiftly cast aside.\nIndeed, watching the crowds teetering on vertiginous heels, heads topped with designer sunglasses, arms toting handbags and hands clutching smartphones, it is easy to understand why.\nYet while it may look like a big party to outsiders, the week is a crucial one for the industry.\n\"It is incredibly important because it's the showcase of the very best of British businesses to an international audience,\" says Caroline Rush, chief executive of the British Fashion Council.\n\"The British fashion industry is exceeding the current economic growth we are seeing in the UK - because we are exporting all over the world.\"\nThe fashion sector plays a significant role in the UK economy - it generates \u00a326bn for the UK each year, rakes in \u00a310.7bn from consumers and supports almost 800,000 jobs.\nLondon Fashion Week is a crucial element in this, as orders of approximately \u00a3100m are placed during the five days -  and the shows are watched online by audiences in 190 countries worldwide.\nThe spectacular clothes worn by models on the catwalk can appear impractical, unaffordable and sometimes ridiculous. So will they really affect what we wear, come September?\nTraditionally, the idea has been that the clothes and styles adopted by the richest in society eventually filter through and influence the rest of us, the so-called \"trickle-down\" theory - first put forward by the American economist and sociologist, Thorstein Veblen, in 1898.\nIt is true that since the social upheavals of the 1960s, an inverse process has evolved, whereby designers have been...\n\nSummary:",

        "Elements of the malicious software used in Friday's attacks were part of a treasure trove of cyber-attack tools leaked by hacking group the Shadow Brokers in April.\nOne of the tools contained in the Shadow Brokers leak, codenamed EternalBlue, proved to be \"the most significant factor\" in the spread of Friday's global attack, according to cyber-security firm Kaspersky Lab.\nThe tool was said to have been created by the NSA - though, as is typical, the agency has neither confirmed nor denied this.\nEternalBlue was made public on 14 April, and while Microsoft had fixed the problem a month prior to its leak, it appeared many high-profile targets had not updated their systems to stay secure.\nFriday's attack has reignited the debate over whether or not governments should disclose vulnerabilities they have discovered or bought on the black market.\n\"It would be deeply troubling if the NSA knew about this vulnerability but failed to disclose it to Microsoft until after it was stolen,\" said Patrick Toomey, a lawyer working for the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\"These attacks underscore the fact that vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and criminals around the world.\n\"Patching security holes immediately, not stockpiling them, is the best way to make everyone's digital life safer.\"\nEdward Snowden, who famously leaked many internal NSA files in June 2013, criticised the NSA on Friday in a series of tweets.\n\"In light of today's attack, Congress needs to be asking [the NSA] if it knows of any other vulnerabilities in software used in our hospitals,\" he wrote.\n\"If [the NSA] had privately disclosed the flaw used to attack hospitals when they found it, not when they lost it, this may not have happened.\"\nHowever, others focused the blame at institutions for being too slow in updating their systems, given that this attack happened almost two months after a (free) fix was made available by Microsoft.\n\"Say what you want to say about the NSA or disclosure process,\" said Zeynep Tufeki,...\nHow would you rephrase that in a few words?",

        "The ex-EastEnders actress was in a pantomime in the Suffolk town when the murders were taking place.\nThe bodies of five women - all of them sex workers - were found near Ipswich over a 10-day period.\nDobson can clearly recall the atmosphere in the town. \"The streets were deserted. You could walk home and not see a soul. The theatre got taxis to get the chorus girls home.\n\"It was very hard to get people to see a happy, family Christmas show when those poor prostitutes were being murdered.\n\"Once they'd found [the killer, Steve Wright], the streets filled up and people spilled on to them with a great sense of relief and joy.\"\nThe film is based on the 2011 hit stage musical at the National Theatre. Dobson plays June - one of the residents of London Road, who were shocked to find a serial killer was living in the community.\nThe ensemble cast includes Olivia Colman, Tom Hardy, Rosalie Craig and Kate Fleetwood.\nThe film reunites the stage musical's original team - writer Alecky Blythe, musician Adam Cork and director Rufus Norris.\nWhat makes London Road unusual is that it tells its story using only real dialogue spoken by people in Ipswich at the time, set to a musical score.\nBlythe, who specialises in verbatim theatre, had gone to the town in the winter of 2006 after hearing reports that a serial killer was at large. The voices she recorded included those of local residents, sex workers and members of the media who reported the story and the subsequent murder trial.\nShe found a focus for the story when she read a local newspaper report about a resident, Julie (played by Colman), who had organised a floral competition on London Road in the aftermath of the murders.\nThroughout the film shoot, Blythe ensured the actors kept to her verbatim script, which included all the original verbal tics.\n\"It's quite an odd form of theatre but strangely exhilarating,\" says Dobson. \"When you've cracked it you feel very proud of yourself.\n\"It has a strange rhythm to it because you don't just say the dialogue - you include every cough...\nThis boils down to the simple idea that",

They were admirably open in their press release announcing Glock's departure that pay drivers were part of their business model.\nOne of the sport's greatest, Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio, was a five-time world champion in the 1950s, but he would probably never have made it to Europe without the backing of Juan Peron's government.\nWhat their news release said was that previously they felt they could manage with one pay driver and one salaried, with external sponsorship making up the budget.\nThat one pay driver this year was initially planned to be Englishman Max Chilton. However promising Chilton is, there is no secret that part of the reason he is there is his financial backing.\nBut now, Marussia said, the global economic downturn had changed things.  External sponsorship was proving harder to come by and that meant they could no longer afford Glock's salary.\nGlock introduced sponsors to the team, but his salary was significantly greater than what they paid. Chilton owes his drive to the fact that his 'salary' is far less than the income from the sponsors he brings with him.\nThere has been an outpouring of sympathy for Glock's predicament from his colleagues.\nMcLaren's Jenson Button, a world champion, and Red Bull's Mark Webber, a multiple race winner, were among those who sent messages of condolence and best wishes to Glock on the social networking site Twitter.\nGlock might not be in the same league as leading names such as Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel, but he was good enough to finish on the podium three times, among other strong performances, in his two years with the Toyota team in...\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:",

It's the kind of easily-digestible length that can be read over a cup of coffee.\nThe two main themes are, of course, a withdrawal from the EU (UKIP would hold a referendum as soon as possible) and dealing with concerns over immigration (for the record the latest figure we have for annual net migration in Wales is 6,500).\nArguably, the most significant result of the emergence of UKIP in recent years has been the fact that all of the parties are now addressing immigration in a way they have never done in previous general elections.\nUKIP says there should be no immigration for unskilled jobs for five years and immigrants should only gain access to the NHS and welfare after five years of paying tax.\nA key question is whether pledges like these give them enough of a point of difference, when the other parties are offering variations on the same theme.\nThe big policy for Wales is a pledge to make up any loss in regional aid it would suffer as a result of a UK withdrawal from the EU.\nThis deals with a question journalists always put to the UKIP leader in Wales, Nathan Gill, that Wales will inevitably lose out because it is a net beneficiary of being in the EU.\nDealing with concerns over immigration is something that filters its way through the entire manifesto.\nOn housing, for example, social housing would only be available to those with local connections, and the various government schemes set up to help those get onto the property ladder would also only be available to British people.\nThere's also some populist measures, such as re-instating weekly bin collections and things like \"provide best value for money for council tax payers by cutting council costs\".\nHousing and local government are devolved but, like the other parties, the manifesto is full of policies that apply at a...\n\n===\n\nWrite a summary of the text above :",

But even if they win their remaining matches, they will have won the league with fewer points than any of the previous five winners.\nTheir success, of course, has owed much to striker Jamie Vardy, the Football Writers' Footballer of the Year and PFA Player of the Year Riyad Mahrez, who have proved themselves a deadly combination, particularly when it comes to scoring goals.\nAnd setting them up...\nIt also helped that manager Claudio Ranieri - previously nicknamed 'The Tinkerman' for his methods during his time at Chelsea - regularly named the same starting XI.

It might be the right cause, but is it the right statistic?\nNot quite, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), which provides data on the sector for the government and funding agencies.\nThe comparison, according to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, was based on there being \"2,644 young black British men aged 18-25 in prison\".\nThese were contrasted with young male black students in Russell Group universities.\nBut HESA says that in 2013-14 there were 2,655 black students from the UK, under the age of 25 in this group of leading universities. Among under-30s, the number was higher, 3,040.\nThe following year, 2014-15, the figures were higher again, with 3,430 male black students under-30 and 3,040 who were under-25.\nThe Russell Group says there were 4,520 black British male students at their universities in 2013-14 and they were more likely to have a slightly older age profile than white students.\nIn either case, it would mean there were not more young black men in prison than in these universities.\nDowning Street says that HESA is the source for their figure too, but interpret the numbers as 2,315 young black male students in Russell Group universities, lower than HESA's own definitive figure.\nOf course none of this takes away from the bigger picture highlighting the lack of black students in top universities.\nAs Mr Cameron wrote: \"It's striking that in 2014, our top university, Oxford, accepted just 27 black men and women out of an intake of more than...\n\nNow, can you write me an extremely short abstract for it?",

Studies have shown that taking out just a few large items each year can help us get on top of the problem.\"\nDr Reed's proposal is for a barbed spear about 30cm in length.  It would be mounted on a \"chaser satellite\" that would edge to within 100m of a junk object.\nPictures sent to the ground would then be used to assess the target, before the chaser was moved to within perhaps 20m to take a shot.\nOnce the harpoon is hooked through the skin of the rogue satellite or rocket stage, the chaser could either pull on a trailing polymer cord itself or deploy a separate thruster unit to do the job of dragging the aimless drifter towards Earth.\nThis is research in its very early stages. The BBC has filmed firing tests of a prototype harpoon at Astrium UK's Stevenage base.\nThe company, the largest space manufacturer in Europe, is also pursuing other ideas at its centres in France and Germany.  These concepts involve nets and robotic grappling devices.  All systems have their pros and cons.\nHarpoons could deal well with a satellite that is tumbling, for example, but the approach has its critics because of the fear it could actually add to our problems in space.\n\"Historically, one of the great sources of debris has been the explosion of fuel tanks in spent rocket stages,\" explained Dr Reed.\n\"We...\nThis boils down to the simple idea that",

Also, if you get a call or text from an Uber driver, it's done through Twilio in order to not divulge real numbers.\nTwilio is also one of the tech industry's so-called \"unicorns\" - the much-mocked term given to start-ups that are valued at over $1bn (\u00c2\u00a3700m).\nThe valuations are sometimes considered absurd. Companies that barely have any assets, let alone profits, can become unicorns on the basis of a big investment.\nThe most striking recent example is perhaps Uber. Here's a transportation company that owns no cars, employs zero drivers*, and is reportedly looking at a yearly loss of well over a billion dollars.\nBut it's the idea of Uber that is thriving. Much like one of its journeys on a Friday night, the value of the company is surging. Last month, the Saudi government invested $3.5bn in Uber - a company now considered to be worth a staggering $62.5bn.\nIt's shaky ground, and one that's only really tested when a company takes the leap onto Wall Street - although even then you could argue it's just moving from one pot of speculative money into the next.\nThere has been something of a tech IPO drought of late.

        "My college roommate asked me what this article means:\n\nThe High Court on Wednesday found Australia's policy of sending asylum seekers to government-funded offshore processing centres was constitutional.\nThe decision means people, including 37 babies, face deportation to the detention centre on Nauru.\nThe Anglican Dean of Brisbane Dr Peter Catt said they would likely face trauma and abuse if deported.\n\"This fundamentally goes against our faith so our church community is compelled to act, despite the possibility of individual penalty against us,\" Dr Catt said in a statement.\n\"Historically churches have afforded sanctuary to those seeking refuge from brutal and oppressive forces.\"\nTen Anglican and Uniting churches are offering sanctuary, including Brisbane Cathedral.\nIan Rintoul of the Refugee Action Coalition welcomed the move, but said it would be largely symbolic as only about 30 of the asylum seekers were in the community and able to attend a church. The rest are in detention centres.\nThe churches' offer comes as pressure builds on Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to allow the group to remain in Australia.\nMr Dutton told the Australian Broadcasting Corp that no child would be \"put in harm's way\".\n\"We are going to work individually through each of the cases,\" he said.\nAustralia intercepts all boats bringing suspected asylum seekers to its territory and takes those on board to Nauru or to Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.\nEven if they are found to be genuine refugees they will not be allowed to settle in Australia.\nThe government says the policy deters people smuggling and saves lives at sea, but it has been widely criticised as breaking Australia's legal obligations.\nThe announcement that the Anglican Church is to offer sanctuary to the asylum seekers affected by this week's High Court ruling has attracted widespread media coverage.\nBut it is a largely symbolic gesture.\nThe vast majority of the 268 people now faced with being forced to return to Nauru have been locked up in mainland Australian detention centres pending the High Court decision.\nIn other words,...\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:",

        "First, please read the article below.\n\nFrom \"Why do Oakham's stocks have five holes?\" to \"What are the origins of the word nesh?\"\nHere's how we have got on with answering your questions.\nThis had our writers flummoxed at first but probably because they're not originally from these parts. It seems to be used in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, Yorkshire and Lancashire to describe someone who feels cold or is a bit of a wimp.\nLinguistics expert at Nottingham Trent University, Dr Natalie Braber said it is often difficult to know exactly where local words come from.\nThe word is said to derive from the Old English word hnesce meaning feeble, weak or infirm.\nAnd according to the Oxford English Dictionary it is thought to originate from the Dutch word nesch or nisch meaning soft or damp.\nIt was first used in a document in the Lindisfarne Gospels written between 500 and 900AD.\nA quick call to the local museum revealed they didn't know, so the research net had to be cast a little wider. and eventually an answer was found.\n\"Five hole stocks are not uncommon although not many now survive,\" according to Dr Sarah Richardson from the University of Warwick.\nShe added: \"Five hole stocks originate from Roman times when the arms, legs and head were confined which was more a form of torture than a shaming punishment.\"\n\"More likely with the Oakham example is that juveniles or women could have both legs confined to one hole so they could not wriggle free. Sometimes men were also confined by one leg alone.\"\nDr Richardson believes more than one man could be detained at a time, probably on alternative sides.\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was a document created in the 9th Century, recording the history of the peoples of England.\nAn extract from 924 reads: \"This year, before midsummer, went King Edward with an army to Nottingham; and ordered the town to be repaired on the south side of the river, opposite the other, and the bridge over the Trent betwixt the two towns.\"\nProf John Beckett, from the University of Nottingham, has said, however, that this probably...\n\nNow, can you write me an extremely short abstract for it?",

I won and get to come back against Venus Williams, which is a bit of a childhood dream - I grew up watching her play.\n\"But as a competitor, I'm just really looking forward to the challenge. She's a multi Grand Slam champion for a reason.\"\nKonta has been a study in serenity over recent months, calmly seeing off the likes of Garbine Muguruza, Victoria Azarenka, Andrea Petkovic and now Halep, among others.\nIt is a far cry from the player who, until her run to the US Open fourth round earlier this month, had only won one match in the main draw of a Grand Slam.\nThe improvement has come since the Lawn Tennis Association cut her funding last year, prompting Konta to relocate her training base to northern Spain under the guidance of coaches Esteban Carril and Jose-Manuel Garcia.\n\"Her ability to play has always been there,\" said former British number one Anne Keothavong.\n\"She's always had a good serve, a great backhand, and she's always been a good athlete.\n\"She's been playing much better but I think the mental side is huge for a tennis player, and that's what makes the difference between those right at the top and those in the middle.\"\nLondon-based Spaniard Juan Coto became the name on everyone's lips in New York...\nSummary:",

Never has a national museum reopened to such scenes of fervency. The restored, extended and rejigged Rijksmuseum is a triumph of curatorial intelligence and sensitivity.\nOnce again - at last - the world can experience the richness of the greatest art tradition ever produced by a tiny, sea-hemmed nation: from Vermeer to Van Gogh, Rembrandt to Mondrian.\nThe Dutch capital is cleaning up its act. Brothels and cannabis cafes are being closed. But the most significant transformation is the renovation of the Rijksmuseum. Stand in front of the Rijksmuseum's charcoal-painted walls and look again at those Golden Age pictures of church interiors and you will find depictions of dogs cavorting, gallants chatting up maids and market stalls trading within the house of God. There will always be many shades of grey in Amsterdam.\nThe Rijksmuseum will reach places that other art collections do not. Such as your heart.\nThe long winter of discontented tourists is over. The Night Watch is back in its rightful place at the head of the Gallery of Honour. The rejuvenated Rijksmuseum is back at the heart of Amsterdam, and it is time that you came back to this most creative of cities, which decorates the map of Europe so elegantly.\nThe Rijksmuseum is a showcase of what this country can do when it really wants something great. Work is not yet finished; this is merely the beginning of a new era for the museum.\nAfter 10 years of comprehensive renovations, the Rijksmuseum\u2014the Dutch national museum of art and history, where masterpieces by Rembrandt van Rijn and Johannes Vermeer mingle with 17th-century...",

The average payment was $1,780.\nJack Whitton describes so-called bug hunting as a hobby. He has also identified weaknesses in platforms run by Paypal, Microsoft, Dropbox and Snapchat among others.\n\"It can take a day to find, then more to investigate whether it's a real issue,\" he told the BBC.\nHis most recent find involved an image that could be embedded with malicious code, which would enable its owner to take over a Facebook account once a particular member had clicked on it - a vulnerability known as cross-site scripting.\nIt would not have affected the user's computer, but would have enabled their account to be accessed and controlled remotely - including sending private messages, posting links and pictures.\n\"No-one had actually exploited it,\" Mr Whitton said.\n\"Facebook were pretty pleased. They managed to get a quick fix - within six hours. They are a great company to report bugs to, they take it seriously.\"\nA permanent fix took longer, which is why he is only now able to talk about the bug although he found it last year.\nThe social network has also included Jack Whitton in its \"hall of fame\" - a list of white hat - or ethical - hackers who have helped it to make the platform more secure.\nHowever, potential bug hunters should choose their websites carefully, he added.\n\"Firms are becoming more aware that every company has issues, if you don't let people report them, the bad guys will use them and you just won't know about it,\" he said.\n\"It's fun to find these things -...\nThis boils down to the simple idea that",

A vote to leave would put all of this at risk.\"\nInternational Women's Day has been held on 8 March every year since 1913, and has been recognised by the United Nations since 1975.\nThe UN says it's a time to reflect on progress made, to call for change and to celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities.\nThe theme of this year's day is \"Planet 50-50 by 2030\" - aiming to achieve global equality in areas such as education and end all forms of discrimination.\nFive images that reveal how women are treated\nBBC Trending: Are Saudi women really that oppressed?\nIn pictures: Women making technology work for them\nWhy...\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:",

He said such an attack \"strikes at the heart of our very democracy\".\nColgan pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances - namely a blast bomb, and to six charges of communicating false information causing a bomb hoax. He also admitted a further four counts of placing an article causing a bomb hoax.\nColgan was linked by  forensic evidence to a crude bomb left at a Catholic church, and linked to a bomb at an Iceland store via a text message he sent that said: \"We done (sic) Iceland for a laugh.\"\nColgan was arrested on 4 March and when his home was searched mobile phones were handed over that linked him to some of the hoax bomb calls.\nA prosecutor said other information on the phones - such as texts and pictures of the emergency services attending at some scenes - indicated Colgan \"got a kick out of the volume of disruption he caused\".\nA defence barrister said two years has passed since the incidents, and in that time Colgan has shown \"a degree of insight and remorse\" and has not committed any further offending - proving he was a \"young man who is capable of staying out of...",

And although there is plenty of evidence to suggest the Universe is awash with these ripples, so far no actual detection has been made \u2013 either here on Earth or in space.\nIt's not for want of trying, but the signal is expected to be very faint, even from the biggest sources.\n\"Gravitational waves are essentially the mechanism that carries the force of gravity through the Universe,\" explained Esa's Lisa Pathfinder project scientist, Dr Paul McNamara.\n\"They are produced by very large, violent events in the Universe \u2013 things like galaxies merging, where super-massive black holes in those galaxies come together.

No trial date has been set.\nMr Cosby has maintained that all of the encounters were consensual.\nDuring the hearing, Mr Cosby's lawyer had a heated exchanged with the judge over police reading a statement from the accuser, Andrea Constand.\nBrian McMonagle, one of Mr Cosby's lawyers, argued that Ms Constand, who lives in Toronto, should have testified in person and called her statement \"hearsay\".\n\"I told him, 'I can't talk, Mr Cosby'. I started to panic,\" Ms Constand said in the statement.\nShe described how Mr Cosby allegedly sexually violated her after giving her three blue pills. She said the pills made her dizzy and made her legs \"like jelly\".\nMr Cosby said in a statement read in court that she never told him to stop during the encounter.\nMore than 40 women have accused Mr Cosby of sexual assault, but in nearly all of the cases too much time has elapsed for charges to be pursued.\nThe Constand case is unusual in that it fell within the statute of limitations for charges.\nHe is facing civil lawsuits in other states over the other accusations. Mr Cosby is free on $1m bail.\nMr Cosby is best known for his role as the father in the television hit The Cosby Show which ran from 1984 to 1992 and was a huge hit in the US and around the globe.\nIt made the comedian one of America's most popular entertainers.\nThe comedian, once the highest paid US television star, could go to prison for 10 years if convicted.\nMs Constand has said that she came to think of Mr Cosby as a \"mentor and a friend\" before she said he made unwanted sexual advances.\nShe went to visit him at his home in 2004 where she said he drugged and sexually assaulted her.\nA criminal complaint unsealed last year details the encounter.\nProsecutors allege that the victim protested when Mr Cosby offered her a glass of wine, saying she had not...\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:",

Didn't Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi all say that he was doing a bad job?\nIndeed there are plenty of quotes from top Senate Democrats expressing dismay bordering on disgust with the way Mr Comey handled the FBI investigation into Mrs Clinton's email server.\nHowever, most of those quotes date back to November 2016. Six months are an eternity in politics, and in the ensuing time Mr Comey has become the face of the FBI's investigation into possible ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.\nWhile many Democrats may not have been thrilled with Mr Comey, over the past few months they've come to view him as one of the few individuals independent enough to challenge the president.\nHow will his successor be appointed? Will the Trump administration be the ones to dictate the position?\nDonald Trump has the power to fire the director of the FBI, and he's the one who gets to hire the replacement. But it's a high-level political appointment, so whoever he picks has to be confirmed by a majority vote in the 100-seat US Senate.\nGiven that there are currently 52 Republicans there, as long as Mr Trump's party sticks together, Democrats will be unable to block whoever Mr Trump chooses as the nation's next top law enforcement officer.\nThe system is set up to insulate FBI directors from politics. They serve 10-year terms, which means their tenure is supposed to overlap multiple presidents. The last time an FBI director was fired mid-term was back in 1993. It's a rare occurrence that is fraught with political peril.\nCan Mr Comey speak freely now he is out of office about these events in any subsequent hearing? Is...",

Julie rang the police, then her husband at work.\nOver the next few weeks, residents and hundreds of police officers fanned out across the neighbourhood; bloodhounds were brought in from out of the city; Soho printers donated fliers with Etan's photograph, printed in English, Spanish, Chinese, Yiddish and Italian.\nEventually, the flurry of interest died down, and the neighbourhood settled back into its rhythms.\nJulie and Stan Patz focused on raising their daughter Shira, eight, and Ari, two. But they also began a campaign to patch up the shortcomings in a system they believed had contributed to the failure to find their son.\nThe couple called for a national fingerprint database, and for federal laws requiring parents to notify their schools when their children are to be absent, and for schools to notify parents if their child does not show up.\n''We lost eight hours that way,'' Julie Patz later said.\nBecause of the parents' efforts, missing children's photographs began appearing on milk cartons - with Etan's face one of the first to feature - shopping bags, buses, and elsewhere.\n''If it makes...\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:",

        "Summarize this document: Yet that world was imagined not by a contemporary writer but by the Edwardian author Edward Morgan Forster.\nBest known for his novels about class and hypocrisy - Howards End, A Room With A View and A Passage To India - The Machine Stops was Forster's only foray into science fiction.\nPublished in 1909, it tells the story of a mother and son - Vashti and Kuno - who live in a post-apocalyptic world where people live individually in underground pods, described as being \"like the cell of a bee\", and have their needs provided for by the all-encompassing Machine.\nIt is a world where travel is rare, inhabitants communicate via video screens, and people have become so reliant on the Machine that they have begun to worship it as a living entity.\nNeil Duffield, who adapted the story for York Theatre Royal's stage, says it is \"quite extraordinary\" how much modern technology it predicts - and how sharply it observes the effects it will have on users.\n\"He predicts the internet in the days before even radio was a mass medium.\n\"It would have all seemed so far-fetched back in that time, when people weren't even used to telephones - and that makes it more relevant now than it was in his time - he was anticipating technology like the internet and Skype.\n\"And he predicts, with astonishing accuracy, the effect the technology has on our relations with one another, with our bodies, with our philosophy and culture.\n\"It's a warning for now for what we might be getting ourselves into.\"\nThe play's director, Juliet Forster (no relation), brought the story to Duffield for him to turn into a play.\nShe says she became enthralled by it in the late 1980s and \"year on year, it's gained more and more relevance\".\n\"It's so eerily true and resonant. Very quickly I thought it was something that could be very interesting. Although he predicts all that technology, what's more interesting is how human beings react to it - that's what fascinates me.\n\"Forster had such insight into human nature and the way we would adapt and lose parts of ourselves...\nSummary:",

        "First, please read the article below.\n\nMonday 18 June 1984 was the most violent day of the year-long miners' strike.\nThousands of pickets met huge lines of police - who were brought in from all around the country - outside the Orgreave coke works near Rotherham.\nThe miners wanted to stop lorry loads of coke leaving for the steelworks. They thought that would help them win their strike, and help protect their pits and their jobs. The police were determined to hold them back.\nThere was violence from both sides.\nThe debate goes on about who acted first, but police horses were sent to charge the crowd up the field and officers followed to make arrests. Many miners and police officers were injured.\nThe pictures of miners and police officers fighting shocked TV viewers.\nThe number of officers was unprecedented. The use of dogs, horses and riot gear in an industrial dispute was almost unheard of. Some of the tactics were learned from the police in Northern Ireland and Hong Kong who had experience dealing with violent disorder.\nDuring the subsequent court case a police manual was uncovered which set out the latest plans to deal with pickets and protests.\nPolice vans and Range Rovers were fitted with armour so they could withstand the stones being thrown by some in the crowd. The miners suspected the whole operation was being run under government control.\nMany believe Orgreave was the first example of what became known as \"kettling\" - the deliberate containment of protesters by large numbers of police officers. It marked a turning point in policing and in the strike.\nIt was the moment the police strategy switched from defensive - protecting collieries, coking plants and working miners - to offensive, actively breaking up crowds and making large numbers of arrests. In many mining communities faith in the police was destroyed, a legacy that lasts to this day.\nThere were questions in court about the reliability of the police evidence. Many of the statements made by officers were virtually identical. At least one had a forged signature.\nEventually the case was...\n\nNow, can you write me an extremely short abstract for it?",

But East Timor remained on its books as a former Portuguese colony still awaiting self-determination, and that lack of formal recognition continued to haunt Indonesian rule.\nSo can the UN now leave East Timor with its head held high? Compared to the messy outcome of many other UN interventions, East Timor is a relative success story. An impoverished, war-torn country has, in 13 years, become a fairly stable small state with promising economic growth prospects.\nHow much of that was down to the UN, and how much down to the efforts of East Timorese leaders like Jose Ramos Horta, is a matter of debate. No-one would dispute that the UN's assistance has at times been vital.\nFinn Reske-Nielsen, chief of the UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (Unmit), said in a statement: \"The Timorese people and its leaders have shown courage and unswerving resolve to overcome great challenges.\n\"Although there remains much work ahead, this is an historic moment in recognising the progress already made.\"\nHe said the withdrawal did not mark an end to the partnership between the UN...\n\nSummary:",

Workers have complained that the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour isn't enough to live on. That's why they chose today - tax filing day - to highlight that people who work are forced to rely on public assistance.\nEmployers are beginning to respond to the ongoing protests. Walmart, McDonald's and others have recently said that they will raise their minimum pay to $9 per hour. But, workers are after more.\nAt present, 42% of US workers make less than $15 per hour. Half of African Americans, 55% of women and nearly 60% of Latinos make less than $31,000 annually.\nA study by the University of California at Berkeley finds that nearly three-fourths of all recipients of public assistance are from households where at least one member works. The researchers conclude that it's costing the US government $152bn per year in public support to make up for the shortfall in income from private sector work.\nIn just a couple of days since its release, it's already generated disagreement.\nThe low pay debate is a reflection of income inequality as well. I've written before about the Second Gilded Age. In the US, economic growth hasn't translated into more income for households: median incomes have stagnated as have wages.\nWhen I asked Jason Furman, Chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, about what the administration was doing to address inequality.

        "A review - led by former NHS anti-fraud boss Jim Gee - highlighted fraud by pharmacists, dentists, GPs and patients.\nAmong the areas it found to be affected were procurement, prescriptions, registration of patients and payroll.\nThe government said the report was \"highly speculative\" and \"full of inconsistencies\".\nTo work out how much fraud is being committed, the review had to rely on estimates as well as detected fraud.\nIt said the level of fraud was likely to be between \u00a33.7bn and \u00a35.7bn a year, out of a budget of more than \u00a3110bn.\nAmong the scams highlighted were dentists claiming money for NHS care they did not carry out and GPs falsifying records for extra payments.\nTo illustrate the scale of some of these cases, it highlighted the jailing of a Birmingham dentist in 2012 after she stole \u00a31.4m from the NHS.\nPatient fraud identified included wrongful claims for free prescriptions, dental and optician care.\nBut the biggest area of fraud was estimated to be payroll, at between \u00a3555m and \u00a31.49bn - although the report said this mainly consisted of lots of small-scale cases.\nThe report warned fraud was not being given the attention it deserved and it was now one of the \"great unreduced healthcare costs\".\nMr Gee, who carried out his work for PFK Littlejohn accountants, said: \"There is a vast, honest majority who find fraud against the NHS to be completely unacceptable. However, there is also a dishonest minority who can cause significant financial damage.\n\"The best way of stopping this is not to wait for fraud to happen and then act after losses have been incurred, but to proactively deter and prevent them.

And that also gives people the opportunity to, not only play the sport, but also to come and watch and that's so important.\"\nBadminton Scotland is making a conscious effort to ensure the event grabs the attention of youngsters. Over the week while the championships are running, badminton festivals will run alongside the event. In total, 7,000 children will attend the Big Hit festivals, and each will be given a free badminton racket.\nSmillie reflected on how former Scotland internationals Susan Egelstaff and Imogen Bankier were inspired by similar events taking place in Scotland, going from spectators to world class players, winning Commonwealth and world medals. Bankier won a silver medal at the World Championships when she reached the mixed doubles final with England's Chris Adcock in London six years ago.\nGlasgow hosted the World Championships in 1997 and World Team Championships in 2007.

A sheltered British teenager of Pakistani origin, she had never had a boyfriend before.\nShe was \"terrified\" when he threatened to send the photos to her family if she did not give him money.  She handed over \u00c2\u00a3500.\n\"Sara\" married a man in an Islamic ceremony and planned to spend the rest of her life with him. He later created a website promoting her as an escort and sent it to high profile members of her local Muslim community. Both women come from families that strictly follow codes of honour and shame.\nImages like these can be devastating, as Shereen Aziz-Williams from the honour-based violence campaign group, The Henna Foundation, explained: \"The consequences are getting disowned, ostracised, being packed off back home to be married or, in the worst case scenario, getting killed.\"\nBBC Newsnight heard testimony from another South Asian woman who said she was being blackmailed by an Indian man with whom she had a relationship.  He wants a British visa and has threatened to use intimate photos of her unless she marries him.\nSara told us she later discovered the man who exposed her has also done it to three other Bangladeshi women. Soraya heard her abuser also targeted other young women.\nWilliams explained: \"It could be a girl who usually wears a scarf, who's not wearing one; or a girl showing her arms, or posing seductively fully clothed, that's deemed inappropriate.\"\n\"Soraya\" ended up under police protection after a friend alerted them that she was at risk of forced marriage.

        "The climate change, environment and rural affairs committee set out priorities after a post-Brexit inquiry.\nIt warned of a \"lack of clarity\" about how current European Union powers would be devolved.\nCommittee chairman, UKIP AM Mark Reckless, said Wales must not lose out after the vote to leave the EU.\nThe Welsh Government said it was \"encouraged\" to see cross-party support for many of the principles it had set out in its White Paper, Securing Wales' Future, and had raised during its negotiations with the UK Government.\nFor most farmers in Wales, the direct payments they receive from EU funds make up the majority of their income, accounting for an average of 81% net Welsh farm profit in 2014-15.\nAfter the UK leaves the EU, the committee said that future agricultural funding should not be subject to Barnett formula calculations in Westminster but handed straight to the Welsh Government.\nIt in turn \"must spend this level of funding in full on agriculture\".\nWales is expected to receive a total of \u00c2\u00a31.69bn (1.95bn euros) in direct payments from the EU for 2014-2020; this equates to an average of \u00c2\u00a3242m (279m euros) per year.\nIn addition, \u00c2\u00a3567.7m (655.8m euros) is set to be handed down during the same period in funding for rural development and agri-environmental schemes.\nAny move to change from direct payments for farmers to a new system of grants after Brexit should be phased in over a period covering both the current and next cycles of EU funding up until 2027, the committee said.\nIt concluded that continued financial support for farmers would be vital.\n\"Funding for farmers results in a significant multiplier from which the rural economy benefits,\" the report says.\n\"We saw this first-hand when we visited a farm in Ceredigion during our inquiry - that farm had made payments to 123 businesses in 2015-16, 95 of which were based locally.\"\nHelping farmers manage the landscape also attracts tourists and supports the language and culture of Wales, AMs said.\nThe committee said that \"innovative, made in Wales\" farming...\n\n===\n\nGiven the above document, write one sentence to summarize:",

The pressure on a young female recruit could be intolerable, couldn't it?\"\nBrig Donnelly replied: \"Yes.

They cannot fail to have been impressed by Ding's estimated \u00c2\u00a32.25m snooker earnings to date.\nBut as well as supporting home-grown players they give Westerners like Ronnie O'Sullivan and Judd Trump the star-treatment too.\nMeanwhile, Pearce says there are an estimated 60 million regular players in China, and, while the number of snooker clubs across the country is hard to determine, in Shanghai the number has gone from 200 in 2008 to 1,500 now.\nAt grass-roots level, World Snooker has joined with the Chinese snooker association in setting up an academy in Beijing, and has introduced schools programmes and amateur leagues.\nOn the global stage, Pearce says that China is at the forefront of a wider move to open up the game internationally, including in India, Malaysia and Thailand.\n\"Snooker has been historically a very...\n\nSummary:",

        "Norway's justice ministry says that the idea behind their participation is that these independent lay people \"should use their common sense and good judgement to determine questions of guilt and innocence\".\nThey provide a counterbalance to \"official power and the establishment\".\nIn criminal cases in district courts, lay judges sit together with professional judges to rule on an equal basis on both the question of guilt and on sentencing.\nDue to the nature of the case against Anders Behring Breivik, the Oslo court is sitting as an \"extended court\", with two professional and three lay judges.\nAll cases before Norwegian courts are presided over by a professional judge, in this case Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen. Professional judges are always law graduates and are civil servants appointed by an independent body.\nLay judges are appointed by local councils for a period of four years. Lay judges are then drawn from this pool as required for trials.\nAnyone selected as a lay judge is obliged to accept the office, and can expect to serve on average twice a year.\nCertain groups can claim exemption from serving as a lay judge, including MPs, lawyers and priests, those who have recently been in prison, and people whose Norwegian is not good enough.\nLay judges can also be disqualified, for example if they are found to be too close to the case. In this situation another lay judges steps in and proceedings can continue without a break.\nFinding lay judges who were not personally affected by Breivik's 22 July 2011 attacks was reportedly difficult, as so many of Norway's small population had relatives or friends who were killed or injured.\nThomas Indreboe, one of the three lay judges serving at Anders Behring Breivik's trial, was found to have posted comments on Facebook the day after the attacks saying that the perpetrator should face the death penalty.\nAlthough this was before his appointment as a lay judge, lawyers for all sides requested that he be disqualified.

Success on the course - a rolling, open layout - is usually about patiently grinding out pars rather than scorching birdie blitzes.\nThe last time the US Open was staged there in 2007, Britain's Nick Dougherty held the first-round lead with a two-under-par 68 that depended on him taking just 11 putts on the back nine.\nAngel Cabrera was the eventual champion, finishing five over par, as he held off Tiger Woods and Jim Furyk to win the first of his two major titles.\nWoods played brilliantly in the third round, hitting 13 of 14 fairways and 17 out of 18 greens in regulation, yet was still only one under par for his round.\nThe former world number one suggested Oakmont was unique because there was no let up, no straightforward shots. \"On this golf course there are none, and no easy birdies,\" he said.\n\"Most golf courses you play, you're going to pick up a cheap birdie here and there.\"\nOakmont is steeped in history and since it was founded in 1903 has had various incarnations.\nThere was a vanity project that introduced around 15,000 trees after esteemed golf writer Herbert Warren Wind described it as \"an ugly old brute\" in 1962.\nBut they were gone by 2007, removing a parkland feel and recreating a more exposed environment....\n\nSummary:",

Having completed the Knowledge himself at the age of 23, and after spending a few months as a driver, he became more and more interested in the trade as a whole. Using his previous experience in print, he started a trade magazine, which, in times of cash-flow problems, he funded by selling Knowledge material.\n\"It's a job where you're going to be guaranteed a wage. You're your own boss and you work the hours you want to work. There's no better job that can do that.\n\"Say you've got bills to pay and they need to be paid by the end of the week, you can go out there and earn that wage to pay them bills. Maybe it'll take you 15 hours one day to go and earn that but it's out there to be earned.\"\nIn order to earn a licence as a black-cab driver, students of the Knowledge must know by heart the location of every street, theatre, pub, sport venue, embassy, hospital, tourist attraction, intersection, even traffic light, as well as a staggering 320 different routes or \"runs\" that lie within a six-mile radius of the centre of London.\nAccording to cabbie lore that is not, as many might think, at Charing Cross, but rather more specifically situated underneath the posterior of Charles I's horse just in front of Trafalgar Square.\nA true test of mental...\nHow would you rephrase that in a few words?",

At low tide, the gates open again letting the water out of the lagoon, generating more electricity.\nIt's thought the turbines would generate power in this way for an average of 14 hours each day.\nEnvironment groups say the lagoon shouldn't disturb wildlife too much and that it'll make much-needed clean energy.\nBut some people are worried that the turbines might harm fish, so they don't want the lagoons built too close to rivers.\nThe company behind the scheme say the lagoon walls would act as artificial reefs for wildlife.\n\nTL;DR:",

But it is increasingly evident that the big winner in the 2016 campaign is Vladimir Putin.\nWhether or not Mr Putin interfered in the election to favour Mr Trump - the CIA seems to think so, while the FBI is less certain - there is little doubt Russian operatives hacked both the Democratic and Republican National Committees with the intent of undermining confidence in the American electoral system.\nEmails from the DNC were released throughout the campaign by WikiLeaks, providing fodder for the media and a distraction for the Hillary Clinton camp.\nPresident Barack Obama has ordered the intelligence community to assess what happened. Mr Trump reacted sceptically to preliminary reports that Russia was behind it and, at least by inference, that it was beneficial to his election.\n\"These are the same people who said that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\" he said in a statement, increasing the prospects of an antagonistic relationship with the intelligence community.\nDuring the transition, Mr Trump has shown little interest in intelligence briefings.\nHe expressed confidence while campaigning that he could work with Mr Putin to repair the fractured US-Russian relationship.\nThat intention has been reinforced with the news that Mr Tillerson is now likely to be his choice for secretary of state.\nThe nomination of Mr Tillerson, who like Mr Trump has no prior government experience, is just the latest example of the president-elect's unorthodox and unpredictable ascendance to the White House.\nHe promised better deals, and views foreign policy as a means to achieve them.\nMr Tillerson's experience running one of the leading global multinational corporations is certainly relevant to his anticipated role as diplomat-in-chief.\nHe undoubtedly knows key players in major energy producing states across the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa.\nAnd he knows Mr Putin, who bestowed on Mr Tillerson an Order of Friendship award...\n\nNow, can you write me an extremely short abstract for it?",

The reason is simple: there is no watershed on the internet and you cannot put out these kind of images without causing people, especially children, real upset.\nI understand this completely.\nI returned from Rwanda and Burundi in 1988 from reporting a massacre for the Observer, and back in London described a machete wound to a friend, who wrote TV comedies.

Native to the region, it thrives on disturbed soil - such as roadsides and felled forests. Once established, it quickly forms a monoculture and suppresses other species from becoming established.\nAs opposed to more resource-intensive programmes, such as agro-forestry schemes or large-scale plantation projects, the authors highlighted how ANR schemes were relatively passive and cheap, allowing local communities to become actively involved.\nThey added that while the vast grasslands provided grazing sites for cattle and roofing material, there were relatively few other benefits when the potential productivity of the area was taken into account.\nThe scheme follows a...\n\n===\n\nWrite a summary of the text above :",

Referee Moss said no penalty, and showed Vardy a second yellow card for diving.\nShearer: \"This was the decision that changed the whole dynamic of the game. It had looked like we were heading for another 1-0 Leicester win - suddenly they were down to 10 men and there was a very different atmosphere.\n\"I did not think the tackle that got Vardy his first booking was worthy of a yellow card at all, but this one was definitely a dive.\n\"As much as you can criticise the referee for what happens later, Vardy has to take some criticism because it is blatant.\n\"There was no need for him to dive, because he has got the wrong side of the defender anyway. He was expecting contact, contact didn't come and there was even a little pirouette in there just as he was going over.\"\nWright: \"Vardy hardly touched Kouyate - that one was a very, very harsh booking.

        "My college roommate asked me what this article means:\n\nBusiness for Britain, which wants the UK to leave the EU, says more than 60% of UK law is influenced by EU law.\nRobert Oxley from Vote Leave says, \"If you stacked the entire EU rule book it would be higher than Nelson's column. That's an incredible amount of paperwork which British businesses, British employers, all the people who have to comply with this legislation have to deal with.  It is cost and time added on to their businesses.\"\nBut some put the figure far lower, at around 13%. So who is right?\nIn a nutshell it's somewhere in-between the two - let's look at why.\nTo try to work out the proportion of UK law derived from EU law, you need to define what you mean by UK law and EU law, understand how they relate to one another, and only then \"do the math\".\nSo, what is meant by UK law? That's tricky because the devolved legislatures in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales all pass laws that apply only in their nations, and not all laws passed at Westminster apply to the entire UK.\nEssentially, there are two main kinds of UK law. Acts of Parliament, also known as statutes, and statutory instruments, which flesh out how a statute will work.\nThere are also two main types of EU law. There are EU regulations, most of which apply automatically in all 28 EU member states - so most EU regulations are part of UK law.\nThen there are EU directives, which set out an aim for member states to achieve. They don't specify how to achieve it, but directives have to be implemented by a national law. The UK normally does this through a statutory instrument.\nOkay, got the terms straight?  Let's start the number crunching.\nAccording to the House of Commons Library, which itself concedes that there is no completely accurate way to make the calculation, between 1993 and 2014 Parliament passed 945 Acts of which 231 implemented EU obligations of some sort.\nIt also passed 33,160 Statutory Instruments, 4,283 of which implemented EU obligations.

Called \"passive driftwood collectors\", these devices are increasingly catching plastic, not fallen tree branches.\nSome 400 tonnes of rubbish are being caught annually, and while that mass has stayed fairly stable over time, its volume has shot up, indicating that discarded plastic is on the rise.\nThames21's army of volunteers have been clearing the foreshores regularly for 10 years.  They have noticed the change that is occurring.\n\"In the early days, it was a huge mixture of stuff - metalwork, old fridges and supermarket trolleys,\" said the charity's CEO Debbie Leach.\n\"We've dealt largely with these bigger items, and now what we find is that it is the plastic that keeps coming back - water bottles, carrier bags and, amazingly, cotton wool buds. We find millions of the plastic sticks all over the foreshore.\"\nOn the day of the launch of the campaign, Bank of America employees had volunteered to clean up exposed muds at Greenwich.\nThey were having to dig deep to get to the shopping bags, which had been buried in many centimetres of sediment.\nOf course, much of the plastic debris is not being caught...\nSummary:",

People are eating a lot of junk food and rejecting traditional food,\" says Finance Minister Thomas Isaac.\nKerala has the most number of people suffering from obesity after the northern state of Punjab in India, according to a national family health survey. With increasing affluence, lifestyle diseases are on the rise and the government aims to check this with the fat tax.\nBut the southern state is a relatively new stop for global fast food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Domino's and KFC.\nMcDonald's, the world's biggest fast food chain, has only seven restaurants in Kerala and Burger King just launched its first outlet in Kochi a few weeks ago.\nWhile Burger King didn't want to comment on how this newly imposed tax will affect it, an official statement from McDonald's said the company would be studying the details of the proposal.\nLocal cafe owners though are more vocal about the proposed tax.\nIsaac Alexander, owner of a popular cafe in Kochi, says the \"ambit of taxation is very narrow\".\n\"A lot of local food is more fatty and unhealthy.

It went into dry dock for more than a week for repairs.\nBBC Scotland understands that, because of the age of the vessel, sourcing some replacement parts has proved very difficult.\nRather than take the vessel out of service and cause months of disruption to Arran - and potentially abandon the Campbeltown service completely for the moment - a decision was made to make temporary repairs to ensure the vessel was safe and seaworthy and able to resume service.\nHowever, because full, permanent repairs could not be made, the threshold for cancellations because of the wind is now significantly lower than normal for legal and licensing reasons.\nThis has led to a number of cancellations on the lifeline Ardrossan to Brodick route in what may appear to be relatively good weather.\nInstead passengers have had to wait an hour or so for the next sailing on the other vessel which covers the route.\nIt also means that the Campbeltown service has been cancelled on several occasions - sometimes at short notice and risking significant problems for foot passengers.\nIf the ferry is cancelled at short notice, foot passengers in Ardrossan have no other way of reaching Campbeltown easily.\nThis is because the last scheduled bus of the day from Glasgow will already have left, although CalMac has run replacement bus services from Ardrossan.\nJohn Armour, the SNP member for South Kintyre in...",

One country is Persian, the other Arab.\nBut after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, the two countries found that they had considerable mutual interests.\nThey needed to come together to fight their common rival, Saddam Hussein of Iraq. They also allied in order to check Israeli advances into Lebanon and to prevent any American attempts to enter the Middle East.\nEach provided support to the Lebanese armed movement Hezbollah and to the Palestinian armed groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad.\nSyria has consistently provided Iran with an element of strategic depth. It gives Iran access to the Mediterranean and a supply line to Iran's Shia Muslim supporters in southern Lebanon next to the border with Israel.\nIn other words, Iran's alliance with Syria gives Tehran the ability to project its power right up to the Israeli border.\nLosing this ability to project its power via Syria would represent a strong blow to Iran. This helps to explain why Iran's government has supported President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's conflict with rebel forces.\nIn addition, the two governments share a common view of the world. In particular, they appear to view any opposition to their respective administrations as a Western-inspired plot.\n\"The essence of the Islamic Awakening in the region is anti-Zionist and anti-US,\" said Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in June 2011. \"But in the case of Syria, US and Israeli hands are evidently at work.\"\nThe United States accuses Iran of providing direct assistance to President Assad's government.\nOfficials say that Iran has sent advisers to Syria and has provided riot gear and surveillance equipment to Syrian security forces.

        "Summarize this document: Economists were forecasting that borrowing would hold steady.\nThe latest figures are a set back for Chancellor George Osborne, who in March pledged to cut the budget deficit by more than 10% over the next 12 months.\nBetween April and September borrowing was \u00a358bn, a rise of \u00a35.4bn compared with the same period last year.\nThat is an increase of 10.3%. Last month's figures showed borrowing between April and August was 6% higher than a year earlier.\nAnalysis: Simon Jack, Business correspondent, BBC News\nPlans to reduce the deficit are getting further off track. The government has so far borrowed 10% more this year than it did at the same time last year. It means the chancellor has no room for manoeuvre as he prepares his pre-election tax and spending plans, due to be announced in early December.\nThere were some bright spots for him - stamp duty is 25% up on the year - but income tax was flat, despite a record breaking fall in unemployment since last year, suggesting job growth has been in low-paid work. The deficit has come down a third since 2010, but the progress has stalled and this year is heading in the wrong direction.\n\"We have seen stronger growth in receipts this month, but as today's figures show, the impact of the great recession is still being felt in our economy and the public finances,\" a Treasury spokesman said.\n\"At the same time, we have to recognise that the UK is not immune to the problems being experienced in Europe and other parts of the world economy.\"\nEconomists say the borrowing situation will limit the government's options in the run-up to next year's election.\n\"The continued run of poor UK public borrowing figures looks set to severely hamper the chancellor's ability to announce giveaways to address his party's deficit in the national opinion polls before next year's general election,\" said Samuel Tombs, senior economist at Capital Economics.\n\"The chancellor will be forced to acknowledge in December's Autumn Statement that the fiscal consolidation is not going to plan, limiting his scope...\nSummary:",

The board is confident that all has been done to reach the mission objectives in the 'costs at completion' which are at the moment foreseen,\" he told BBC News.\nEarthcare is one of Esa's proposed Earth Explorers - a series of spacecraft that will do innovative science in obtaining data on issues of pressing environmental concern.\nThree missions have so far gone into orbit, returning remarkable new information on gravity, polar ice cover, soil moisture and ocean salinity.\nEarthcare will study how clouds and aerosols (fine particles) form, evolve and affect our climate, the weather and air quality.\nScientists say knowledge gaps in such areas severely hamper their ability to forecast future change.\nDifferent sorts of cloud have different effects. For example, low cloud can help cool the planet while high cloud can act as a blanket.\nDeveloping the primary instrument on Earthcare to get at this information has proved extremely problematic, however.\nPrime contractor, Astrium-France, has had a torrid time arriving at a design that will reliably work in the vacuum of space.\nA fundamental re-configuration of the lidar has added...",

        "Article: Data from the genomes of 69 ancient individuals suggest that herders moved en masse from the continent's eastern periphery into Central Europe.\nThese migrants may be responsible for the expansion of Indo-European languages, which make up the majority of spoken tongues in Europe today.\nAn international team has published the research in the journal Nature.\nProf David Reich and colleagues extracted DNA from remains found at archaeological sites around the continent. They used a new DNA-enrichment technique that greatly reduces the amount of sequencing needed to obtain genome-wide data.\nTheir analyses show that 7,000-8,000 years ago, a closely related group of early farmers moved into Europe from the Near East, confirming the findings of previous studies.\nThe farmers were distinct from the indigenous hunter-gatherers they encountered as they spread around the continent. Eventually, the two groups mixed, so that by 5,000-6,000 years ago, the farmers' genetic signature had become melded with that of the indigenous Europeans.\nBut previous studies show that a two-way amalgam of farmers and hunters is not sufficient to capture the genetic complexity of modern Europeans. A third ancestral group must have been added to the melting pot more recently.\nProf Reich and colleagues have now identified a likely source area for this later diaspora. The Bronze Age Yamnaya pastoralists of southern Russia are a good fit for the missing third genetic component in Europeans.\nThe team analysed nine genomes from individuals belonging to this nomadic group, which buried their dead in mounds known as kurgans.\nThe scientists contend that a group similar to the Yamnaya moved into the European heartland after the invention of wheeled vehicles, contributing up to 50% of ancestry in some modern north Europeans. Southern Europeans on the whole appear to have been less affected by the expansion.\nEven more intriguing is the possible link between this steppe expansion and the origins of Indo-European languages.\nMost indigenous European tongues,...\n\nSummary:",

It is really about the availability [of the cleaners and handymen],\" says Mr Hanrahan.\n\"You have to become the biggest, as this gives you the most service professionals.\"\nBorn and bred in Dublin, Mr Hanrahan opened his first business while studying economics at the city's prestigious Trinity University.\nUsing money he had saved by working for a year between school and university, he decided to launch his own property development...\n\nTL;DR:",

His driver and a bodyguard also died in the ambush.\nBecker, 59, denied any involvement. Two-and-a-half years already served in jail will be cut from her sentence.\nThe killer has not yet been uncovered.\nThe ambush happened in the south-western city of Karlsruhe.
