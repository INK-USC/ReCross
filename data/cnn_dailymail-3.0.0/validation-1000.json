        "Summarise the article:\n\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Sunday he supports the Obama administration's decision to repeal the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy banning gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military -- a move that was staunchly opposed by most top Republicans. \"I think the decision that's been made with respect to allowing gays to serve openly in the military is a good one\" Cheney told CNN's Candy Crowley on \"State of the Union.\" \"It's the right thing to do.\" The policy, first enacted during the Clinton administration, was officially repealed on September 20. Over 14,000 people were kicked out of the military due to \"don't ask, don't tell.\" The controversial repeal of the policy became a focal point of a GOP presidential debate last month when members of the audience booed a gay soldier who asked about the decision. President Barack Obama criticized the Republican presidential contenders on Saturday night for failing to rebuke the audience. \"We don't believe in standing silent when that happens,\" Obama told attendees at the annual National Dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, an organization that promotes equality for gays and lesbians. If \"you want to be commander-in-chief, you can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States even when it is not politically convenient,\" Obama said. Cheney responded to Obama by noting that he's \"a little bit leery of the notion that somehow we ought to go hammer the Republican candidates because they didn't respond to booing in the audience.\" \"When you're in a political campaign and debates, people boo a lot of things,\" Cheney told CNN. \"I'm not sure that it was all focused specifically on that particular issue.\" After the debate, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said he hadn't heard the booing when the question was asked. Santorum was being asked the question when the incident occurred.",

        "In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?\n\nArticle: (CNN) -- Fighting in the volatile Sudanese region of Darfur has sparked another wave of refugees into Chad and left a Red Cross employee dead, according to international agencies. Refugee camps in eastern Chad house about 300,000 people who fled violence in the Darfur region of Sudan. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said on Monday that more than 12,000 people have fled militia attacks over the last few days from Sudan's Darfur region to neighboring Chad, still recovering from a recent attempt by rebels there to topple the government. \"Most of the new arrivals in Chad had already been displaced in Darfur in recent years. They are really tired of being attacked and having to move,\" said UNHCR's Jorge Holly. \"All the new refugees we talked to said they did not want to go back to Darfur at this point, they wanted to be transferred to a refugee camp in eastern Chad.\" This latest influx of refugees in Chad aggravates an already deteriorating security situation across this politically unstable region of Africa. Before the latest flight into Chad, the UNHCR and its partner groups \"were taking care of 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 camps in eastern Chad and some 50,000 from Central African Republic in the south of the country.\" Up to 30,000 people in Chad fled the country for Cameroon during the rebel-government fighting. The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Monday that one of its employees was killed in western Darfur last week during fighting. The victim is a 45-year-old Sudanese national and father of six children. He was killed in the area of Seleia, one of the three towns where reported government-backed Janjaweed militia attacks on Friday left around 200 people dead. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week deplored the acts, urged all parties to stop hostilities, and said \"all parties must adhere to international humanitarian law, which prohibits military attacks against civilians.\" The United Nations says \"more than 200,000 people have been killed and 2.2 million others forced to...",

A lot has been said about the fact that just a handful of them were actually from Ferguson. But there's more to the story. A close look at the official arrest logs of the St. Louis County police, which CNN obtained Friday, shows that while some people did travel to Ferguson to protest the shooting of a black teen by a white police officer, a majority of the people arrested live in the St. Louis area. More than half of them were charged with a relatively minor offense: refusing to disperse when asked by police. Read the arrest log (PDF) Ferguson is a small suburban town, just 21,000 people packed into six square miles flush against St. Louis International Airport. The unrest started when unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot to death August 9 by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. Anger over the shooting, and the Ferguson police department's initial refusal to identify the officer who shot Brown, set off nightly confrontations between police and protesters. The worst violence came nine days after the shooting: on Monday into the wee hours of Tuesday. Police responded in militarized fashion, firing tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd and confiscating firearms, Molotov cocktails and, reportedly, water bottles filled with urine. There was sporadic looting. Where is Officer Darren Wilson? The force of the police response has been sharply criticized. But the finger-pointing went both ways. Some officials in Ferguson blamed outsiders for stirring up trouble. A deeper dive into the arrest logs and a search of social media and online news accounts show some self-avowed \"communists\" and others who could be considered \"agitators.\"  But the vast majority of arrestees who gave out-of-town addresses were college students, peaceniks, legal advisers and journalists. The logs compiled by the St. Louis County police cover August 10 through 22 and list 212 arrests...",

            "By . Bianca London . We can all recall that scene in 1990 rom-com Pretty Woman where Julia Roberts walks into a luxury boutique dressed in her scruffy clothes and the saleswoman says: 'I don\u2019t think we have anything for you here. You\u2019re obviously in the wrong place.' It now appears the snooty woman behind the till might have hit upon a genius sales tactic - because, according to new research, rude sales assistants can actually make us want to buy more. According to the study, called 'Should the Devil Sell Prada? Retail Rejection Increases Aspiring Consumers' Desire for the Brand', which will be published in the October issue of the Journal of Consumer Research, staff with an obnoxious attitude makes shoppers want to spend more - as long as it's luxury goods on offer. Remember that? Just like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, who returns to the store who snubbed her carrying high-end bags after a shopping spree, rude staff can actually make us want to buy more, reveals a new study . The University of British Columbia sought to understand the relationship between rude treatment and desire to purchase something . Professor Darren Dahl, a marketing expert leading the research, carried out a study whereby volunteers were given a scenario. The participants were told to imagine that they were shopping at either a designer or high street clothes shop. Actors playing sales assistants were told to treat the participants with a welcoming or snooty attitude. Could it work? A professor behind the study said that snobbiness might actually be a qualification worth considering for luxury brands like Louis Vuitton or Gucci . The results revealed that those participants treated with attitude said it made them want to purchase the designer goods more. 'This only worked for brands and stores that customers would aspire to, truly luxury brands like Burberry or Gucci,' said Professor Darren Dahl. He added: 'It appears that snobbiness might actually be a qualification worth considering for luxury brands like Louis Vuitton or Gucci...."

President Jakaya Kikwete, next to President Bush, looks on as Bush greets a boy at a Tanzanian hospital Sunday. The gift of the American basketball icon's size-23 hightops spoke to the lighter side of Bush's visit. President Jakaya Kikwete presented gifts, too -- a stuffed leopard and lion, a Zebra skin and a wood carving for the American president who was enthusiastically welcomed on the second stop of his five-nation African tour. The Tanzanian president later artfully dodged a reporter's question on the potential that the U.S. might elect a black president, Sen. Barack Obama, whose father is Kenyan. Kikwete looked at Bush before demonstrating his political deftness, saying, \"Let him be as good a friend of Africa as President Bush has been.\" But there was plenty of serious business to tend to as well, namely the signing of a compact under which the U.S. is to provide a $698 million grant to Tanzania.

U.S. funding is intended to help African governments buy mosquito netting and insecticide to prevent the spread of malaria. \"It breaks my heart to know that little children are dying needlessly because of a mosquito bite,\" Bush said. Bush also attended a roundtable on the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, program, which Kikwete said is saving lives and helping the African continent avert a health disaster. Bush said he has requested $30 billion over the next five years for the program.

But it was Danny Green and Gary Neal of the Spurs who took the contest away from the defending champion at San Antonio's AT & Center on Tuesday as the home side took a 2-1 series lead.

Game Five, to be played on Sunday, will take place in San Antonio before the series return to Miami's American Airlines Arena. \"We didn't do anything right,\" said James, whose team lost in the 2011 finals. \"We can't play like that on either side of the floor if we want to win. \"At the end of the day it is just one win for them.

During the show, the pop star's manager Scooter Braun told the crowd that Bieber was \"backstage with the EMTs and the doctor\" after getting \"very light of breath,\" in a statement posted on YouTube. To the cheers of fans, Braun went on to say, \"He has just told me ... he's going to come out and finish the show.\" After the concert, he was taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure and was released early Friday. \"He's been released from the hospital early this a.m. after a check-up and while he's feeling a little under the weather, he's planning on going ahead with tonight's show,\" the representative said later in the day. Bieber took to his official Twitter account after the incident, thanking fans for sticking with him: \"getting better. thanks for everyone pulling me thru tonight. best fans in the world. figuring out what happened. thanks for the love.\" On Instagram, Bieber said he was \"Gettin better listening to Janice Joplin\" in a picture that showed the shirtless singer apparently lounging in a hospital room with a pair of headphones on.

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- If you doubt there's a dental health crisis in America, walk into any emergency room. Every day, thousands of people without access to a dentist are looking for dental care in our ERs, most of which cannot provide the care these patients need. We're experiencing this alarming trend right here in Greensboro, North Carolina. For example, one of our local hospitals, the Moses Cone Health Center, finds that about 10% of ER cases are related to dental issues. Nationally, more than 2.1 million people, the vast majority of them adults, showed up in ERs with dental pain in 2010, double the number just a decade prior, according to the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Those ER visits for largely preventable issues cost the health system more than $2 billion that year. And the majority of dental ER visits, nearly 80%, were for common and preventable conditions like abscesses and cavities. The reason for this? The percentage of working-age adults -- particularly young adults -- with private dental benefits continues to decline. And more than half of lower-income adults say they haven't seen a dentist in a year or longer. So patients go without proper cleaning and examinations and end up at the ER when a problem strikes. But most ERs are not staffed or equipped to diagnose and treat dental problems. Typically, they provide antibiotics and pain medication only. This results in patients returning to the ER to treat the same dental issues as soon as the pain returns. Unfortunately, the Affordable Care Act will provide little relief. The new law has no substantive dental provisions for low-income adults, despite the fact that dental health is critical to overall health. Dental crisis could create 'State of Decay' What's the solution? Foremost, it's prevention. We need programs to get patients proper preventive care. And when patients have dental issues that need immediate attention, they need access to a dentist to treat the underlying problem. The good news is that we are beginning to tackle this...",

            "Moscow (CNN) -- Russian investigators said Wednesday they had found narcotics on a Greenpeace ship whose crew was detained in the Arctic last month -- an allegation quickly disputed by Greenpeace as a smear. Some of the 30 people who were aboard the icebreaker Arctic Sunrise are likely to face additional charges, the Russian Investigative Committee said. Authorities say they think the narcotics include opium. The 28 Greenpeace activists and two journalists who were arrested on the ship as they protested Arctic drilling already face piracy charges. All 30 pleaded not guilty in court last week. The Investigative Committee said Russian experts were looking into the \"origin and purpose\" of the drugs seized, which it described as \"presumably opium straw and morphine.\" Greenpeace said the claim that Russian authorities had found drugs on the vessel \"is a smear, it's a fabrication, pure and simple.\" \"We assume this announcement is designed to deflect attention from the growing global outrage over the continued imprisonment of the detainees,\" it said in a written statement. The environmental campaign group has repeatedly condemned the detention of its activists, saying they were taking part in a peaceful protest against the \"slow but unrelenting destruction of the Arctic.\" Russian authorities made the arrests after two of the activists left the Arctic Sunrise and tried to climb the side of an oil platform owned by the Russian energy giant Gazprom in the Barents Sea. The government in the Netherlands -- where the Arctic Sunrise is registered -- wrote to the Dutch parliament Friday to say it has launched legal action aimed at freeing the 30 under the U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea. Two of those detained are Dutch citizens. Greenpeace holds vigil, Dutch launch legal action .

Ruhal Ahmed, left, shown at a 2007 news conference, says he had to listen to hours of music at Guantanamo. The artists have endorsed a series of Freedom of Information Act requests, which were filed Thursday morning, asking the U.S. government to declassify documents that would reveal which artists' work was used on detainees at U.S. prison facilities and military detention centers, including the one at Guantanamo Bay. The National Security Archive, a Washington-based independent research institute that advocates \"for the right to know,\" filed the requests on behalf of the Close Gitmo Now campaign, which launched this week, the archive's senior analyst Kate Doyle said. The multimillion-dollar national grassroots Close Gitmo Now campaign is aimed at pressuring members of Congress to support President Obama's endeavor to close the Guantanamo Bay prison. It is supported by a coalition of retired generals and liberal activists. The requests are based on the testimony of former Guantanamo prisoners and guards, as well as declassified documents, that identified music from 35 artists -- ranging from AC/DC tunes to the theme from Sesame Street -- used in the interrogations of detainees, Doyle said.

Esha Momeni, 28, had been working on a project on the women's movement in Iran when she was arrested October 15 for an alleged traffic violation, according to California State University-Northridge and Change For Equality, an Iranian women's movement. She had been held in solitary confinement in Tehran's notorious Evin Prison, Change For Equality said. \"We're really happy she's been released on bail,\" Elise Auerbach of Amnesty International said Tuesday. She said she learned of Momeni's release Monday through Amnesty's researchers in London, England, and from Momeni's family and friends. Melissa Wall, a journalism professor at the university and an academic adviser to Momeni, confirmed the young woman's release in an e-mail. Wall said they were waiting to see what will \"happen next in terms of charges or conditions or sentencing.\" The university will hold a rally and vigil Wednesday calling for Momeni's return to California, she said. The event had been planned before Momeni's release. Auerbach, the Iran specialist for Amnesty International USA, said she did not know the exact bail amount, only that Momeni's parents had handed over the deed to their home in Iran in return for their daughter's release. \"This is a real problem for her family because the state of their home is in doubt,\" Auerbach said, adding that if the Iranian government determines Momeni has violated the bail conditions, it can take her family's home.

The missing whales were among 51 stranded on the edge of Everglades National Park last week, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Twenty-two of those whales are confirmed dead, and scientists are performing necropsies to figure out why. The only commonality so far is that all the dead adult whales are female, scientists said. Eleven dead whales were spotted Sunday in the lower Florida Keys, and 11 others were found dead last week. Some whales were spotted alive on Friday, when a pod of 20 was seen five nautical miles offshore, moving inshore and in a southward direction. They were reportedly swimming slowly and in a disorganized fashion, which might suggest exhaustion, dehydration or malnutrition, according to NOAA. Pilot whales are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, but they are not endangered. Mass strandings by pilot whales are not uncommon in Florida. In 2012, nearly two dozen pilot whales stranded and beached themselves. In 2011, 23 pilot whales stranded and beached themselves. Anyone who spots the whales in the waters off southern Florida are asked to call 877-WHALE-HELP."

The Madrid train bombings -- coordinated attacks on four morning-rush commuter trains -- killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800. Spanish courts have convicted 14 Islamic militants for their roles in the Madrid bombings, along with four Spaniards, the latter for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks. Seven other prime Islamic suspects killed themselves in an explosion as police closed in on their hideout in a Madrid suburb three weeks after the bombings. The Casablanca bombings in May 2003 killed 33 bystanders and 12 suicide bombers. Rehou is wanted in Spain for belonging to a terrorist group, and is thought to have formed part of a cell created in Spain in 2002, with the aim of recruiting fighters to carry out attacks in Morocco, Spain and other countries, the police statement said. The meetings at his home lasted six to eight hours, with the screening of videos that included sermons and scenes promoting holy war, the statement said.",

Right Wing Extreme, which describes itself as a Christian conservative group, also said in the posting it is asking the Dove World Outreach Center, based in Gainesville, Florida, not to hold the event \"for the reason that it may diminish the work of the Holy Spirit to witness to Muslims.\" The event is planned for the ninth anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks. While the group agrees with the Dove Center's stance on Islam, press coverage of recent events, such as \"Burn a Quran Day,\" a recent \"Everybody Draw Mohammed Day\" group on Facebook and the controversy surrounding a proposed mosque and Islam community center near ground zero in New York is \"really inciting a lot of hatred and a lot of violence that's going on,\" Right Wing Extreme founder Shannon Carson told CNN. \"We don't want to be a part of inciting violence and racism anymore.\" The group's website posting said it believes the \"liberal media\" is intentionally using such stories \"to distract, divide and enrage the public.\" Carson said he had not yet spoken to Dove World Outreach Center Pastor Terry Jones, but plans to sometime Wednesday.

In a televised announcement Tuesday, Netanyahu said the election was necessary to ensure \"a responsible security and economic policy\" in the face of the economic downturn and threats to Israel's security from Iran and elsewhere. The election will ideally happen in three months' time, he said, rather than in October 2013, as originally scheduled. \"It is my obligation as the prime minister to put the national interest above everything else,\" Netanyahu said.

The two men, both age 39, are accused of trying to force Ikea to pay a ransom of 6 million euros (U.S. $8 million).

If you've been to the movies lately, you may have seen a trailer for a Martin Scorsese film with that name. It's the title of the first book in a two-volume memoir by former stock swindler Jordan Belfort, upon whom the film is based. The trailer appears to portray Belfort as a player in a small part of lower Manhattan that's become the world-famous icon of capitalism. It opens with dizzying shots of famous symbols such as the Wall Street sign and the bronze Charging Bull statue, a favorite photo backdrop for tourists. There's a hilarious scene with Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, hamming it up with one of his early mentors, played by Matthew McConaughey, at a window table in a restaurant with fabulous city views. You think Wall Street big shots might go there. And if you haven't caught on yet, the camera moves to Belfort on his yacht, which happens to be bobbing in a harbor with the World Financial Center in the background. \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" might turn out to be great entertainment, which is what Hollywood is for. And maybe Belfort really did dock his 167-foot yacht near the Financial Center at least once before it sank in a Mediterranean storm. But don't fall for the scenery.

Michael Massaro says he has a few aches and pains, but a good night's sleep has done him some good as he recovers from being attacked Saturday with a knife in a confessional at his church. The Rev. Michael Massaro is recovering from two stab wounds that required 14 staples to close. It was one of the most harrowing weekends in the 28 years he's been a Roman Catholic priest, Massaro said. But it won't stop him from hearing confessions. \"We're at the mercy of the people we serve,\" Massaro told CNN. \"We can't live in fear. God has asked us to live in trust. If it's going to happen again, it's going to happen again, but that's not going to prevent me from doing God's work.\" Massaro had just finished hearing confessions in his Florida church when he was stabbed twice in the back by a woman who later told police Massaro is the Antichrist. \"It was paralyzing, like a nightmare, and I just feel like I woke up from it. It was so quick and sudden,\" Massaro said in a telephone interview. Vero Beach police arrested Josephine Gatchell in connection with the attack. The 57-year-old suspect is being held in the Indian River County Jail. She is being held without bail. Gatchell is scheduled to be arraigned on June 12. She has not yet been appointed a lawyer, prosecutors and the public defender said. \"She believed [Massaro] was the Antichrist and it was her duty to go there and injure him,\" police spokesman John Morrison said. Massaro said he thought he had one last confession to hear at about 12:15 p.m. on Saturday. A woman was waiting for him, apparently wanting to be be the last one in. \"I was in the confessional, putting my coat on, and felt a piercing sensation in my back left side,\" the priest recalled. \"I looked up and she was standing there, and I felt it again in my back. Then I realized I was stabbed and my hand was covered with blood.\" Massaro said his alleged attacker stared at him but never said a word. \"I ran and got to the car and hoped I could make it to the hospital before...",

            "(CNN) -- France's Pierrick Fedrigo won stage 15 of the Tour de France on Monday, as Britain's Bradley Wiggins consolidated his hold on the leader's yellow jersey. The 158.5-kilometer ride between Samatan and Pau saw a further six riders withdraw from the race as cycling's premier event entered its third and final week. Fedrigo became the fourth Frenchman to win a stage at this year's race when he beat Christian Vande Velde in a sprint to the line in Pau. The two racers had surged ahead of the leading pack with 6.5 km to go. \"I don't know why I attacked, it was just instinct. But when Vande Velde stopped giving me relays in the last kilometer I knew that I would soon have to sprint,\" Fedrigo said. \"Thankfully, I've got a little more punch than him.\" Wiggins edged nearer to a place in the record books with a solid, if uninspiring, ride. No Englishman has won the Tour de France before, and Wiggins' Team Sky have made it clear they value the yellow jersey above the other titles on offer. Last year's green jersey winner Mark Cavendish would have expected to be part of the pack sprinting for a stage win, but he stuck to team orders and helped protect Wiggins as he rode to maintain his overall lead. The 32-year-old, who was born in Belgium where his Australian father was based, finished in the peloton 11 minutes and 50 seconds behind Fedrigo. Wiggins remained two minutes and five seconds ahead of teammate Chris Froome, with Italy's Vincenzo Nibali third at 2:23 behind and Australia's defending champion Cadel Evans fourth (3:19).

While I do not know, and no one knows, if Robin Williams is \"free,\" he is dead, and his loss has devastated us all. Suicide needs to be talked about as a fatal outcome that is, in the majority of cases, preventable and caused by severe illness and/or extreme psychological anguish. When I learned about Williams' suicide on Monday, it knocked the wind out of me. Sure, I am the president of the American Association of Suicidology, so I am alert to media coverage of suicide.

Robin Williams' portrayal of a wacky alien just trying to make it in this world provided comfort, laughter, and wonderful memories. His death, by any means, is a deeply sad event. That he died from suicide (a cause of death I try to prevent nearly every day) just makes his death that much more painful to me. Opinion: Why Robin Williams lost to depression . One of the questions I am usually asked after such a high-profile public suicide is: How does the news of a suicide affect others who are at risk? When it comes to high profile suicides, the research about contagion (or \"copycat effect\") is not clear. We can't say for sure if media coverage increases the risk of more people attempting suicide. However, our best research suggests that \"how\" we discuss suicide in the media is more important than \"if\" it is discussed. People tend to be afraid to talk about suicide, which is disheartening considering that suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. It kills more people than motor vehicle accidents and more than twice as many as homicide. Opinion:...",

They won't allow devices without power on board planes. The traveler may then undergo additional screening. It's part of an update to security measures aimed at combating potential new threats from terrorists in the Middle East and Europe. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson directed the TSA last week to enhance security at overseas airports that have direct flights to the United States. The specifics of the enhanced measures weren't originally released, and it isn't known what other measures the TSA may employ. The TSA also would have to coordinate with the foreign governments which provide security at airports in their countries, along with the airlines and private security companies. \"Our job is to ... try to anticipate the next attack, not simply react to the last one. And so we continually evaluate the world situation, and we know that there remains a terrorist threat to the United States, and aviation security is a large part of that,\" Johnson told NBC's \"Meet The Press.\" \"This is not something to overreact to or over-speculate about,\" he said. A homeland security official said last week that the changes would primarily focus on airports in Europe and the Middle East. The effort does not involve changes to what travelers can take aboard flights. But passengers may see additional inspections of shoes and electronics, additional use of scanners designed to detect trace amounts of explosives, and another stage of screening at boarding gates, in some cases, the official said. The changes came about based on new intelligence on terror groups trying to build new types of improvised explosives that are harder to detect, the official told CNN.

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- The Galaxy S4 mini, a slimmed-down version of Samsung's flagship smartphone, is on its way, the company announced Thursday. Widely rumored after an accidental leak, the company confirmed that the mini will be one of the products rolled out at a Samsung event in London on June 20. On the heels of a hot start for the Galaxy S4, which the company says sold 10 million units in less than a month, the Korean gadget-maker seems to be homing in on the rival iPhone with a handset that promises to be easier to grip than its bulkier cousins in the Galaxy line. The mini will have a 4.3-inch display screen, comparable to the iPhone 5's 4-inch screen, and weigh 3.77 ounces -- a pip lighter than the iPhone's 3.95. The Galaxy S4 has a 5-inch screen, while Samsung's Galaxy Note II \"phablet\" has a whopping 5.5-inch display. \"We want to give people more choices with Galaxy S4 mini, similar look and feel of Galaxy S4 for more compact and practical uses,\" J.K. Shin, CEO and president of Samsung's mobile division, said in a blog post. The new phone will feature an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera (down from the S4's 13 megapixels) and 2-megapixel front-facing camera. It also will come with 8GB of internal memory, running up to 64GB if, as with the S4, the user adds an available memory microchip. It will be a sleek 9mm wide (.35 inches), a hair wider than the iPhone 5's 7.6mm (.3 inches), and run the latest version of Google's Android operating system, Jelly Bean, with a 1.7 Ghz dual-core processor. The device will come in either white or black. No price or release date was announced. The announcement further illustrates the divergent mobile strategies of Samsung and Apple. While the Cupertino tech giant fine-tunes a single phone, Samsung floods the zone with a variety of models, ranging from low-end handsets to its more upscale Galaxy line. \"Samsung's overall smartphone strategy is about producing scores of iterations at various price points and screen sizes in order to saturate the market with as much of its hardware as...",

        "Sum the following article in brief: Los Angeles (CNN) -- A lawyer for Michael Jackson's estate gave an entertainment industry consultant permission to help AEG Live in its defense of the wrongful death lawsuit filed by the pop singer's mother, the expert testified. The revelation was a surprise to Katherine Jackson, who was sitting in court Tuesday listening to the expert testify that he believed her son would not have earned any money even if he had not died of a propofol overdose. If jurors decide AEG Live is liable in Jackson's death, testimony by Eric Briggs -- whose company billed the concert promoter $700,000 to prepare his opinion -- could be used to determine how much in damages the company would have to pay to Michael Jackson's mother and three children. Briggs, however, previously consulted for the Jackson estate in determining a value of it's biggest asset -- the Sony-ATV music catalog that includes the Beatles songs. He testified that before he signed a contract to serve as an expert in AEG Live's defense he sought and gained permission from the Jackson estate lawyer Jeryll Cohen to waive any potential conflict of interest. \"She (Cohen) was well aware of everything that was going on,\" Briggs testified. A spokesman for the Michael Jackson estate was unaware of the circumstances or reasons why the estate would approve the waiver that could be counter to the interests of its beneficiaries -- Jackson's mother and three children. Bad news hurt Jackson's earning potential, witness says . An entertainment industry analyst hired by Jackson lawyers testified he was \"reasonably certain\" Jackson would have earned $1.5 billion from touring before retiring if he had not died while preparing for his comeback concerts in 2009. Briggs testified that it was \"speculative\" that Jackson would have even completed the 50 \"This Is It\" concerts that AEG Live had already sold out in London. Briggs said that based on what he'd learned from testimony in the case, he believed that Jackson would have died before the first show -- even if he had not suffered the...",

A boy was left almost completely blind for the first five years of his life after bungling NHS staff failed to notice there was anything wrong with him - despite the fact he couldn\u2019t see his bottle as a baby. Billy Wells, now 12, suffered from a deteriorating eye-condition that 'robbed him of his childhood' after it went undiagnosed for five years. Health workers that visited concerned parents Tracy, 43, and Charlie, 44, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, were too busy to properly diagnose the youngster and repeatedly told them to 'stop being silly'. Clear victory: Billy Wells, 12, and his father Charlie Wells. The boy has received a payout after he was left almost blind by NHS staff who failed to diagnose his eye condition . Billy (right) with his brother Danny at Disneyland Paris in 2007. Billy didn't look at the camera in any of the 200 pictures. He simply didn't know where it was . This was despite Billy seemingly being unable to see his milk bottle right next to him and as he grew older needed to sit one inch away from the TV to see it. He would also sit quietly in the living room while his boisterous older brothers ran around and barely moved when left alone. But alarm bells really started to ring for the couple when they returned from a trip to Disneyland Paris in 2005 and looked at their holiday pictures . They noticed that despite posing for over 200 photos - Billy hadn\u2019t looked at the camera in any of them. They then took him to an optician who diagnosed Billy with a deteriorating sight condition called hypermetropica amblyopia which had left him barely able to see. Billy would sit quietly in the living room while his boisterous older brothers ran around. He barely moved when left alone because of his poor vision .

At the heart of the debate: Would such quarantines on health workers who just came back from treating Ebola patients in West Africa help prevent the spread of the virus, or would they discourage medical aid workers from helping fight the global crisis? Here's what we know about the latest Ebola policies: . Who enacted tougher rules for health workers? New York, New Jersey and Illinois say anyone returning from having direct contact with Ebola patients in West Africa will have to be quarantined for 21 days. The 21-day period marks the maximum incubation period for Ebola. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn's office said the quarantine would be a \"home quarantine.\" \"This protective measure is too important to be voluntary,\" Quinn said. When New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced their new policies on Friday, they called for hospitalization or quarantine. But on Sunday night, after debate over the policies heated up, the governors said the quarantines could be carried out at home. Cuomo, Christie clarify policy on Ebola health worker quarantines . Would home quarantines even work? Depends on which side you ask. Neither Christie nor Cuomo explained how a home quarantine would work if family members were also in the home. It's also unclear how a home quarantine would or could be enforced if the quarantined person chose to leave the house. On the other hand, the governors say something had to be done; that asking returning medical workers to voluntarily quarantine themselves hasn't worked. Public health experts say there's plenty of scientific evidence indicating there's very little chance that a random people will get Ebola, unless they are in very close contact -- close enough to touch bodily fluids -- with someone who has it. Still, there's also a sense that authorities have to do something because of Americans' fears -- rational or not...",

The officials were defending intelligence community efforts at the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, during which Chairwoman Diane Feinstein, D-California, questioned whether the CIA and other agencies were adequately following clues in social media in the lead-up to popular revolts that deposed the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt and have sprung up in other countries. \"I think we were at fault in that regard,\" she said. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended the efforts of the open source center in tracking all media, but acknowledged more needed to be done. CIA Director Leon Panetta told the lawmakers there is a massive amount of data out there to follow -- 600 million Facebook accounts, 190 million Twitter accounts and 35,000 hours of YouTube videos. He said, \"The real challenge is how to be able, going through the diversity of languages, going through the different sites that are out there, how do we look at the relevant websites to be able to draw from them the kind of information that would help us so this involves a tremendous amount of analysis.\" Both Clapper and Panetta added that the social media sites are not necessarily predictive of what might happen. Clapper sought to clarify a comment that was roundly criticized when he said the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt was a \"secular\" group. He told the assembled senators that he regretted that his comment last week was misunderstood and that his message was lost. \"The Muslim Brotherhood is obviously not secular.

In recent days, the Israeli media has been full of personal attacks on U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry over a draft cease-fire document he transmitted last weekend. The State Department says what it sent was a \"clearly labeled confidential draft of ideas, sent in order to get Israeli comments, as part of an effort closely coordinated with the Israelis to explore a possible basis for a cease-fire.\" It was never intended to be an outright proposal demanding a yes or no answer from Israel. So administration officials were understandably shocked when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened an emergency meeting of his Security Cabinet, which voted unanimously to reject the document -- and it was quickly leaked to the Israeli media, promoting a firestorm of invective against Kerry. Although we don't know, and probably will never know, who leaked this confidential document, it is clear that this dispute serves the interests of those within the Israeli Cabinet who want to expand the military operation, possibly to encompass a temporary reoccupation of all of Gaza so Israel can destroy the Hamas military infrastructure and kill or capture its leaders and as many of its fighters as possible. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman is among those advocating that Israel \"go all the way\" by reoccupying all of Gaza. Some former generals are supporting him. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon oppose this idea, which some analysts believe could take several months and cost hundreds of Israeli and thousands of Palestinian lives with no certainty of ultimate success. Still, in recent days, Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders have started speaking of demilitarizing Hamas as one of their demands to end the fighting.

            "(CNN) -- A Warren Township, Ohio, man faces charges of felonious assault after authorities say he fired his rifle at two teens who were attempting to deface his McCain presidential campaign yard sign. Police say the man's sign is the only McCain sign on a street full of Obama signs. Kenneth Rowles, 50, pleaded not guilty to the charge Monday, according to CNN affiliate WBNS. Bail was set at $10,000. Rowles told police he was sitting on his porch Saturday when a tan SUV pulled up and a black youth jumped out and ran toward his house, screaming, \"This is for Obama.\" He said another male was hanging out of the passenger window screaming the same thing. Rowles said he went inside, got his rifle and fired three shots to scare the youths away, according to a Warren Township police report. He told officers he believes that the men \"were the same two that have been destroying his McCain sign.\" Just hours before the shooting, Rowles called police and said that a car had stopped in front of his house and that a black male \"ran up and said something about Obama,\" according to the report, and \"damaged his sign again.\" One of the youths, 17-year-old Kyree Flowers, was shot in the arm, according to a police report. He and the second youth, Patrick Wise Jr., 16, told police they were in the car attempting to leave when Rowles fired at them. \"Kyree stated that he witnessed the homeowner trying to shoot Patrick but he was having trouble chambering a round,\" the police report said. The teens admitted that they had defaced the McCain sign several times, Warren Township police Lt. Don Bishop told CNN. Rowles' is the only McCain sign on a street full of Obama signs, he said. Bishop said the teenagers probably will not be charged -- and are unlikely to damage campaign signs again, as the incident scared them.

            "(Wired) -- Like Optimus Prime or Al Gore, the Droid Bionic is a robot in disguise. Sure, the Bionic looks like it's just a massive, industrial-styled phone, just like our favorite Transformer looked like nothing other than a badass eighteen-wheeler. But the Droid Bionic can also change into a laptop, a desktop workstation, and other things which are decidedly un-phone-like. We've been waiting to see a finished version of this phone since Motorola first showed off the Bionic in January. Though it was supposed to launch months ago on Verizon's 4G LTE network, Moto sent the phone back to the drawing board for improvements (ostensibly to better stack up against HTC's 4G LTE offering, the Thunderbolt). The phone came back as a connectivity beast with lots of optional peripheral attachments, turning the Bionic into a successor of sorts to the Atrix, Motorola's most recent dual-core, peripheral-enhanced handheld. Moto's premise is simple: Our phones are increasingly becoming more powerful, useful and versatile in our everyday lives. Why not allow them to adapt \u2014 or transform, if you will \u2014 to what we need them to be in different situations? The \"Lapdock,\" for instance, is literally a laptop shell driven by the Bionic. After plugging the phone into the station on the back hinge, the Bionic launches Motorola's \"webtop\" interface, which is essentially a desktop-lite environment powered by the phone's hardware. There's a catch to all of this connectivity, however: You'll have to pony up a lot of dough. The Lapdock accessory will run you $300, while the HD station \u2014 which gives you access to the same interface but lets you use your own keyboard, mouse and display \u2014 costs a C-note. Add a car charger, HDMI mini-display adaptor and navigation dock to that, and you're closing in on $1000. That's a hell of a lot of money to spend on tricking out your phone, even if it's no longer just a phone once you plug these things in.

        "Sum the following article in brief: Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan will on Friday begin enforcing an evacuation order on a 20-kilometer zone around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, a top government official said. The restriction --in place since the early days of the nuclear disaster -- has often been ignored. Many of the about 78,000 people who have homes in the evacuation zone have gone back in recent weeks to retrieve belongings, and check on farms and businesses. No one will be allowed within 3 kilometers of the crippled nuclear facility and entry within 20 kilometers of the plant will be highly regulated, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters Thursday. People who temporarily return to their homes, businesses and farms must wear a protective suit and ride into the restricted zone on a designated bus. The time limit for such visits will be two hours and everyone who enters will be required to go through a decontamination process. The stricter enforcement within the zone is necessary \"to guarantee the health and safety of the people,\" Edano said previously, noting that Tokyo will work with local officials in closing the zone. Edano said the government plans to designate the area an \"alert zone\" under Japanese laws governing disaster response, a move he said would give authorities the power to crack down on people going into and out of the evacuated area. Police are currently stationed at checkpoints leading into the area, but enforcement appears to vary from post to post or officer to officer. A CNN crew entered the area for a short time Wednesday and encountered a young farmer whose family lives just inside the 20-km (12.5-mile) boundary.

Richard Roberts and wife Lindsay appear on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" last week. Lindsay Roberts, in a statement on the university's Web site, said the allegations against her \"sicken me to my soul. ... I live my life in a morally upright manner and throughout my marriage have never, ever engaged in any sexual behavior with any man outside of my marriage as the accusations imply.\" The suit, filed earlier this month, has drawn international attention to the private Christian school in Tulsa, Oklahoma, founded by evangelist Oral Roberts, father of university President Richard Roberts. The new allegations come in an amended version of the wrongful termination suit filed by three former professors, who say they lost their jobs after reporting that Roberts and his family lavishly spent school money for personal expenses. The amended lawsuit, filed Friday, also alleges that the university gave a \"convicted sexual deviant unrestricted access to students\" while the man acted as a \"mentor.\" The lawsuit also claims the university shredded evidence three days after the suit was filed against the school. The school denies both accusations in a statement on its Web site. The new allegations involving Lindsay Roberts come in a section titled \"Scandal Vulnerability Assessment.\" It says that photos show her and an underage male smoking at the president's residence and that she \"spent the night in the ORU guest house with an underage male on nine separate occasions.\" It also references 29 photos it says show her and an underage male alone in her car, time-stamped after midnight, despite a citywide 10 p.m. curfew for minors not with their parents.

Whether it's the local axe pop music powered by freight-train percussion or street musicians and blocos afro pounding out hypnotic riffs, big beats power Bahia in a way they do nowhere else in Brazil, maybe even the world. A state on Brazil's coast, Bahia is the center of the country's Afro-Brazilian culture, and the heartbeat of that is the drum. The state is home to percussion ensembles such as Ile Aiye and Olodum, a group of several thousand members famed for their work with Paul Simon, that make Carnival in Salvador one of the top attractions in Brazil. Percussionist Carlinhos Brown rose from drumming on empty water bottles in the streets of a poor neighborhood in Salvador to become one of Brazil's top hit makers and artists, not to mention a judge on \"The Voice Brasil.\" Brown founded the mostly percussion band Timbalada, a Carnival favorite, which takes its name from the conical hand drum known as a timbal.

While there is a wide range of possible outcomes in Libya, running from a static stalemate to Gadhafi cracking, there is a \"more than reasonable\" chance of Gadhafi leaving power, Adm. James Stavridis said before the Senate Armed Services Committee, . But potential \"flickers\" of al Qaeda and Hezbollah elements have been seen in intelligence regarding the Libyan opposition, which is poised to take power if Gadhafi leaves, Stavridis said. However, he added there is no evidence of a significant presence of al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. Stavridis is also the commander of U.S. European Command. \"The intelligence that I'm receiving at this point makes me feel that the leadership that I'm seeing are responsible men and women who are struggling against Col. Gadhafi,\" Stavridis added. The comments come the same day as U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with a leader of Libya's opposition in London. Clinton and the heads of 40 other countries met Tuesday to discuss Libya's future. A senior counterterrorism official, unnamed because he is not authorized to speak on the record, backed up Stavridis' assessment, downplaying the concern about al Qaeda among the Libyan opposition. There is probably \"a sprinkling of extremists to perhaps include al Qaeda\" in Libya among the rebels, \"but no one should think the opposition is being led by al Qaeda or one of its affiliates,\" the official said. Al Qaeda has had a presence in North Africa for years. It \"wouldn't be surprising if small numbers -- a handful\"-- of extremists or al Qaeda are in Libya. \"It's hard to tell who all the leaders are in the opposition,\" the official said, but \"the rebels do not appear to be adopting an al Qaeda bent or ideology in Libya.\" If Gadhafi's forces cease fighting there would be a...",

Riot police block a street on Thursday leading to a court building in Karachi, Pakistan. Thousands of lawyers planned a four-day march to the country's capital, Islamabad, on Thursday, demanding that the government immediately reinstate judges whom the previous president ousted. The protesters plan a sit-in at the parliament building on Monday, and say they will continue their demonstrations indefinitely until their demands are met. At the same time, the country's main opposition leader and his supporters have joined in the nationwide protests, but for reasons of their own. The government responded by banning political demonstrations in two of the country's biggest provinces -- Punjab and Sindh. It also detained several hundred activists Wednesday. The political chaos has forced the government's attention away from a deadly fundamentalist insurgency in its tribal areas and an economy that's on the verge of collapse. To understand the reasons behind Pakistan's latest political chaos, one needs to keep three central characters in mind: . What do the lawyers want? The lawyers want President Zardari to live up to a promise to reinstate judges sacked by former President Musharraf. Musharraf fired about 60 judges when he declared a state of emergency in November 2007. The fired judges include 14 of 18 judges who sat on the Supreme Court, including Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. Critics say Musharraf sacked the judges because they were preparing to rule against the legitimacy of his third term in office. He had been re-elected president by a parliament stacked with his supporters, they said. After sweeping into power in parliamentary elections last year, the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party promised to reinstate the judges within 30 days of taking office. The deadline came and went. Why have the judges not been reinstated? One reason behind the delay, some experts have...",

The freedom and beauty of the open road on a recent trip in the Pacific Northwest and California brought me back to what is really important in life. Vistas along the California coast near Mendocino can be breathtaking. My road trip started in Seattle, Washington, and ended two weeks later in Sacramento, California, covering 2,277 miles with a stunning backdrop of natural beauty along the way. Living in the moment and charting my own course gave me a sense of self empowerment that extends to my path in life and what I want out of it. For those who wish to set out on their own solo road trip, I recommend research and planning -- while still leaving time to be spontaneous. Hoh Rain Forest, Olympic National Park .

        "Summarise the article:\n\n(CNN) -- Utah doctor Martin MacNeill was found guilty of his wife's murder in a verdict read early Saturday morning. MacNeill showed no emotion as he learned his fate, but a yell came from the section where his relatives sat. He will be sentenced later on the charges of first-degree murder and obstruction of justice. MacNeill had said his wife's death was an accident. In the end, jurors believed prosecutors' allegations that MacNeill drugged and then drowned his wife, Michele MacNeill, in the bathtub of their home on April 11, 2007, to be with his mistress. MacNeill, who had been on trial for 22 days in Provo, Utah, had pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors alleged that his actions after his wife's death hindered the investigation, forming the basis for the obstruction of justice charge. However, defense attorneys said his wife, who was found with a powerful cocktail of prescription drugs in her system, died of natural causes. None of the medical examiners who worked on the case could determine definitively whether she died as a result of homicide. One of MacNeill's daughters, Alexis Somers, said she was happy with the verdict. \"There was justice for my mom today,\" Somers said. \"We are just so happy he cannot hurt anyone else.\" During his closing arguments Friday morning, prosecutor Chad Grunander pleaded with jurors to return a guilty verdict on both counts. \"Martin MacNeill murdered his wife, Michele. Her death was not the result of an accident, and it certainly was not the result of a heart condition,\" Grunander said. \"The defendant carried out a cold and calculated plan to murder his wife. He relied on his knowledge and experience as a doctor and also as a lawyer to accomplish this.\" In his closing argument, defense attorney Randall Spencer said prosecutors had simply not proved their case. \"There's not evidence in this case that rises to the level of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Spencer said. \"The prosecution has presented to you their cherry-picked versions...",

Some congressional Democrats are calling for an investigation into controversial CIA interrogation techniques. Those questions, focused on recently released Bush-era CIA memos detailing \"enhanced interrogations\" of suspected al Qaeda members -- are now being posed inside the Beltway, as calls by Democrats for an independent investigation into torture allegations have become louder. House Minority Leader John Boehner said Thursday that the release of what he described as the \"torture\" memos is politically motivated. \"Last week, they [Obama administration] released these memos outlining torture techniques. That was clearly a political decision and ignored the advice of their Director of National Intelligence [Dennis Blair] and their CIA director [Leon Panetta],\" Boehner said. The Ohio Republican pointed out that he saw a partial list of the number of members of the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans \"who were briefed on these interrogation methods and not a word was raised at the time, not one word.\" Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Michigan, also blasted concerns being raised by Democrats. \"Only now that we have a new administration are people coming out who were aware of these programs saying wait a minute, these were terrible programs. In reality, two, three years ago, they signed off on it, they voted for legislation that funded these programs, and now all of a sudden these are terrible practices,\" he said. But when asked whether or not she raised objections to the interrogation measures at the time, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- a then-ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee -- vehemently said \"we were not, I repeat, we were not told that waterboarding or other enhanced methods were used.\" \"What they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel ... but not that they would.

Glare from the rising sun and ice -- left over from a storm that dropped snow and freezing rain in the Philadelphia area -- might have been factors, state police Trooper Adam Reed said. The wrecks started around 8:25 a.m. ET with a 14- or 15-vehicle collision in southern Bucks County, not far from New Jersey state line, said Bill Capone, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. About 20 more sets of wrecks stretching for miles occurred on the turnpike, said Pat Ponticelli, Bensalem Township's deputy director of public safety. Each apparently happeed as traffic slowed for crashes ahead. In a number of areas, smashed vehicles were piled into each other with their front ends pointing in different directions, aerial video from CNN affiliate WPVI showed.

In his last stand at a special court for Sierra Leone, his last chance to address the world before he is locked behind bars, former Liberian President Charles Taylor made a plea for why he should be spared the harshest sentence for his conviction on aiding and abetting war crimes. He said he was saddened by last month's guilty verdict, in which the court said he had assisted Revolutionary United Front rebels who fueled Sierra Leone's long and bloody civil war that ultimately left 50,000 dead or missing. Taylor insisted his intent was far from what had been portrayed by prosecutors and that he, himself, was a victim. \"What I did to bring peace to Sierra Leone was done with honor,\" said Taylor, standing before the tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, dressed immaculately in suit and tie as he has been all throughout his trial. He delivered a 30-minute defense of his actions in a calm voice, his demeanor the opposite of the combative Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb commander whose war crimes trial opened Wednesday in another special tribunal, one for the former Yugoslavia, in The Hague. Not once, however, did he express remorse. \"I pushed the peace process hard, contrary to how I have been portrayed in this court,\" Taylor said. He blamed money for an unfair trial. \"Money played a corrupting, influential, significant and dominant role in this trial,\" he said. \"Money, in this case, prejudiced my rights and interests in a irrevocable way.\" He said prosecutors received millions of dollars from the United States government and witnesses were paid off.

Attacks over equipment shortages for British troops in Afghanistan, his failure to bow at a war memorial, and his misspellings in a condolence letter to a soldier's grieving mother all led one commentator to ask: \"Can't Gordon Brown do anything right?\" The Afghan and military issues dominated the British prime minister's monthly news conference at 10 Downing Street on Tuesday, taking up 40 of the 50 minutes he spent at the lectern. Brown stated over and over his sympathy for the families of fallen troops and his determination to see the war effort through. \"Each life lost is an irreplaceable loss from a family,\" Brown said. \"It reminds us all of the stark human cost of armed conflict in the service of our society.\" The latest embarrassment for the prime minister emerged Monday, when The Sun newspaper told the story of Jacqui Janes, who received the condolence letter from Brown after her 20-year-old son was killed by a bomb in Afghanistan. Janes told the paper she was \"so angry\" that the hand-written letter was filled with spelling errors -- including her own last name, which Brown spelled \"James.\" Brown also crossed out a mistake in spelling the soldier's name and spelled four other words wrong, the newspaper said. \"The letter was scrawled so quickly I could hardly even read it and some of the words were half-finished. It's just disrespectful,\" she told The Sun. \"He said, 'I know words can offer little comfort.' When the words are written in such a hurry the letter is littered with more than 20 mistakes, they offer no comfort.\" Brown called Janes to apologize after the article appeared, according to The Sun. Janes recorded the conversation and gave it to the paper, which recently announced on its front page that it was dropping support for Brown's Labour Party in favor of the Conservatives. The paper...",

Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets across Egypt over the military's actions that were decried by Morsy's supporters as a \"coup\" and celebrated as a \"correction\" by his opponents. At least eight people were killed and more than 340 wounded in sporadic violence that at times pitted Morsy's supporters against the opposition and the military. Morsy \"did not achieve the goals of the people\" and failed to meet the generals' demands that he share power with his opposition, Egypt's top military officer, Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi, said in a televised speech to the nation. Adly Mansour, head of the country's Supreme Constitutional Court, will replace Morsy as Egypt's interim president, El-Sisi said. Mansour was expected to be sworn in on Thursday. The military has not publicly commented on Morsy's whereabouts. But Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad El-Haddad told CNN the deposed president was under \"house arrest\" at the presidential Republican Guard headquarters in Cairo. He said some members of Morsy's inner circle have also put under house arrest. The country's constitution has been suspended, and Mansour will \"establish a government that is a strong and diverse,\" said El-Sisi, head of the country's armed forces. New parliamentary elections will be held, and Mansour will have the power to issue constitutional declarations in the meantime, he said. El-Sisi said the military was fulfilling its \"historic responsibility\" to protect the country by ousting Morsy, a Western-educated Islamist elected a year ago. Morsy remained defiant and insisted he was Egypt's proper president. \"The world is looking at us today,\" he said in a taped statement delivered to the Arabic satellite network Al Jazeera. \"We by ourselves can bypass...",

Charlene Fisk, a filmmaker from Atlanta, Georgia, tried her best not to lose it at Hartsfield International Airport on Monday at 4:30 a.m. when she found out she wouldn't be getting home to upstate New York anytime soon. Her US Airways connecting flight had been canceled, so she was placed on another flight to Philadelphia, which was then canceled. She's going to have to fly to Chicago on Monday evening, hopefully stay the night with friends and then hop on a standby flight to Syracuse. Her family will have to drive about an hour from their home to pick her up. \"Passengers are talking about renting cars together and just driving home,\" Fisk said. US Airways is picking up the tab to fly Fisk to Chicago. And while some airlines are offering refunds, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines said the company is providing weather waivers that allow passengers to reschedule without a penalty if they were scheduled to travel before Christmas. Another strong winter system will be developing by Tuesday in the Rockies. The system will take a track through the central Plains, Midwest, and into the western Great Lakes. Winter storm and blizzard watches are already in effect for the Central Plains for Tuesday night through Thursday. Severe weather also will be possible from Dallas and Houston, Texas, to Little Rock, Arkansas, and New Orleans, Louisiana. On Monday, CNN correspondent Susan Candiotti was taking her first day of vacation when she began a chaotic journey from Newark, New Jersey.

Is it good health, education, income, or job satisfaction? Is it the environment, a lack of crime, or having a say in politics? Those aspects of life can't be measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), long used as a key indicator of a nation's prosperity, British Prime Minister David Cameron says. Thursday, he launched a national survey to ask people which aspects matter most to them, and which they believe should be used to measure the nation's well-being. Though Cameron has championed this initiative since at least 2006, when he was still leader of the opposition -- suggesting a focus on GWB, or \"general well-being\" -- he still defended the idea Thursday against suspicions \"that all this is a bit airy-fairy and impractical.\" \"Of course you can't capture happiness on a spreadsheet any more than you can bottle it,\" he said in announcing the program. \"If anyone was trying to reduce the whole spectrum of human emotion into one snapshot statistic, I would be the first to roll my eyes, but that isn't what this is about. \"Just as the GDP figures don't give the full story of our economy's growth, but do give a useful indicator of where we're heading, so this new measure won't give the full story of our nation's well-being, but will give us a general picture of how life is improving.\" An online survey for individuals will run until April, when the Office for National Statistics (ONS) will send out surveys to large households. The results of both will be collected and analyzed, with results to come out in 2012, the ONS said. Cameron said he knows some think the project is a \"distraction\" from the more urgent economic problems Britain must address, and that some think there is no way the government can hope to improve people's well-being. Getting the economy moving, and creating jobs and spreading opportunity, is still the government's most urgent priority, Cameron said -- but there need to be better ways than just GDP to...",

There was little publicity for Seattle's first medical marijuana farmers market held on Sunday. No posters or signs were hung outside the market's venue, a small club where \"erotic poetry\" readings are held. Word of mouth alone though packed the hall as hundreds of people lined up to go in. They gained entrance with a recommendation from a health care provider stating that they need marijuana to treat a medical condition. \"I am actually standing upright because of cannabis, there's nothing else I found that would help me with chronic pain issues,\" said John Muise, a gaunt figure with long dangling dreadlocks. \"I couldn't even explain how my life would be if I didn't have cannabis. I would probably be addicted to opiates and in a wheelchair.\" Despite the packed crowds and stands full of marijuana, the farmers market operates in a legal gray zone. \"Medical marijuana is not legal in the state of Washington,\" said state Department of Health spokesman Donn Moyer. A law passed in 1998 allows for what is called the \"medical marijuana defense\" -- that allows for juries to take into account if someone charged with pot possession was taking the drug for health purposes. Under the current law, certain health care providers like doctors or nurse practitioner can issue the recommendations for medical marijuana for a variety of ailments including cancer, HIV and anorexia. But unlike in California or Colorado where medical marijuana initiatives led to an explosion of dispensaries that provide the drug, in Washington the medical marijuana community has remained, for the most part, underground. \"Dispensaries are not legal, co-ops are not legal here,\" Moyer said. \"The intent of the law is that you receive medical marijuana from a designated provider who can only help one patient at one time.

A murder plot was hatched and, police say, in the early hours of last Saturday morning, a Florida man was gunned down in his car. But the suspects apparently killed  the wrong man. Now four men are in custody, and will face charges of first degree premeditated murder and two counts of attempted murder. The four are Angel Cruz, 23; his brother from Oregon, Christopher Harter, 29; Peter MacDonald, 18; and Lernio Colin, 20. They have all appeared before a judge in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. They have not entered pleas and are being held without bond, according to state prosecutors. Detectives are executing search warrants today, and much about the case is still not known. \"The victim was with two other males, in the vehicle,\" said Mike Jachles of the Broward Sheriff's Office. \"One of those men was the intended target,\" Jachles told CNN.

The world's top two golfers were supposed to usher in a new era of dominance within the sport for Nike, but neither man made the cut on a disappointing day. The world No.1 finished on six-over, while Woods missed out after being hit with a two-stroke penalty for rules of infringement. Justin Rose finished top of the leaderboard on eight-under following a round of 69, but it was McIlroy and Woods who caught the headlines. Nike unveils Rory McIlroy: Tiger's heir apparent . McIlroy, playing with his new Nike clubs for the first time, had not missed a cut since the U.S. Open in San Francisco last June. But after starting the day well down the field following an opening round of 75, the Northern Irishman failed to battle back, despite reverting to his old putter. \"I just felt like the greens that I've been practising on are a lot faster than these,\" he told reporters. \"The Nike putter is great on that, but getting to here it's just a weight issue more than anything else. \"I can feel the head of the one I used today a little bit better, but the change was to no avail. \"I've got a few weeks off now to work at it and try and get my game in decent shape for the US.\" McIlroy had vowed to improve on his opening round and hit three straight pars, but three bogeys in the next four holes left him floundering on six-over. Birdies at eight and nine allowed some respite, but bogeys on the 10th and 14th ended his chances of making the cut at the course where he finished second last year. McIlroy teams up with Tiger at Nike . He said: \"I knew it was going to be a tough week with everything going on, but I was just looking forward to getting to the golf course and getting back to what I do and what I'm comfortable with. \"It just didn't work out like that.

            "(CNN) -- Western powers on Thursday were debating using military power against Syria's government to counter a chemical weapons attack in Damascus' suburbs last week. On Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama said there's no doubt that Syria launched chemical weapons attacks against its own people. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime has blamed the August 21 attack on rebels. Most recent: . -- The United States may have to take unilateral action against Syria after British lawmakers voted down a proposal for military action, a senior U.S. official said. -- British Prime Minister David Cameron was dealt a blow Thursday in his push for a strong response, including possible military action, against Syria after the House of Commons rejected the measure. -- The vote, 285-to-272, came just minutes after members of Parliament voted down a Labour Party motion calling for additional time for U.N. weapons inspectors to gather evidence over whether al-Assad's forces used chemical weapons in suburban Damascus. -- A closed-door meeting of the U.N. Security Council ended with no agreement on a resolution to address the crisis in Syria, a Western diplomat told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh on condition of anonymity. \"It was clear there was no meeting of minds, and no agreement on the text. It is clear that our approaches are very different and we are taking stock (of the next steps),\" the diplomat said. -- Members of the Security Council expect U.N. weapons inspectors to brief Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon shortly after they depart Syria on Saturday. Ban, in turn, will swiftly brief the Security Council on the findings, the diplomat said. Previously reported: . -- Cameron opened the emergency session of the House of Commons on Syria Thursday by saying the debate is about \"how to respond to one of most abhorrent uses of chemical weapons in a century\" -- not about regime change or invasion. -- Cameron told the House of Commons that the UK government would not act without first hearing from U.N. weapons inspectors, giving the..."

Even more immediately, at years' end we will face a $7 trillion fiscal cliff\u00e2\u20ac\u201da series of policies will kick in, from the blunt, across the board spending cuts (or sequester) to the expiration of the tax cuts that would reduce spending and raise taxes so abruptly and mindlessly it would put us back into recession. But ignoring and waiving the policies instead would add additional trillions to the debt and set us up for a fiscal crisis. A fiscal cliff or a mountain of debt. It will require presidential leadership to avoid either threat. While the likely approach will be to replace the slated policies with a gradual debt reduction plan that would bring the deficit down and leave the debt so that it is no longer growing faster than the economy, there are many different ways to achieve this -- all with pros and cons -- and many specifics that need to be filled in. However, the tendency during campaigns, of course, is for politicians to talk about what they promise not to do, rather than own up to the tougher decisions their stewardship would require. Instead of allowing the presidential candidates to duck and bob to avoid specifically saying how they would stem the flow of red ink, what if voters insisted that all presidential candidates directly answer the question, \"how would you fix the debt?\" Quite simply, candidates should not even apply for the job of running the country if they aren't willing to share the details of their approach for fixing the debt.

Navigate the city's streets and discover the many faces of Manila. It's a world away from carefully planned Asian cities like Singapore -- which makes it perfectly suited for visitors who don't need their lives hermetically sealed in air-conditioned shininess. Manila is alive with a mix of cultures, from Spain, China and the numerous Philippines islands. Sights to gawp at are thin on the ground, but the city streets have enough going on to enthrall even the most disinterested visitor. Though it was bombed to bits during the Second World War, Intramuros is one of the most coherent areas of the city. Worth a morning's visit, the old walled city's buildings (or rather what was left of them) were left untouched, even when the area was given an update in the 1980s. But it still retains a unique atmosphere in a city where the capital's expanding population is reflected in its growing sprawl. The Manila Cathedral was one of the buildings pummeled in the war, but the rebuilt version is faithful to the original 16th-century edifice. Fort Santiago, once the guarding fortress of the city and the Pasig River, is now a war memorial. Nearby is Rizal Park, a green spot named after the national hero. What he would have made of the moat outside the old city's walls being made into a golf course is anybody's guess.

A Delta IV rocket launches on March 10, 2003 at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Dongfan \"Greg\" Chung, 73, was accused of stealing restricted technology and Boeing trade secrets, including information related to the space shuttle program and the Delta IV rocket. U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney convicted him on charges of conspiracy to commit economic espionage; six counts of economic espionage to benefit a foreign country; one count of acting as an agent of the People's Republic of China; and one count of making false statements to the FBI, according to a statement from federal prosecutors. Carney presided over Chung's three-week bench trial last month. In a bench trial, there is no jury and the judge decides whether to convict a defendant after hearing testimony. Chung was free on bond after his arrest by FBI agents and NASA investigators in February 2008. He was taken into custody after Carney's ruling was read. Chung, a native of China who is a naturalized United States citizen, was employed by Rockwell International from 1973 until Boeing acquired its defense and space unit in 1996, and by Boeing thereafter. He retired from Boeing in 2002, but returned as a contractor, a position he held until September 2006, prosecutors said. Chung held a \"secret\" security clearance, authorities said. \"For years, Mr. Chung stole critical trade secrets from Boeing relating to the space shuttle and the Delta IV rocket -- all for the benefit of the government of China,\" said David Kris, assistant attorney general for national security, in the prosecutors' statement. \"Today's verdict should serve as a warning to others willing to compromise America's economic and national security to assist foreign governments.\" The case against Chung resulted from an investigation into another engineer who obtained information for China.

West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and French Prime Minister Robert Schuman's modest beginning to European integration -- to tie together the coal and steel industries of France, West Germany and the Benelux countries -- would over the next half-century become a behemoth of 27 states, many of which didn't even exist in 1952. That European Union vision is now at an historic crossroads and could over the next months begin to shred. A dysfunctional legacy . The European club has both expanded in number and deepened in purpose. Beginning as a common market with expensive subsidies to farmers, it evolved into a community with coordinated foreign and trade policies, open borders among many members, a common social policy and a powerful European Court. Vast sums have been spent on infrastructure for poorer members. Most notably, the Maastricht Treaty, named after the Dutch town where it was signed in 1992, began the process of monetary union and -- supposedly -- economic convergence among member states. The first part happened; the second did not. A \"stability and growth pact\" was meant to harmonize interest rates, inflation and government deficits. But there were no enforcement mechanisms beyond sharp words and a slap on the wrist. France and Germany were among the first states to breach the commandment that deficits shalt not exceed 3% of GDP. Some critics argue that Europe is like the python that swallowed a goat. In 1990, there were 12 members of the EU; now, the 27 members span an area from Lisbon to Tallinn, from Cyprus to Stockholm.

Francesco Schettino is under arrest and may face charges that include manslaughter, shipwreck, and abandoning a ship when passengers were still on board, according to Italian prosecutor Francesco Verusio. Schettino could face up to 15 years in prison, he said. At the closed hearing, a preliminary investigation judge will decide whether Schettino will remain detained. The captain has not yet been questioned, but more than 100 witnesses, including passengers and crew, have been interviewed, the prosecutor said. The captain's attorney, Bruno Leporatti, said in a statement Monday that Schettino was \"shattered, dismayed, saddened for the loss of lives and strongly disturbed.\" But, he said, Schettino is \"nonetheless comforted by the fact that he maintained during those moments the necessary lucidity to put in place a difficult emergency maneuver ... bringing the ship to shallow waters.\" That move, Leporatti said, saved the lives of many passengers and crew members. Italian prosecutors have ruled out a technical error as the cause of the incident, saying the captain was on the bridge at the time and had made a \"grave error.\" Overheard on CNN.com: Worst-case scenario strikes .

        "Could you please generate a TLDR (Too Long Didn't Read) summary of the following news article?\n\nArticle: (EW.com) -- Thanks to Man of Steel, Fast & Furious 6, Monsters University, and the surprising success of Now You See Me, the box office climbed to record levels in June, earning $1.25 billion \u2014 a 19 percent increase over June 2012. This week, Despicable Me 2 and The Lone Ranger, which both begin showing tonight to take advantage of the July 4th holiday weekend, will try to keep the box office firing on all cylinders. The former is poised to dominate the field, but the latter seems unlikely to lasso a big enough audience to justify its gargantuan budget. Here's how I think the box office might shake out over the Wednesday-to-Sunday period: . 1. Despicable Me 2 -- $125 million . The original Despicable Me was a surprise success in 2010, opening with $56 million en route to a $251 million finish. Adults enjoyed the sly edge of the animated feature, and their kids fell in love with the yellow \"minions,\" which became breakout characters in the same vein as Madagascar's penguins or Ice Age's acorn-chasing squirrel, Scrat. For Despicable Me 2, Universal is plastering the minions on any free ad space they can. The studio has inked licensing deals with Wal-Mart, Toys-R-Us, Progressive, Chiquita, Cheetos, McDonalds, and other national brands. Plus, they've got a \"Despicablimp\" flying around the country. But those promotional efforts wouldn't matter all that much if audiences didn't genuinely love the original \u2014 and boy did they. In fact, Universal could have a Shrek 2 situation on their hands here \u2014 while the original movie became a word-of-mouth smash (Shrek earned $267 million), the sequel could be a slam dunk right out of the gate (Shrek 2 wound up earning $441.3 million.). Despicable Me 2 does face animated competition from Monsters University, which has topped the chart for two weekends, but Despicable Me 2 is fresher in kids' minds, since its predecessor came out just three (not 12) years ago, and it's safe to say there's more built-in excitement for the young franchise. Opening in over 3,900 theaters, Despicable...",

The words \"Play ball!\" are the most dependable sign that spring has arrived in America.\u00a0Finally, baseball season is here. Maybe because it is an outdoor game, with a schedule stretching across three seasons.\u00a0Maybe because it is a child's game played by men, bridging the different times of our lives.\u00a0But the start of the baseball season is always greeted with relief, a sign of rebirth and hope, that this year appropriately coincides with Easter. Winter is over.\u00a0The bleak time has been survived.\u00a0And slowly but soon the familiar rhythms of life will reassert themselves. This, as it's referred to in the film \"Bull Durham,\" is the church of baseball, open to all. It is a sport more appropriately known as a pastime, \"the national pastime.\" The pace of the game is part of its charm -- meditation and strategy interspersed with furious action.\u00a0The sounds of the game are the background track to summer. As a sport played without a clock, a baseball game occurs out of time. It could theoretically go on forever. The past is always present in baseball -- it is \"a haunted game,\" as Ken Burns' documentary \"Baseball\" intones, with typically perfect pitch.\u00a0The best players of today compete not just with the players in their league, but the best players of all time.\u00a0Statistics are the unlikely portal to this bit of metaphysics. Fans can compare players of different eras and dream up their own all-time all-star team. This is another reason to love the game: Baseball can inspire young fans to see the fun in math and history. I am a Yankees fan, first minted in 1979, looking up at a poster of Ron Guidry, Willie Randolph and Greg Nettles -- meaning that I waited 17 years to see them return to World Series-winning form. It was a case of bad timing:\u00a0 I stayed true when just about everyone my age in New York was rooting for the Mets in their championship 1986 season.\u00a0This takes not quite as much character as remaining a Chicago Cubs fan, but it's somewhere in the same ballpark....",

        "In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?\n\nArticle: (CNN) -- Apple has acknowledged a problem with battery life on the iPhone 4S and other devices running its new operating system. The company says a software update coming \"in a few weeks\" will address the problem. The company previously had not publicly acknowledged complaints about battery life on the phone, which surfaced soon after it was released October 14 and continued to grow in the weeks since. \"A small number of customers have reported lower than expected battery life on iOS 5 devices,\" Apple said in a statement to AllThingsD, a part of the Wall Street Journal network. \"We have found a few bugs that are affecting battery life and we will release a software update to address those in a few weeks.\" Comments on a thread started October 15 in Apple's support forums to complain about battery life had grown to 217 pages by Thursday morning. Apple has declined to comment beyond its basic statement. Messages from CNN requesting information about the complaints were not returned. The poorer-than-expected battery life has largely been attributed to location-based apps and other power-draining features of the iOS 5 system. Some users have reported improvements when they disable time-zone and GPS features, while others have said the improvements were minimal. The apparent glitch is the second time in a row that a popular iPhone has experienced a highly publicized problem in its early days. And the responses, so far, have been similar. The iPhone 4 suffered from what some called the death grip, causing users who held the phone in a certain way to lose phone calls. Apple denied that there was a problem before eventually saying that it did, in fact, affect a small number of customers. The company eventually offered free cases, which improved the phone's reception. Neither time has the problem affected sales in a major way. The iPhone 4 is the most popular smartphone in the world, and the 4S is on track to perform just as well, starting with a reported 4 million sales in its first three days on the market.",

All of it's coming up in this Wednesday edition of CNN Student News. Hello, everyone. I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: State of the Union . AZUZ: The place: Washington, D.C. The event: An annual address to the nation steeped in history, and the response to it. U.S. President Barack Obama and U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, a Republican from Wisconsin, both took to the airwaves last night. CNN Student News brings highlights tomorrow. If you wanna watch the complete speeches, CNNStudentNews.com! You'll find 'em in the \"In Depth\" box. Click on \"State of the Union.\" Now, while we're on the subject of State of the Union, we are breaking down the history of the speech for you right now. First stop: U.S. Constitution, Article II, Section 3. \"The president shall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\" Now, that's what the Constitution requires; there are a lot of things that are traditions that are not required by the Constitution. For one, this address does not have to be annual, though a yearly speech dates back to George Washington. It doesn't need to be in person. In fact, our third president, Thomas Jefferson, had the speech delivered in writing to Congress. And the State of the Union doesn't need to be made at a congressional session of both Houses, though that's what we see every year, and what we saw last night. Here's why the State of the Union address is delivered in late January or early February: the 20th Amendment. It was ratified in 1933, and it specifies that congressional terms start on..."

        "Summarise the article:\n\nSportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as intriguing snippets from the Football League. 1. Brendan Rodgers tore up his belief in passing football to scrape the 1-0 over Stoke that earned Liverpool their first win in six matches. The Reds continually looked long to hit striker Rickie Lambert \u2013 they played just 433 passes in the 90 minutes which was 50 less than Mark Hughes side. Until Saturday Liverpool had averaged 545 passes per game in home Premier League games, and last season the Anfield average was 529. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers abandoned his approach to passing football to scrape a 1-0 over Stoke . 2. Frank Lampard\u2019s cameo at Southampton showed why Manuel Pellegrini is so desperate to keep him beyond the end of his current loan from New York Red Bulls which is due to end in January. It wasn\u2019t just the 36-year-old\u2019s goal \u2013 his fifth in a total of just 417 minutes of playing time since moving to Manchester City. Lampard also hit perfection with his passing, not once giving the ball away during his 25 minutes on the pitch. Frank Lampard of Manchester City  scores their second goal during Sunday's win over Southampton . City are keen to keep hold of Lampard until the end of the season in their push for the title against Chelsea . 3. Former Arsenal defender Kyle Bartley is emerging as a footballing centre half of genuine promise after taking his time to earn a first team chance at Swansea. The 6ft 4ins ex England Youth international who started his career at Bolton hit 73 accurate passes as Garry Monk\u2019s side built from the back against Crystal Palace \u2013 some 18 more than the entire opposition back four put together. Until November Bartley, 23, had started only one Premier League game in the two years since he moved to South Wales but could now make it hard for Argentina World Cup star Federico Fernandez to win his place back when he recovers from a calf injury.

        "Summarise the article:\n\n(CNN) -- Autopsy results indicate two American security officers found dead on the container ship Maersk Alabama last week died of respiratory failure, coupled with a suspected heart attack, police in the Seychelles said Tuesday. Further forensic analysis will be carried out to establish if the two men, Jeffrey Reynolds and Mark Kennedy, had consumed a substance that may have brought on these events, a police statement said. Traces of narcotics were found with the bodies of the officers, it said. \"The police preliminary investigation report includes suspicion of drug use, as indicated by the presence of a syringe and traces of heroin which were found in the cabin,\" the statement said. The two men, both 44, worked for Trident Group, a Virginia-based maritime security services firm. Trident Group President Tom Rothrauff said both were former Navy SEALs. The 500-foot Maersk Alabama was the target of an attempted hijacking in the pirate-infested waters off East Africa in 2009 -- an incident that inspired the 2013 film \"Captain Phillips.\" The shipping giant Maersk, which hired the Trident Group to guard its ships, said last week that Trident would be conducting random drug tests of its employees. \"Based on our experience with the contractor, this is an isolated incident,\" Maersk said. But it said new drug tests would start immediately and the company's shore leave policy was under review. Police said the ship arrived on February 16 in the Seychelles, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, with a 24-man crew and had been expected to leave two days later. The bodies were found last Tuesday by a colleague who had gone to check in with one of the men in a cabin, Seychelles police said. The Maersk Alabama has since left the Seychelles capital of Port Victoria.",

UEFA president Michel Platini is keen to revolutionize the tournament by holding matches across several European cities rather than just one or two countries. Platini is understood to have held talks with FA chairman David Bernstein last week about the semifinals and final being held in English capital. The Frenchman is keen for one city to host the final stages of the tournament with London a huge draw following its recent triumph in hosting the 2011 Champions League Final and more recently, the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The FA's chance of landing the showpiece event depends on whether Turkey, which is also keen to host the event, wins the right to host the Olympics in the same year. London successfully hosted the 2011 European Champions League final between Manchester United and Barcelona. That clash contributed to a record turnover of $532 million for UEFA and a profit after of tax of around $65 million, which was up from $14.5 million from the previous year. That game brought in $17.8 million for the FA and the governing body has already agreed a fixed rental price for next season's Champions League Final.",

            "Los Angeles (CNN) -- A lawyer for Michael Jackson's family seemed satisfied as he left the Los Angeles courthouse after the first week of the pop star's wrongful death trial. \"There's a long way to go and we hope the evidence supports -- and we believe it does -- that Dr. (Conrad) Murray was unfit for the job he was hired to do,\" attorney Brian Panish said. \"He was financially motivated and was in serious financial straits.\" Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, contending the concert promoter is liable in the pop icon's death because it hired, retained and/or supervised Murray, the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Murray's fatal treatment of Jackson with the surgical anesthetic the coroner ruled killed him was the result of the doctors' financial desperation and pressure from AEG executives to have Jackson ready for rehearsals for his comeback tour, Jackson lawyers argue. AEG contends it was Jackson who chose and controlled Murray, not its executives. The company had no way of knowing what treatments the doctor was giving the singer, who it said was an expert at keeping his \"deepest, darkest secret\" The trial's first witness was a paramedic who arrived at Jackson's home at 12:26 p.m. on June 25, 2009 to find a man who he initially thought was a hospice patient who had died after a long illness. Jackson lawyers see that description as support for their argument that AEG execs should have realized the frailty of Jackson's health. AEG lawyer concedes: Michael Jackson is dead . The second witness was the Los Angeles Police detective who led the investigation of Jackson's death. Orlando Martinez arrived at court Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday wearing a black cowboy hat, which he said is not part of his uniform as a homicide investigator, but \"the chief tolerates it.\" The trial is off until Monday, when the coroner's toxicologist will give scientific testimony about the drugs found in Jackson's body after his autopsy.

Records show that military personnel feared for the sanity of detainees in U.S. Navy brigs. Documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request quote an unnamed brig official writing about detainee Yaser Hamdi in June 2002. \"I will continue to do what I can to help this individual maintain his sanity, but in my opinion, we're working with borrowed time,\" he wrote.

The communication is one of several in which brig personnel expressed worries to superiors about the mental state of Hamdi, a dual Saudi/U.S. citizen who was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2001. Another e-mail about Hamdi written six months later, in December 2002, shows an unidentified military person appealing to higher-ups to be able to provide Hamdi with games and tapes to help him pass the time during confinement as a means to steady his mental state. \"I would like to have some form of an incentive program in place to reward him for his continued good behavior, but more so, to keep him from whacking [sic] out on me.\" A June 2003 e-mail reports that Hamdi \"feels as if he has been forgotten.\" \"The last thing I wanted to have happen was to send him anywhere from here as a 'Basket Case,' of use to no one,\" the author of the message wrote. \"I fear the rubber band is nearing its breaking point here and not totally confident I can keep his head in the game much longer.\" The Pentagon would not discuss the specifics of the newly released documents.

The 2010 World Cup semifinalists fell behind after 23 minutes when Hamburg's Paolo Guerrero latched onto a long ball up field before rounding Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera and rolling a low shot into the empty net. Liverpool's Suarez leveled for the two-time world champions when he converted from inside the penalty area after being released by Ajax playmaker Nicolas Lodeiro. Atletico Madrid forward Diego Forlan had a clear-cut opportunity to snatch all three points for Uruguay, but the 32-year-old fired his effort over the crossbar with only the goalkeeper to beat. Brazil held by Venezuela . The result left Chile top of Group C, after they came from behind to defeat Gold Cup winners Mexico 2-1. Nestor Araujo put Mexico into the lead after 40 minutes, when the Cruz Azul defender guided a looping header beyond Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo. Claudio Borghi's side equalized through substitute Esteban Paredes with the first of two goals from corner kicks, with the striker capitalizing on confusion in the Mexico backline to poke the ball home from close range.

        "Sum the following article in brief: Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- With 10 American Baptist missionaries in Haiti now charged with kidnapping for attempting to take 33 children out of the country, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday the case is for Haitian courts to decide. \"Obviously this is a matter for the Haitian judicial system,\" Clinton told reporters at the State Department. \"We're going to continue to provide support as we do in every instance like this to American citizens who have been charged and hope that this matter can be resolved in an expeditious way, but it is something that a sovereign nation is pursuing based on the evidence that it presented when the charges were announced.\" Clinton said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti is providing consular services and the American ambassador is speaking with his counterparts in the Haitian government. \"We have full access\" to the Americans, she said. A judge has not ruled on the missionaries' petition for bail, said their attorney, Edwin Coq. However, under Haitian law, anyone accused of kidnapping a child is not eligible for bail, the attorney general's office said earlier. The 10 missionaries, including group leader Laura Silsby, were charged Thursday with kidnapping children and criminal association. Haitian authorities split up the group, which was being held in a city jail, on Friday, Coq said. Coq said the five men have been sent to the national penitentiary, which was damaged in the massive January 12 earthquake that leveled much of Port-au-Prince. The five women have been sent to a prison in nearby Petionville. Court hearings will be held Monday and Tuesday for his clients, Coq said. Conviction on the kidnapping charge would carry a maximum penalty of life in prison; the criminal association charge would carry a penalty of three to nine years, according to a former justice minister. The Americans were turned back a week ago as they tried to take the children across the border into the Dominican Republic without proper documentation. They said they were going to house them...",

Yet on April 27, 2013, I weighed 219 pounds. At 3:30 a.m., I ate breakfast, hydrated, laced up my shoes and headed to Centennial Park in Nashville, because I was running the St. Jude Country Music Half Marathon. It had taken a village to get me to this day. This run was for Darbi, my best friend since college and her partner Anje, the two people that have taught me about the best me I can be. It was for Team Rio, the running group that became like family to me. It was for April, my CNN Fit Nation trainer. The 13.1 miles I was about to run weren't about the race itself, but about everything -- and everyone -- it took to get me there. Behind the scenes: Training for a triathlon . Anje is the biggest reason I've been able to lose more than 150 pounds. She became my trainer last June, then became one my biggest inspirations. In November 2012 Anje was diagnosed with uterine cancer. She and I had been working on getting me to my goal weight, which is how we decided to run a 5k and a half marathon in 2013. The plan was to do them together. I will never forget how scared I was, the anger I felt or the tears I cried, the day I heard her say, \"I have cancer.\" With a cancer diagnosis, Anje and Darbi should've been thinking about anything except me, but that's not the kind of hearts they have. Both were worried about how this was going to affect the plans Anje and I had made. So Darbi stepped in with her \"I got this\" swagger and picked up where Anje was forced leave off. I still wonder how she did it sometimes. She would work out with me, work endlessly, go to all of Anje's doctor appointments and take care of everything at home. I know she was terrified, but never once did she complain. She's a true testament to the human spirit. Anje's doctor decided she needed a complete hysterectomy, with possible radiation and/or chemo to follow, depending on what the surgery uncovered. Surgery was set for...",

        "Summarise the article:\n\n(CNN) -- A Washington state middle school boy was arrested after he brought 400 rounds of ammunition, multiple knives and a handgun to his school, intending to shoot another student who he thought was bullying his friend, police said. The 11-year-old was booked into a juvenile detention facility Wednesday after the incident that caused the lockdown of Frontier Middle School, Vancouver Police said. No one was injured. Authorities were alerted by the boy's mother, who called the school concerned that her son may have taken kitchen knives with him that day, according to a probable cause document. The boy was patted down by school resource officers who found the weapons and ammunition. The boy told school officials that \"a voice in his head was telling him to kill\" an 11-year-old classmate for calling the boy's friend gay, according to the probable cause document. \"He stated a voice told him killing (the classmate) was a good idea; however he planned to just shoot (the classmate) in the arm and then shoot himself in the head,\" the document said. The boy is being held on charges of attempted assault, unlawful possession of a firearm and possession of a weapon at school. He earlier faced a charge of attempted murder, but prosecutors did not immediately find sufficient evidence to support the charge. However, Kasey Vu with the Clark County Prosecuting Attorney's Office left open the possibility that the attempted murder charge could return when prosecutors receive more information from the investigation. The school in Vancouver was locked down for about two hours. Students were sent home with letters alerting parents of the situation, said Kris Fay, a spokeswoman for Evergreen Public Schools. The incident comes on the heels of several school-related violent incidents around the nation. On Monday, a math teacher was killed and two students wounded by a boy who then killed himself in a Nevada school.

        "In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?\n\nArticle: (CNN) -- SOPA appears to be dead. But the battle over Internet piracy is not. In the wake of the debate over the Stop Online Piracy Act, supporters of that now-abandoned bill are looking to Internet service providers for help; they're also taking other tacks that Web-freedom advocates say could have much the same effect as SOPA would have had. That bill, which came before the U.S. Congress earlier this year, would have made it easier to shut down websites that illegally share music, movies and other content. Opponents of SOPA, which included tech heavyweights such as Google, Facebook and Wikipedia, argued it was too broad and could effectively stifle expression online. Remember the Wikipedia blackout? It was in protest of SOPA. But the entire time, Internet service providers, at the behest of trade groups representing the entertainment industry, have been preparing to police such illegal sharing voluntarily and, potentially, shut down sites they think aren't playing by the rules. Those actions could have the same effect that SOPA would have. According to a leading recording industry spokesman, service providers such as Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, Cablevision and Time Warner Cable are expected to begin enforcing ramped-up anti-piracy policies in the next few months. (Time Warner, CNN's parent company, supported the legislation. Time Warner Cable is no longer affiliated with the company.) \"Each ISP has to develop their infrastructure for automating the system,\" Cary Sherman, CEO of the Recording Industry Association of America, said this week at a publishers conference in New York. \"Every ISP has to do it differently, depending on the architecture of its particular network. Some are nearing completion, and others are a little further from completion.\" The Copyright Alert System, which the recording industry's trade group first announced in July, has alternately been called a \"gradual elevation\" approach or the \"six strikes\" plan because of the warnings that providers would give before curbing a user's Internet...",

Mangala's transfer, confirmed Monday, comes just three months after City was heavily sanctioned by European football body UEFA for breaching new rules on Financial Fair Play. Whatever the deal's financial implications, City manager Manuel Pellegrini believes the 23-year-old Mangala has \"all of the mental, physical, technical and tactical attributes to become one of Europe's very best defenders.\" Pellegrini added on the City website: \"Eliaquim is a player I believe will make an immediate impact in the Premier League, thanks to his physicality, his reading of the game and quality on the ball.\" Mangala, who began his professional career at Belgian club Standard Liege, was part of France's 2014 World Cup squad but did not play in any games. \"For me, it was an important step to leave Porto and join Manchester City in order to continue my progress. I want to win titles and I believe I can do this. I am ambitious and this is why I am here,\" Mangala told the City website. In May, the English champions accepted a UEFA fine of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60 million ($82 million), a restriction on transfer spending and a reduction in the club's squad size for the European Champions League. Mangala is City's fifth permanent signing since last season, following his former Porto teammate Fernando -- who cost $20 million -- to England. Argentine goalkeeper Willy Caballero joined for a reported $10 million from Pellegrini's former club Malaga, while compatriot Bruno Zuculini was acquired for $5 million from Racing Club. Mangala's fellow France World Cup teammate Bacary Sagna moved from Arsenal on a free transfer, while veteran midfielder Frank Lampard will play on loan from City's American feeder club New York City FC.

            "Napa, California (CNN) -- Many high-school-age students are hooked on their phones and computers. Instead of fighting the kids, some schools like the public New Technology High School in Napa, California, are jumping right in and embracing the technology. \"We meet kids where they live,\" New Tech Principal Michelle Spencer said. Where they live is increasingly online, on instant messenger and Twitter. The school encourages students to bring in their own computers and to embrace tools like Gchat and YouTube in school and as part of their lessons. New Tech High School, founded in 1997, is the oldest member of the New Tech Network, a national nonprofit organization that schools hire to implement project-based learning and embed the use of technology with teachers and students. The New Tech Network has gone on to work with 120 schools of varying grades and budgets, but the Napa high school is a unique look at how the next generation of schools might work with modern technology, not against it. Responsibility online . Giving high school students unrestricted access to technology presents its own challenges. The decision to trust students online and even encourage them to build up a public presence is the opposite of what's happening these days in many schools, where strict social-media policies, Internet filters and constantly evolving rules are meant to rein kids in. \"Teach responsibility. That's the better battle to choose,\" Spencer said. All students at New Tech are trained in digital citizenry and responsibility, with teachers constantly emphasizing awareness of how things posted online will never go away. These lessons come at a key time, educators there say: early enough to prevent students from sharing the irresponsible photos or posts that seem to be a rite of passage for the Internet generation. The teachers are also active on Twitter, bantering with students and using the social network as a teaching tool in their lessons. Any errors of judgment the students may make along the way are treated as teaching..."

Her husband is with her in the hospital, where she is expected to remain for seven to 10 days. \"I am very impressed with and grateful to the wonderful team of doctors and nurses at The Methodist Hospital who have helped Barbara,\" the former president said. \"We have every confidence she is in the best hands.\" The open-heart surgery was taken as a precautionary step after she experienced shortness of breath last week and doctors found hardening on one part of her aorta, according to a statement released by the hospital. Dr. Gerald Lawrie performed the 2 1/2 hour surgery, replacing her aortic valve with a biologic valve, the hospital said. \"This is a very common aging change,\" Lawrie told CNN's \"Larry King Live.\" \"It's estimated as many as 10 percent of people over 70 need this type of surgery. It's basically a wear-and-tear that leads to calcium deposits.\" Lawrie said the former first lady \"really should\" recovery quickly with the new aortic valve taken from a pig. \"That's what we use most commonly,\" he said, adding that Bush \"woke up from the surgery joking.\"",

Citing an unnamed source, The Unofficial Apple Weblog is reporting that, in addition to unveiling the iPhone 5 next week, Apple plans to discontinue the more dated versions of its music player in favor of sleeker models like the iPod Nano and iPod Touch. The blog notes that Apple teased a \"product transition\" during its most recent earnings report. Saying only that the source is not an analyst, TUAW says the rumor makes sense. \"The classic is a holdover from 10 years of iPod existence, bearing many similarities to the original iPod,\" wrote blog editor Victor Agreda, Jr. \"The shuffle is basically the same form factor as the nano, minus a screen.\" He writes that the blog had been \"sitting on a tip\" about the discontinuation and only wrote about it after speculation popped up on other sites. A groundbreaking device in personal tech, credited with reinvigorating Apple a decade ago, the iPod line now accounts for just about 7 percent of Apple's overall revenues. The iPhone and iPad, which offer music and video streaming along with lots of other features, have in some way trumped the iPod's usefulness. Last year, Apple made what then-CEO Steve Jobs called \"the biggest change in the iPod lineup ever.\" But amid big changes to the Touch, Nano and Shuffle, there was no mention at all of the classic iPod, leading many to speculate that the end may be near.",

            "As millions of Taiwanese headed for the polling stations across the nation last weekend, there was a general sense that change was at hand. As the results of the vote started trickling in during the evening, it soon became clear that the political scene in Taiwan was about to become a much different place. It was a rout. When it was all over and done, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) had merely won six of the 22 constituencies in the mayoral and commissioner elections, while the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won 13, and did so with sizable leads. Moreover, the KMT had lost control of Taipei, the capital city it had run for 16 consecutive years, to an independent with no political experience, and also saw safe cities in the northern half of the island, such as Hsinchu and Taoyuan, slip through its fingers. In all, it lost nine of the 15 cities and counties it used to control. Overall, the DPP garnered 5.83 million votes, or 47.6%, against the KMT's 4.99 million (40.7%). However, if we factor the votes that went to independent candidates who are ideologically close to the DPP, the \"green camp\" accounted for a solid 6.88 million votes. Discontent with the KMT alone doesn't sufficiently explain the DPP's performance; the latter, including leader Tsai Ing-wen, worked tirelessly in the lead-up to the elections, and for the most part fielded candidates of quality. In the wake of catastrophe, Premier Jiang Yi-huah and KMT Secretary-General Tseng Yung-chyuan, as well as 80 members of the Cabinet, have resigned, and it is now rumored that President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as KMT chairman, could step down from the latter position on Wednesday. Lazy campaigns? There are sundry reasons for the defeat. In many constituencies, including Taipei, the KMT ran lazy campaigns and spent more time attacking its opponents than trying to convince voters of the virtues of its own candidates. More importantly, Ma and his party have become highly unpopular. After six years of rapprochement with Beijing, and the signing of..."

Shoppers decked out in the last fashions prowl shining new shopping malls. It's about two hours drive from the glamorous metropolis of Shanghai, yet it's fair to say very few people outside of China have heard of it. But now, Changzhou has landed right in the middle of a U.S political firestorm. It's all about jobs: American jobs shipped to China.

It makes sensors for cars. Sensata is controlled by the private equity firm Bain Capital, and that is where Romney comes in. Romney is one of the founders of Bain Capital. And although he left the company years before it bought Sensata, he can't escape the political fallout. Outside the Sensata factory gates, we managed to catch a group of workers on their lunch hour. We talked with them quickly to avoid drawing the attention of company security guards. I asked one worker whether he knows who Mitt Romney is. \"No,\" he said. \"You don't know who he is? He's running for president of the United States,\" I explained. \"Really? I don't know,\" he said. They may not be up to speed on U.S. politics here, but they know a lot about the economy, about how incomes are rising even if it is at the expense of American workers. \"It's determined by the market: Jobs go wherever labor is cheaper. It makes sense,\" one worker said. \"Do you like America?\" I asked another. \"So-so,\" he said.

Police fired tear gas and stun grenades in an effort to disperse the activists, who were armed with clubs, batons and shields but did not appear to be carrying firearms. Some of the activists smashed windows and broke down doors as they sought to enter the building. \"We're going floor to floor looking for people ... for the people who were here beforehand,\" one of the militants said.

Sunday's disputed, last-second field goal by the Baltimore Ravens that gave them a 31-30 win over the New England Patriots first set tongues wagging. But that uproar was comfortably outdone the next night by an even more controversial, game-winning score -- this one by the Seattle Seahawks, which resulted in their narrowly defeating the Green Bay Packers. This play -- both the lack of a blatant offensive pass interference call and officials' determination that Seattle's Golden Tate deserved a touchdown, despite evidence indicating the ball was intercepted -- spurred vitriol on Twitter and criticism from pundits and fans alike. For many, it illustrated the credibility problem plaguing the league during its season's first three weeks with replacement officials on the field, in place of regular referees who were locked out by the NFL in a prolonged contract dispute. This storm subsided late Wednesday, when NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell temporarily lifted the lockout to allow the \"regular\" referees to officiate Thursday's game between the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens. NFL officials remain locked out until a new collective bargaining agreement is voted on by the union membership. About time,' players, fans say as NFL officials return . Goodell has had his critics, including those up in arms over the league's handling of the latest officiating issues. But it is worth pointing out that the sport has at times been a trailblazer in the field of technology, making soccer -- or football as it's known outside the United States -- look like it is still stuck in the dark ages. The NFL introduced an instant replay system in 1986, allowing officials to review and possibly overturn calls on the field. This system at first didn't take and was scrapped, but an improved replay system was reintroduced in 1999. Since then, instant replay has been a key feature of the sport, with coaches allowed to challenge a call. Each...",

French President Francois Hollande insisted signing up to the euro bloc was \u2018for life\u2019 and ruled out allowing the UK to take back powers already surrendered to Brussels. Mr Cameron will use a major speech in the New Year to spell out set out his vision on Britain\u2019s place in the European Union, offering a referendum on a new settlement. What entente cordiale? French President Francois Hollande warned David Cameron he could not treat Europe like an 'a la carte' menu, scuppering hopes of Britain bringing powers back from Brussels . The PM is expected to reveal the results of a coalition review of EU powers which he wants to repatriate, including justice, business and employment regulations. But Mr Hollande signalled his opposition to the idea, arguing the 27 member states must sign up to the EU\u2019s entire policy programme. It raises the prospect of France blocking any attempt by Britain to negotiate a new relationship with Europe, scuppering Mr Cameron\u2019s hopes of placating a growing band of Eurosceptics on the Tory benches.

        "Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?\n\nArticle: (CNN) -- The U.S. Justice Department is suing the state of California and Gov. Jerry Brown because prison authorities required a Sikh prison inmate to cut his beard. The lawsuit was filed Tuesday on behalf of Sukhjinder Basra, an inmate at prison in San Luis Obispo in central California. It said that the requirement violated the man's right \"to practice his religion\" under the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLIUPA). In the Sikh religion, which originated in northwestern India, unshorn hair is an article of faith. The Justice Department said the suit followed a probe \"that revealed that California's inmate grooming policy substantially burdens the rights of an inmate to practice his Sikh faith. \" \"The rights guaranteed by the Constitution extend to all people in the United States,\" said Andre Birotte Jr., U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California.  \"By protecting those rights -- even for those incarcerated -- we strengthen those rights for all.\" The state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation was also named in the suit. RLUIPA, which became law in 2000, protects the religious freedom of people \"confined to institutions such as prisons, mental health facilities and state-run nursing homes,\" the Justice Department said.",

            "(CNN) -- Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donte Stallworth was charged in Florida on Wednesday with killing a pedestrian while driving under the influence, a spokesman for the Miami-Dade County state attorney's office said. Cleveland Browns wide receiver Donte Stallworth has been charged with DUI manslaughter . Authorities charged Stallworth, 28, with DUI manslaughter in the death of Mario Reyes, spokesman Ed Griffith said. Stallworth is expected to surrender in court Thursday, Griffith said. The charge is a bondable offense, and bail is expected to be set at $200,000. If convicted, he could face up to 15 years in prison. According to Griffith, Stallworth's blood-alcohol level after last month's accident was measured at 0.126 percent, higher than the state's legal limit of 0.08 percent. Stallworth was drinking at a Miami Beach, Florida, club early March 14, court documents say. He later left the club and went to a Miami residence for about 45 minutes before leaving in his black Bentley GT at 7:07 a.m. He was driving east on the MacArthur Causeway, which connects Miami to the South Beach area of Miami Beach, when he struck Reyes, prosecutors said. Reyes, a construction worker, was crossing the eastbound lanes of the causeway. CNN affiliate WSVN reported that he was heading to a bus stop after leaving work. Reyes, 59, was struck by the right front and fender of the car and suffered critical  head, chest and abdominal injuries, according to an affidavit. He died a short time later at a hospital. Read the affidavit (PDF) Stallworth told the arriving officer, \"I hit the man lying in the road,\" the affidavit said. He said he had time to honk his horn and flash his headlights to alert Reyes, according to the documents.

Perhaps it is because of the irony of the buff actor coming to fame in the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise to then lose his life in a car crash. Or maybe it is due to the fact that at the age of 40, his death was so unexpected and means he will now forever be frozen in time in the minds of fans -- defined not only by his roles and his philanthropy, but also by the footage of a smoking wreck which trapped him and his friend Roger Rodas. 'Fast & Furious' star Paul Walker killed in car crash . Here are 5 things we know so far about the story: . 1) Authorities are focusing on the car and how fast it was going . The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office has said speed was a factor in the crash, which occurred after Walker hopped in Rodas' 2005 Porsche Carrera GT for a ride, according to witnesses. The rare vehicle has three times the horsepower of an average car and is reportedly not easy to handle. Both Rodas and Walker were experienced drivers and had raced in competitions before. 2) Toxicology tests are not yet in . According to an autopsy report from the Los Angles County coroner's office, results of toxicology testing, which would show if drugs or alcohol played a role in the accident, won't be available for six to eight weeks. Both men's deaths have been officially ruled an accident. 3) Production of 'Fast & Furious 7' is on hold . \"At this time we feel it is our responsibility to shut down production on 'Fast & Furious 7' for a period of time so we can assess all options available to move forward with the franchise,\" Universal Pictures said in a statement. Walker was on Thanksgiving break from filming the latest movie in the franchise in Atlanta at the time of the accident. A source close to the production told CNN that the studio is trying to figure out how to move ahead with a movie featuring fast cars and crashes, given that one of its stars was so tragically killed in an accident. Editors have been reviewing footage that had...",

She looked down as she spoke, only glancing up from her dark round eyes every now and then. She wanted to tell more, but she was too ashamed. She was just 9 years old when, she says, Congolese soldiers gang-raped her on her way to school. The young girl on the right says she was raped by Congolese soldiers. She was just 9 when it happened. \"These two soldiers nabbed her, put a bag over her head and pulled her into the bushes. She explains it as, 'They got me,' \" says Sherrlyn Borkgren, who spent a month in the Democratic Republic of the Congo late last year. Borkgren, a wedding photographer and freelance journalist, traveled to the war-torn region of eastern Congo after being awarded the ShootQ Grant, a $10,000 award to free photographers from everyday life to pursue a project that raises awareness of an important global issue. Borkgren pauses when she speaks of meeting the girl. \"She was obviously very traumatized to repeat this out loud, and I don't think she had repeated it to anyone.\" The young girl lied to her about her age when they first spoke. \"She said she was 15 when she was raped,\" Borkgren says. \"I figured she probably wanted to say she was 15 because it's more acceptable than to say, 'I was 9 when they raped me.' \" The United Nations estimates 200,000 women and girls have been raped in Congo over the last 12 years, when war broke out with Rwanda and Uganda backing Congolese rebels seeking to oust then-Congo President Laurent Kabila. Rape became a weapon of war, aid groups say. \"It is one of the worst places in the world to be a woman or girl,\" says Anneke Van Woudenberg, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch who has spent the last 10 years focusing on Congo. \"These are often soldiers and combatants deliberately targeting women and raping them as a strategy of war, either to punish a community, to terrorize a community or to humiliate them.\" Most times, the women are raped by at least two perpetrators. \"Sometimes, that is done in front of...",

The committee passed up a chance to give a tangible boost to and put the valuable global spotlight on an individual, a cause or an organization that could really benefit from the award. What a sadly missed opportunity. Peace Prize is a slap on the back for a struggling European Union .

There's only one Malala, but there are countless people around the world doing heroic work every day, many risking their lives to end tyranny, hunger and illiteracy. I have nothing against the EU. It has accomplished important things, and the Norwegians who award the Peace Prize surely wanted to give it recognition during a time of economic turmoil and political tension in Europe. Still, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wasted the moment. We are living through a time when competing forces are fighting for radically different visions of the future. Activists for democracy, for women's rights, for religious tolerance have faced off against state security forces, religious extremists and brutal misogynists. Zealous prosecutors, loyal to authoritarian regimes, have imprisoned artists, executed homosexuals and tortured democracy activists. Those permitted to nominate candidates gave the panel ideas, a dazzling collection of extraordinary organizations and individuals. The list will remain secret for half a century, but that didn't keep people from speculating about who might win.

Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said Wednesday that answering questions about social responsibility is now part of the bidding process. The revised bid specifications include six questions intended to gauge the gun manufacturer's responsibility to public safety, according to city documents. The answers will impact the firm's competitiveness, Fulop said. Refusal to answer the questions will deem their proposals incomplete. The six questions are: \"What do you do to combat illegal gun trafficking and illegal gun crime? Do you manufacturer and sell assault weapons for civilian use? Do you agree not to sell certain models of firearms for civilian use? Are you requiring your dealers to conduct background checks? Do you fund research related to gun violence and smart gun technology? Will you commit to prohibiting your brand name from being used in violent video games?\" An admitted gun control advocate who also happens to have military background, Fulop said he hopes to make Jersey City a national example for other cities. Jersey City is believed to be the first in the country with such a requirement, the mayor said. Fulop said social responsibility requirements exist for most industries and that the gun manufacturers should not be exempt. As expected, the initiative has its detractors. \"It is inappropriate to politicize the selection of firearms for law enforcement,\" said Lawrence Keane, senior vice president and general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a Connecticut-based firearms trade association. Keane said it is dangerous to select firearms for law enforcement on anything other than what is best for police officers.

And we have a fabulous stadium, but I think it cost more than all the covered stadia in North America put together, \" said Dick Pound, former International Olympic Committee vice-president and a prominent resident of the Canadian city. However, Pound said calling the Montreal games of 1976 \"the bankrupt Olympics\" is a bad rap, and pointed out that the games actually made money. He said they paved the way for a new financial structure and the introduction of lucrative new television rights deals. People still come up to him and remember how well the Montreal games were staged and, in the end, how exciting they were, he added. \"They were pretty magic. All Olympics are magic but we had Comaneci with her first '10' and we had the Spinks brothers and we had Sugar Ray Leonard,\" he said. \"I mean we had some magnificent heroes of the modern Olympics.\" But there is weariness in Montreal about being known for staging the Olympic games that almost bankrupted a city. The city's mayor at the time, Jean Drapeau, famously remarked that if the games end up having a deficit, men will have babies. And it was in large part due to the Olympic Stadium construction that the statement seems so ridiculous now.  The Olympic debt was nearly US$1.48 billion, and the stadium itself has been an engineering nightmare -- the retractable roof has struggled to worked properly over the years and almost forced the closure of the entire arena last year amid safety concerns. But the city's current government insists Montreal has put that legacy behind it and the Olympic stadium is now a key attraction. \"Now it is paid, and it's profitable for Montreal to keep it,\" said Manon Barbe,...",

Fresh on the heels of the infamous Red Wedding, Sunday's \"Game of Thrones\" served up more murderous matrimony. But, with what fans have dubbed the \"Purple Wedding,\" many of us finally got something we'd been hoping for since season one. As the loathsome King Joffrey lay on the ground doing his best impersonation of Violet Beauregarde from \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,\" one question sprung to mind after the obligatory high fives: Who did it? Certainly there is no shortage of folks who would have loved to off the sadistic, smug boy king. Here, we run down some of the key suspects and why they may have been behind the deadly deed. Let us know your theory in the comments (and, book readers, no spoilers, please!) Tyrion . He's obviously Cersei's top suspect. And it's not like he doesn't have reasons. There was no love lost between Tyrion and his nephew (remember the much-celebrated slap?) even before Joffrey went out of his way to humiliate him repeatedly, both before and after the wedding. Slicing up his gift of a rare and priceless book? Check. Wine on the head? Check. Trying to force him into a humiliating performance at the feast? Check. Was it all just too much for Tyrion? Not hard to imagine. Sansa . And then there's Tyrion's wife. Joffrey was responsible for the deaths of her father, mother and brother. And that's on top of having her publicly beaten and tossing her aside for a more politically useful marriage. (Not that she wanted anything to do with him by that point.) Sansa may be as close to an innocent as still exists in King's Landing. But what better time than Joffrey's wedding day to exact some revenge? Oberyn Martell . \"The Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts.\" When the Martells sent fiery warrior Oberyn to the wedding in place of his brother, Prince Doran, it was a not-so-subtle hint that they haven't forgotten, or forgiven, that Oberyn's sister, Elia, was raped and killed by Gregor \"The Mountain\" Clegane, who serves the Lannisters.

A hurricane warning was issued for Tecpan de Galeana to Lazaro Cardenas. As of Sunday night, Raymond was 155 miles west-southwest of Acapulco. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, with higher gusts, and was moving north at 6 mph. Raymond strengthened rapidly and was expected to continue to strengthen. The storm is forecast to near the coast within the hurricane warning area late Monday or Tuesday. It is predicted it will take a sharp turn west before it has a chance to reach land, the hurricane center said. Raymond is forecast to dump heavy rain along the south-central coast of Mexico, with between 2 to 4 inches and up to 8 over the state of Guerrero. The area was hit hard by another storm in September. The previous storm, Manuel, triggered deadly mudslides and left about 40,000 tourists stranded in Acapulco, a popular tourist destination."

The rate has not dipped below that number since November 2008, two months before Barack Obama became president. His defenders point out that the nose dive in jobs began under President Bush; his detractors counter that Obama has not exactly proven a wizard at reversing the trend.

Joe W. Gordon, whose Thai name is Lerpong Wichaicommart, cooperated during the investigation of his case and pleaded guilty, resulting in a lenient sentence, his lawyer said. But the charge of writing and posting articles insulting the monarchy under the Southeast Asian country's lese majeste laws can yield a sentence as high as 20 years in prison in the Buddhist country, where the king is highly revered. \"A chokehold on freedom of expression is being created in the name of protecting the monarchy,\" Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a report published December 2 on the laws. King Bhumibol Adulyadej has pardoned foreigners in similar cases in the past. The lawyer, Anon Rumpa, said he plans to file for a royal pardon. Speaking to reporters after the verdict, Gordon said he was \"an American, not a Thai citizen.\" An \"American has rights and freedom to comment. In Thailand, there is limitation in expressing opinion,\" he said. Gordon, 54, returned to Thailand last year after 30 years in the United States.

Backpacks are back in fashion thanks to the increasing necessity of busy Britons needing to be hands-free as they move around. For this once humble symbol of the budget traveller is the new brief-case, hand bag and holdall, rolled into one, according to the latest research. High Street retailer Debenhams reported yesterday that it has seen a 114per cent increase in sales of backpacks which industry observers attribute to the increasing use of smartphones as they leave the wearer's hands free to text, tweet, or surf the internet. A Nineties favourite, the utilitarian carry-all has been given an upmarket make-over and become the surprise must-have accessory of 2014. Model of the moment Cara Delevingne has given the trend the ultimate stamp of approval by unveiling her own backpack collection for exclusive Brit brand Mulberry this week, while trend-setters like Alexa Chung and Rihanna, have been seen enjoying the benefits of the reborn-rucksack. According to fashion insiders the secret to this look is to remember - size matters. Debenhams Head of Accessories Design, Natelle Baddeley said: 'Too small and you look like you are still stuck in the Nineties, too big and you may be mistaken for an actual backpacker! 'The key size is medium, get that right and the wonderful versatility of the backpack is immediately apparent.

George Eustice (pictured), the Parliamentary under-secretary of state for farming, food and the marine environment, said labels informing consuemrs over how the animal was killed could give 'clear definition' In May, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg demanded better labelling of meat and suggested suppliers used a designated 'halal' logo. It also emerged that major supermarkets such as Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Waitrose and Marks and Spencer were selling the imported meat, while popular restaurant chains such as Pizza Express had been serving halal chicken without making it clear on the menu. Halal meat comes from the traditional Muslim method of slaughtering but is controversial because animals are killed by having their throats cut and then having their blood drained. The European Commission is set to report early next year on whether meat sold in the European Union should be labelled.

Now, 120 years later, Zink says: \"Just add paper\" and do it yourself. Zink is a zero-ink printing company that has updated the instant gratification that comes from developing pictures for the digital age. The pleasure of snapping a picture and admiring the print hasn't changed, but the technology has, plus there is a new eco-friendly element. Zink paper is an advanced composite material with embedded yellow, magenta and cyan dye crystals that change color when heated. For a 2\"x3\" print, a Zink-enabled printer uses 200 million heat pulses to activate and colorize 100 billion crystals, in 30 seconds, in a single pass. The final result is a photographically correct print that is not only completely dry, but also waterproof, smudge-proof, tear-proof, peel-off and sticky-backed -- not to mention recyclable. If Zink's thermal printing process sounds familiar, it differs from D2T2 (dye diffusion thermal transfer), or dye sublimation technology, used by other companies such as Kodak, Canon or Sony, in one crucial aspect -- Zink involves zero ink. \"The source of heat conveyed to the printer head is similar,\" says Steve Herchen, one of Zink's original inventors and present chief technology officer. \"The advantage with Zink is that there is no need for an ink ribbon. The heat is applied directly to the paper. There are no gears, no motors, no mechanism is required to manage the ink ribbon. All the information is in the paper.\" Inkless footprint . So not only is Zink compact, it's ecological.

So who built the first model of \"Solar Impulse,\" Piccard's $72-million solar-powered craft? A company that makes ships. Piccard, who won the first transatlantic balloon race and commanded the first balloon flight around the world, told CNN, \"Each time we asked the aeronautical industry to build that airplane, they told us it's impossible. We cannot make an airplane so light and so big. So who did we ask for some help? A boat manufacturer. They had no idea it was impossible, so they built the pieces in carbon fiber and now we have an airplane.\" The plane is made by the Swiss company Decision SA, which made the America's Cup-winning Alinghi. \"People put limitations on their creativity, believing they have to rely on what they know and what they have done,\" Piccard says. He sees the Solar Impulse venture as a way to dramatically demonstrate that it's possible to make a sharp break with the past -- in this case, by showing that renewable energy can replace fossil fuel. \"A lot of industries say we have a society based on oil dependency, so let's continue. ... We know how to deal with oil. The result is General Motors and Chrysler going bankrupt. It's a typical example of people who did not make the turnaround early enough. If GM made engines with much lower fuel consumption, they would not have gone bankrupt.\" \"We have to get rid of certainties, habits, paradigms, common assumptions,\" Piccard says. \"These are the limits to creativity.\" Piccard, who is 51, spoke about his new venture at the TED Global conference in July 2009 and elaborated on it in a recent interview with CNN.com.

        "Sum the following article in brief: New York (CNN) -- New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is asking state legislators to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana that are in public view. Saying the aim was to avoid unnecessary misdemeanor charges against thousands of New Yorkers -- \"disproportionately black and Hispanic youth,\" according to a statement from the governor's office -- the legislation \"brings consistency and fairness\" to New York's marijuana laws. \"There is a blatant inconsistency. If you possess marijuana privately it is a violation, if you show it in public it's a crime. It's incongruous. It's inconsistent the way it has been enforced,\" Cuomo told reporters at a press conference in Albany on Monday. In 1977, New York's legislature reduced the penalty for possessing 25 grams or less of marijuana to a non-criminal violation carrying a fine of no more than $100 for first-time offenders -- as long as the marijuana was in private possession and not in public view. If the marijuana is out and viewable in public -- as it might be when someone is asked to empty his or her pockets during a so-called police \"stop and frisk\" -- it becomes a Class B misdemeanor. Selling and smoking or burning marijuana is still a crime, and Cuomo is not suggesting changing that. \"The statute as currently written unnecessarily subjects tens of thousands of people to criminal arrest and prosecution for very small quantities of marijuana,\" said New York State Assembly member Hakeem Jeffries. \"The overwhelming majority of people who have been arrested as a result of the way that the statute is currently written come from the black and Latino community,\" Jeffries said, adding that statistics and studies show that marijuana possession and use \"is far more racially diverse.\" According to data released by the governor's office, 2,000 arrests for small amounts of marijuana were made in 1990. In 2011, over 50,000 arrests were made. Fifty percent of those arrested were under 25 years old, and 82% were black or Latino. Less than 10% were ever convicted of a crime....",

Both Raffaele Sollecito (left) and Amanda Knox deny charges of murder and sexual assault. Amanda Knox, 21, is an American college student from Seattle, Washington, who is on trial for murder in Perugia, Italy. The case has given Knox almost pop star status there. She was voted the top woman in an online \"person of the year\" poll by an Italian TV channel in December, beating out Carla Bruni, the Italian-born French first lady. Seven of the 11 Facebook pages champion her innocence; four seem convinced that Knox is pure evil. A sampling of comments: \"No to Amanda. No to her superstardom\" ... \"She's a sociopath\" ...\"Everyone is not sure if she is guilty or not and that she will lead us to a new existential awareness. Please shout with me your anger. ... Let's say no. Let's say Knox.\" Knox and former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 24, are charged with murdering and sexually assaulting one of Knox's roommates, British exchange student Meredith Kercher, on November 1, 2007. They insist they are innocent and are disputing the allegations. Knox and Sollecito are due back in court today. The last time Knox appeared before the panel of eight judges, she wore a T-shirt quoting The Beatles: \"All you need is love.\" Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini alleges that Kercher, 21, was killed because she refused to participate in a drug-fueled sex game played by Knox, Sollecito, and a third man, Ivory Coast native Rudy Hermann Guede. In court papers, prosecutors stated that Sollecito held Kercher by her wrists while Knox poked at her with a knife and Guede sexually assaulted her. The case is being tried in Perugia, a university town about 115 miles north of Rome that is better known for its chocolate than for its scandalous murder trials. According to the prosecutor's office, Kercher had been in Italy for two months as part of a year-long course with Leeds...",

Netanyahu said that Prof. William Schabas \"was biased against Israel\" and that the commission of inquiry's as yet unpublished report was written at the behest of the U.N. Human Rights Council, which the Prime Minister described as \"an anti-Israel body.\" He said the report, due to be presented to the U.N. Human Rights Council in March, should be shelved. \"This is the same council that in 2014 made more decisions against Israel than against Iran, Syria and North Korea combined,\" he added. Netanyahu said that Israel acted in accordance with international law during Operation Protective Edge and that it was \"Hamas, the other terrorist organizations and the terrorist regimes around us that need to be investigated, not Israel.\" Israel's Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman also accused Schabas of bias -- saying his nomination was \"like appointing Cain to investigate who murdered Abel\" -- and welcomed his resignation, describing it as \"another achievement of Israeli diplomacy.\" Schabas, a Canadian-born professor of international law based in London, was appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council to head the three-person commission of inquiry in August. The council said its task was \"to investigate all violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, particularly in the occupied Gaza Strip, in the context of the military operations conducted since 13 June 2014.\" This includes looking at the activities of Palestinian armed groups in Gaza, including attacks on Israel, as well as the Israeli military operation in Gaza and the West Bank, it said.

Then on April 21, they will select 24 of the state's 52 delegates and award them to presidential candidates.

After pulling out during the final round of the Honda Classic at PGA National, Woods challenge at the WGC Cadillac Championship was blunted by spasms which started after hitting a ball from an awkward stance in fairway bunker at the par four sixth at Doral's Blue Monster course. \"That's what set it off and then it was done after that,\" Woods said following a frustrating round, PGATour.com reported. \"Just (tried to) see if I could actually manage through to keep the spasms at bay.

A third base will be shut on Sunday, said the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The state-run LANA news agency said the militias, which it identified as Bou Salim Martyrs and Ansar al-Sharia, will also disband. The move comes after hundreds marched in the nearby city of Benghazi and took over the headquarters for Ansar al-Sharia. Individuals from the radical Islamist group are accused of having been involved in the attack last week that left four Americans dead. Protesters demanded an end to all security activities of armed groups operating outside the official command of the army or police. Mohamed al-Magariaf, president of Libya's General National Congress, later told reporters that a joint security office would be established to bring together the army and the various brigades backed by the government. Militias outside that office will not be allowed to operate, he said. As militia members fled the headquarters in Benghazi, demonstrators torched a vehicle and took over the group's building without firing a single shot. Army General Naji al-Shuaibi said the citizens, whom he referred to as \"revolutionaries of the February 17 uprising,\" later asked that the Ansar al-Sharia headquarters be handed over to the Libyan army.

Set in the 1960s, the golden era of the cheongsam in Hong Kong, Wong Kar Wai's hit movie, \"In the Mood for Love\" (2000), which won multiple best foreign movie awards, was a powerful showcase for how elegant and sexy the classic Chinese dress can be. Wong has said 20 to 25 cheongsam alone were made for the character played by Maggie Cheung. \"A Century of Fashion: Hong Kong Cheongsam Story,\" now running at the Hong Kong Museum of History until March 3, features 130 exhibits showcasing the history and evolution of the cheongsam, particularly the eras featured in popular films such as \"In the Mood for Love\" and \"The World of Suzie Wong\" (1960).

The exhibition is a study in the history surrounding the iconic Chinese dress that can be confusing even to Chinese -- the proper use of \"cheongsam\" and \"qipao,\" for instance. \"We prefer to call it cheongsam -- not qipao,\" says Osmond Chan, assistant curator of the exhibition. \"Cheongsam means long robe in Cantonese and actually only became a common woman's wear after the May Fourth Movement (1919), or the New Culture Movement,\" he says. \"Women started wearing men's long robes as a feminist statement and trend during that anti-Qing era. \"Therefore, it's a bit of an oxymoron to continue calling the dress qipao, which refers to the robe of the Manchu (the ruling power of Qing Dynasty).\" Early cheongsam didn't have the tight, figure-hugging shape the dress is known for today, but was originally worn loose on the body.

Goats bleat in the distance, water buffaloes chew on hay and the cackles of crows ring through the air. Welcome to the village of Chevuru, in southeast India, not far from the Bay of Bengal. Here, lush green rice paddies ring concrete homes in various stages of construction. I came here with 15 colleagues to help these villagers, who are among some of India's poorest and most disadvantaged people. We came to help build safe and solid concrete and brick homes for them. The villagers are Dalits -- once known as untouchables -- and they still suffer from discrimination. This group of 90 families live in thatched-roof huts that are prone to leaks and have mud floors that wash away. Some of their children attend a \"school\" that is a small outdoor space in front of a church. Many only have the clothes on their backs for daily wear.

Despite their tough lives -- many of the village men can only get work a few months a year on the rice paddies -- the villagers were enthusiastic, generous and hard-working. We worked under humid skies and sunny days, sometimes in more than 40-degree Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) temperatures. We carted cement, sifted materials, mixed cement, plastered walls -- and one day we worked together as a group to plaster a roof.

More than 20 members of the woman's family stoned her to death for the \"crime\" of \"dishonoring\" her family by choosing to marry someone she loved rather than a husband her family had chosen.  A police officer said  \"one family member made a noose of rough cloth around her neck while her brothers smashed bricks into her skull.\" Social media immediately picked up on the horrific and very public killing. #Farzana became a hashtag that provoked a conversation about the crime of so-called \"honor killings\" and society's tolerance and the police's alleged indifference to it.  Suddenly a crime that not long ago would barely have elicited a headline was now a source of conversation and consternation among those on social media both within and outside Pakistan.  And discussion about the slaying turned up another grim fact: Iqbal told CNN he killed his first wife so he could be free to propose to Farzana.

Evelyn Einstein told CNN she hadn't received a dime from the marketing and sales of Einstein merchandise, while others have profited. \"I'm outraged,\" she told CNN in a February interview, adding that she was a 69-year-old cancer survivor and needed the money for health care. \"It's hard for me to believe they would treat the family the way they have, which has been abysmally.\" Her grandfather, the German-born physicist who formulated the general theory of relativity, bequeathed the literary rights for the more than 75,000 papers and other items in his estate to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem when he died in 1955. The Israeli university also owns the rights to his likeness, using a Los Angeles-based company called Greenlight LLC to handle licensing for items such as Einstein apparel, mugs, puzzles, coins, posters and other collectibles. \"What does a bobblehead have to do with a literary estate?\" asked Evelyn Einstein, who said she had been ignored by the university in her requests for an arrangement that would allow her to profit from the sales. Just recently she had begun preparations to sue the university. The school responded with a statement saying, \"Einstein left all of his intellectual property, encompassing his literary estate and personal papers, to the Hebrew University, including the...",

After all, it had assembled experts renowned in the field, including forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht and investigator Josiah \"Tink\" Thompson (\"who did the original bullet work\"). \"I'm here in Pittsburgh with 50 experts who really have done a lifetime of free work on this,\" Stone told CNN. \"It was in the paper here, but it should be front page news throughout the United States. I wish people would come here and cover this.\" Stone, along with the rest of America, is revisiting President John F.

Ever since the film's release in 1991, Stone says more evidence has been made available that reinforces his work, such as the report by the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), \"which if anything, widens some of the loopholes found by the Warren Commission,\" and makes him more certain of the scenario presented in \"JFK.\" \"There's nothing in the movie that I would go back on,\" he said. Alternatively, he dismisses works such as Gerald Posner's \"Case Closed,\" which he said was discredited. Stone: We're not all conspiracy theorists . In the film \"JFK,\" Stone tears apart the Warren Commission's report that a single shooter -- Lee Harvey Oswald -- fired three shots from the sixth floor of the nearby book depository. This is referred to as the \"magic bullet\" theory because of the time frame and trajectory required for a bullet to make the path and wounds that transpired. Instead of Oswald as a shooter acting alone, a number of direct and indirect co-conspirators at the highest levels of government are posited in \"JFK.\" They include the CIA, the FBI, the Secret Service, then-Vice President Lyndon B.

        "Sum the following article in brief: Conakry, Guinea (CNN) -- After three days of violence throughout the country that killed at least nine people, injured dozens more and pushed the ruling military junta to declare a national state of emergency, calm returned to Guinea on Thursday. Military units are now deployed around the country to \"preserve the peace, tranquility and national unity,\" said Gen.Nouhou Thiam, army chief-of-staff, on state radio. The state of emergency will last until the West African country's Supreme Court finalizes results from a November 7 runoff between longtime opposition leader Alpha Conde and former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo that put Conde on top with 52.52 percent of the vote. Since the provisional results were announced on Monday night, supporters of Diallo, largely from the Peul ethnic group, have clashed with Conde supporters and security forces. Many shops in areas effected by violence reopened Thirsday, and automobile and pedestrian traffic resumed to near-normal levels. It was a remarkable turnaround from 24 hours earlier, when military police were clashing with civilians in broad daylight throughout the capital city of Conakry. French radio RFI reported that strife-torn cities in the northern Fouta Djallon region such as Labe, Dalaba and Pita had calmed by Thursday as well. But residents of Conakry's impoverished suburbs of Cosa, Hamdallaye, Enco5 and Bambeto -- areas of majority Peul supporters of defeated candidate Diallo -- are wary of the near future. Many residents reported gunfire throughout Tuesday night as roving military units continuously fired into the air. \"The daytime is calm, the violence happens at night. Last night I heard a lot of gunshots. I could not sleep, my wife and children were sleeping under the bed to avoid stray bullets,\" said Youssouf Bah, a Hamdallaye resident. \"The military was around, opening fire. When we woke up this morning, some families complained that the military was entering houses,\" Bah added. Guinea's military has long been scrutinized for alleged human rights...",

        "Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?\n\nArticle: Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese officials' concerns over food contamination expanded beyond the country's borders Tuesday as tests detected radiation in ocean water offshore. Plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. said that high levels of radioactive substances were found in seawater near the plant, but said that the results did not represent a threat to human health. \"There should be no immediate health impact. If this situation continues for a long period of time, some impact can occur,\" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters. The impact such radiation could have on marine life was unclear. Japanese authorities were scheduled to measure radioactivity in waters around the plant on Tuesday and Wednesday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Earlier seawater radiation monitoring detected levels of iodine-131 that were 126.7 times higher than government-set standards, the electric company said on its website. Its monitors detected cesium-134, which has a half-life of about two years, about 24.8 times higher than the government standards. Cesium-137 was found to be 16.5 times higher than the standard. The electric company detected these levels in seawater 100 meters (328 feet) south of the nuclear power plant Monday afternoon. Radioactive particles disperse in the ocean, and the farther away from the shore a sample is taken, the less concentrated the contamination should be. Because of the huge amount of dilution that happens in the ocean, there's not much chance of deep-water fish being tainted, said Murray McBride, a professor at Cornell University who studies soil and water contamination. \"I think the ocean can handle that a lot better than the physical environment and population centers,\" said Jim Walsh, an international security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a CNN consultant. \"We don't want any of this to happen, but better it go out to sea than stay in Japan.\" Winds have largely blown radioactive material emitted by the plant offshore since an earthquake and tsunami...",

Richard John Evans, the state's former chief medical examiner, described gunshot wounds to the temple, neck, spinal cord or heart in graphic detail. The jury in Bulger's federal racketeering and murder trial was both riveted and visibly uneasy during Evans' testimony, with some of them holding their hands over their mouths as he outlined the damage inflicted by bullets in 17 of the 19 cases. Others twisted in their chairs during the testimony, while many intently took notes. But about eight victims into the litany of death certificates, the jurors appeared more relaxed. Most of the victims were shot repeatedly in the head or neck, Evans testified. They included William O'Brien, who was expecting a baby boy when he was shot 20 times on a Boston boulevard in 1973. \"The most significant of the 20 was a wound to his right shoulder which pierced the spinal cord and lodged in his neck region,\" Evans explained. \"It severed the spinal cord five centimeters from the bottom of the brain stem, which would make breathing impossible.\" Former drug dealers detail threats during Bulger's reign .

        "Summarise the article:\n\n(CNN) -- This weekend, Manchester United's Alex Ferguson will attempt to become the first manager in history to win three Champions League titles when his side face Barcelona at Wembley. The achievement, which would match the late Bob Paisley's European Cup feat with Liverpool in the 1970s, is not only a testimony to Ferguson's run of success since taking over at Old Trafford in 1986, but also continues the remarkable legacy that Scottish managers continue to have on football as a whole. From Ferguson to Matt Busby, Kenny Dalglish to Bill Shankly, George Graham to Jock Stein, the impact that Scottish managers have had through the years is so great that it has changed the course of history for some major football institutions. Earlier this month, Ferguson, the son of a Glasgow shipbuilder, guided United to a record 19th English league  title, with all but two of those successes coming under the guidance of either Ferguson or Busby -- whose five league titles would surely have been many more but for the 1958 Munich air crash which decimated his \"Busby Babes\" squad. Liverpool's period of dominance in English and European football began when Shankly -- who was born and raised in a tiny Ayrshire mining village -- took over in 1959, helping the club to three league titles, a feat matched by compatriot and current Anfield incumbent Dalglish. Arsenal had spent 18 years in the football wilderness before Graham, the youngest of seven children brought up by his mother after his father died when he was still a baby, took over and led the club to two titles in three seasons in 1989 and 1991. And the legendary Stein, another to be brought up in a coal mining community, led Celtic to become the first ever British winners of the European Cup in 1967, with Busby guiding United to victory the very next year. The trend for successful Scottish managers has now spanned seven decades and Jim Fleeting, the Director of Football Development at the Scottish Football Association (SFA), told CNN that he believed the continued success of...",

Sources close to the matter said the resignation, first reported by CNN, came under pressure from the White House, where officials were furious about his suggestion that the Obama administration is mistreating Manning, the Army private who is being held in solitary confinement in Quantico, Virginia, under suspicion that he leaked highly classified State Department cables to the website WikiLeaks.

Glenda Estell, 54, was arrested without incident around 10:40 a.m. at her her home in Hot Springs, Arkansas, according to the arrest report. She is set to appear in court August 13 on one charge of assisting in or furnishing an implement of escape for an inmate. Her son, Derrick, remains at large. According to Garland County Deputy Sheriff Scott Hinojosa, investigators have received tips on Estell's whereabouts in recent days \"but unfortunately, at this point, none of them have been credible.\" Surveillance video from Sunday shows Estell talking on the phone and then bolting through a 12-by-30-inch reception window at the Garland County Detention Center while another prisoner distracts deputies. He then ran out the front of the jail -- with a deputy close behind him -- then jumped into a waiting car and sped away.

The Zero DS motorcycle is part trail, part road bike and has a top speed of 55 miles per hour, which might not make it so useful in a high-speed pursuit. But what it lacks in horsepower it more than makes up for in stealth. Powered by a lithium-ion battery (which takes four hours to recharge) the bike hardly makes a sound -- thus allowing police to exercise their own right to silence before uttering a similar sentence to law-breakers. Police departments all over the world are embracing all manner of electric vehicles, recognizing their duty of care to the environment as well as to the citizens of the streets they patrol. One of the more popular electric models to hit the market in recent years is the T3, manufactured by California-based T3 Motion. The three-wheel stand-up bike has proved popular not only with police forces but also with security companies and the military. The zero emissions trike affords drivers an elevated platform giving them wide visibility and \"a commanding presence,\" say its manufacturers. Maneuverable yet sturdy, the T3 has found a home with police departments in the Middle East, North America, Europe and Asia. Another electric car that a law enforcement force might be happy to have in its fleet is BMW's Electric MINI, which has been styled by German tuning company, AC Schnitzer. Unveiled at the Essen Motor Show, Germany at the end of 2010, the design was part of a safety initiative by Germany's Federal Transport Ministry. Sadly, the car isn't available yet. Carl Archambeault imagines his \"Scarab\" concept as an eco-friendly accomplice in combating crime.

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN)Marijuana smokers now have a new place to put on their bucket lists: Alaska, which on Tuesday became the third state to officially OK marijuana use. Following Colorado's lead, voters passed the Alaska Marijuana Legalization ballot measure in November. Legalization became official on Tuesday, which means that now \"the use of marijuana (is) legal for persons 21 years of age or older.\" There are limits to this law, as there are in similar ones in other states. People still can't legally have more than 1 ounce of marijuana on them. Nor can they harvest more than 4 ounces in their home. And consuming marijuana in public and driving while high are no-nos. Then there's the fact that the law isn't fully implemented yet. The regulatory structure allowing for entrepreneurs to set up shops like those found in Colorado is still in the works, so right now no one can legally make a living selling the drug. Not to mention that, under federal law, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 narcotic. That makes its use a federal crime. Is weed legal in your state? Still, as in many states, there seems to be movement in Washington on that front. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told CNN in October he is \"cautiously optimistic\" on the subject of marijuana legalization. Holder said the Justice Department is focused on marijuana distribution to minors, interstate trafficking and drug violence, not incarcerating \"low level people who are simply there for possessory offenses.\" In the absence -- some might say in defiance -- of any sweeping federal change on marijuana, some states have taken the initiative. Twenty-three states still prohibit cannabis outright. But the rest of them have either legalized medical marijuana or decriminalized marijuana possession. Colorado became the first to go one step further in legalizing pot, followed by Washington state. And now there's one more in Alaska.",

            "JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono held a commanding lead in national elections Wednesday, according to the latest exit polls. A woman votes at a polling station in Indonesia. An average of six exit polls showed the incumbent holding about 60 percent of the vote compared to 27 percent for former President Megawati Sukarnoputri and 12 percent for Yudhoyono's vice president, Yusuf Kalla. Official results are expected no sooner than next week. Indonesia has 175 million registered voters spread over 17,000 islands. It was the country's second direct election since the authoritarian regime of dictator Suharto fell in 1998, in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. Analysts and polls, ahead of the vote, predicted Yudhoyono -- riding high on the country's economic strength -- would win a second term.  Watch as incumbent expected to win election \u00bb . In 2004, Yudhoyono defeated then-incumbent Megawati in a runoff election.  Watch more on the election \u00bb . Yudhoyono \"has positive global image; relations with the American government have been the best in all the time that I have been here, the last 30 years,\" said James Castle, who analyzes Indonesia's politics and economy. \"He's very popular in the foreign community and, to be honest, if he's not re-elected, the markets will react negatively for a month or so.\" Yudhoyono's Democratic Party was the only single party to get enough votes in April's legislative elections to nominate a candidate on its own. Kalla's Golkar Party came in second and Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, or PDI-P, placed third. Kalla and Megawati had to form coalitions with other parties to run for president. Kalla had hoped voters would give him some of the credit for Indonesia's economic successes which occurred under his term as vice president.

Kelly Rowland took an AIDS test in a tiny counseling room in a Kenyan hospital. And then she proved it doesn't take three to make hits. Sassy Kelly Rowland showed the world she could go it alone and still hit No. 1 on the charts.

She is the first ambassador for MTV's Staying Alive Foundation, which works to empower young people to protect them against AIDS.

        "Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?\n\nArticle: (CNN) -- Video of Oscar Pistorius re-enacting how he says he killed his girlfriend was illegally obtained by the Australian television network that aired it Sunday, a lawyer for the former Olympian said. The network says that isn't so. Channel Seven's \"Sunday Night\" included the video in an hourlong report on the case against Pistorius, who is on trial for murder in the February 2013 shooting death of Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius, 27, admits firing the bullets that killed Steenkamp, but he says he mistakenly thought he was defending himself from an intruder. Prosecutors say the two had an argument and he deliberately murdered the model and law school graduate, who was 29. The video shows the disabled athlete walking on the stumps of his legs -- without his prosthetics -- while pretending to aim a handgun. Pistorius is also seen with his prosthetic legs, carrying his sister down a set of stairs, which is intended to demonstrate how he says he carried Steenkamp. There was no comment in court about the video during the trial Monday. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel seemed to be trying to bait a witness into mentioning it, which could have opened the door to having it admitted in court, said CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps. But the witness, South African Paralympic team doctor Wayne Derman, did not refer to the video. After his testimony, lead defense lawyer Barry Roux indicated that he planned to close his case but wanted to consult Pistorius first.

A Turkana boy holds an empty cup in a village in northwestern Kenya. Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania and Uganda are facing mudslides, crop destruction, waterborne diseases and disrupted road networks, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Friday. Djibouti, Eritrea and Ethiopia could also be affected. The effects of flooding are expected to be exacerbated because so much greenery has disappeared in the drought. \"More than 23 million people in pastoral, agricultural and suburban communities, as well as internally displaced people and refugees in the region, are reeling from the impact of water and food shortages, pasture scarcity, conflict and insecurity,\" said John Holmes, the under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs who is coordinating emergency relief operations. \"While we cannot prevent these climatic shocks, we certainly can mitigate their disastrous effects through forward planning and the right funding from the donor community,\" he said. Uganda, hit by El Nino a decade ago, is planning to apply some of the lessons learned this time around, said Fred Opolot, a government spokesman. \"The government has allocated funds and resources to areas that will be affected,\" he said. \"Our disaster preparedness department is using press briefings, among other ways, to inform the public.\" Though the department is not very well-funded, he said, the government is working with groups such as the United Nations and international aid agencies to prepare for floods. \"It is a multifaceted effort ... we want to ensure citizens are sensitized to the dangers of El Nino and things such as bridges are in good condition.\" The rainy season begins in the Horn of Africa in mid-October and runs through the end of the year.

While our daily news zeroes in on Syria and Gaza, the fiscal cliff and Christmas sales, our friends in the war-ravaged part of the immense, mineral-rich Democratic Republic of the Congo are once again convulsed in a conflict they did not choose. A resident from Goma, in North Kivu province, who for security reasons must not be named, sent me a heartbreaking e-mail accompanied by a photo taken by The Associated Press' Jerome Delay. It shows a tiny girl leading a long line of displaced women who carry enormous loads on their backs, a look of utter desperation on her face as tears stream down her cheeks. The e-mail says, \"This girl is a future mother, barely four years old and she must walk many kilometers due to the attack on her village. She cries, but who is listening? No one takes care of her, no one to console her. Her mother can't help because she is carrying their entire household's possessions on her back. Just one attack on this column of displaced people and she will find herself alone in the jungle. We only ask for peace. It's unacceptable that we deny her the chance to grow up and become a mother one day.\" It is shocking how ill-prepared the international community has been for this latest round of violence in Africa. A leading hospital in Goma, where guerrilla forces have been poised to enter the city for months, sent desperate e-mails to friends around the world pleading for antibiotics, painkillers, plaster and bandages, as international agencies focused on evacuating their staff members from border areas. E-mails I received showed bloody, shattered limbs of children and badly wounded patients with expressions of horror and despair.

An Iraq war veteran takes one of the four medications he is prescribed for post-traumatic stress disorder. Three of five members of the military worry that it would have at least some impact, according to the small online survey conducted for the American Psychiatric Association. About half said they thought other people would think less of them if they sought help for mental health problems. The report was released a day before a scheduled announcement by Defense Secretary Robert Gates aimed at encouraging more service members to seek help for post-combat stress. Pentagon officials said troops who file for security clearances will no longer have to answer a question on the standard application about whether they have been treated for combat-related mental health issues. Currently, if service members say they have received treatment, they must answer the question in an in-depth interview with a security agent. Dr. Carolyn Robinowitz, president of the APA, called the figures in the survey \"alarming\" and urged Congress to devote more money to treating mental health problems arising from service in combat zones. One in four of the troops surveyed said he or she knew \"nothing at all about effective mental health treatments for issues that may arise from their service in a war zone,\" Robinowitz said. She said a military culture that emphasizes toughness could hinder efforts to get troops to seek help. \"The military has done a good job of having a lot of educational materials around,\" she said, but she is not sure the information \"filtered down\" to the people who need it. An Army psychiatrist admitted that it is a challenge to get people to seek help. \"Stigma is a problem. We recognize that,\" said Col.

        "Summarise the article:\n\nPARIS, France (CNN) -- The French Senate early Thursday narrowly passed a controversial law to allow many more shops across the country to open on Sundays, in what would be a significant cultural shift. The law would permit shops, department stores, and shopping malls to open on Sundays in 20 zones. The vote, which followed two days of debate, was expected to happen Friday. But the Senate put the measure to a vote at 2 a.m. Thursday (8 p.m. ET Wednesday), when it passed 165-159. The law, however, is not a fait accompli. The opposition Socialist party immediately appealed to the Constitutional Council, asking it to make sure the measure is constitutionally sound. A decision from the council is expected in about two weeks. If the Constitutional Council approved the law, it would mark a significant cultural shift in France, where Sundays have officially been set aside as a day of rest for more than a century. A 1906 law forbids Sunday trading in all but the largest cities. President Nicolas Sarkozy had pushed for the measure, but the law that passed Thursday contains fewer changes than Sarkozy had originally intended, because he has had to give in to opposition from the left and the right. Socialists filed thousands of amendments to the president's original version of the law. Leftists and unions said it would effectively introduce a seven-day workweek and allow bosses to force employees to work Sundays.  Watch how new law will change a way of life in France \u00bb . Members of the president's own ruling conservative party opposed the law despite assurances that it would boost economic activity, saying it would instead deprive families and church groups of their dedicated day. The law would permit shops, department stores and shopping malls to open on Sundays in 20 zones of what are called \"exceptional commercial\" centers in and near three of the country's largest cities: Paris, Marseilles and Lille. Those centers are malls or clusters of shopping centers often located just outside major cities. Additionally, 29...",

Chase Scott, spokesman for West Palm Beach Police, told CNN that officers were executing a search warrant for evidence in the home of Jorge and Carmen Barahona. Jorge Barahona, 53, was found unconscious beside his pest-control truck early Monday along a south Florida interstate by a road assistance ranger, along with his 10-year-old adopted son, who was inside the vehicle next to an open gas can, according to a probable-cause affidavit filed by detectives. Hours later, crews removing toxic chemicals from the truck discovered the boy's twin sister dead in a plastic bag. Earlier Thursday, Barahona was taken to a hospital Thursday after he \"attempted to harm himself,\" police said. Barahona, who was in custody in the Palm Beach County Jail, suffered a self-inflicted injury after deputies told him to get ready to go to a court hearing Thursday morning, West Palm Beach Police spokesman Scott Chase said. \"He immediately attempted to harm himself by thrusting himself backwards, causing an injury to his head,\" Chase said. \"He was immediately checked by emergency personnel and it was decided he was OK to appear in court.\" However, Barahona \"refused to cooperate\" by not speaking and the judge decided to delay the hearing until another date, Chase said. Authorities later decided to take Barahona to Wellington Regional Medical Center for observation, he said. Meanwhile, a medical examiner has determined a cause of death for the girl, but it will not be made public until investigators review the findings, Chase said Thursday.

Or, as Mraz puts it, \"I hope it has something to do with their savvy freshness.\" Mraz, who turned 32 this week and took his parents to the celebratory dinner at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square June 18, says he feels great about the honor. \"I never thought my songs would escape my bedroom,\" he said. \"To have the music shared all around the world, and to be acknowledged by communities like this ... it's inspiring.\" Mraz's 2008 album \"We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things\" has been a runaway success, with more than 2.5 million copies sold worldwide. It also led to three Grammy nominations, including song of the year and best male pop vocal performance for the reggae-inflected hit \"I'm Yours.\" Mraz (whose name reflects his family's Czech heritage) hits the festival circuit overseas before kicking off his stateside \"Gratitude Caf\u00e9 Tour\" July 25. The tour's quirky title was inspired by a wholesome San Francisco, California, restaurant Mraz loves. A fan of maintaining a diet of predominantly raw foods, Mraz is also a farmer of sorts: He owns an avocado farm in his home city of San Diego, California. He's also a juggler, a skill Mraz taught himself during the downtime that comes with touring.  Watch the multitalented Mraz perform \u00bb . Mraz shared tales of his avocado farm, as well as what it's like to get the cold shoulder from Simon Cowell, when he sat down with CNN recently. CNN: So, you live on an avocado farm.

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- Patriotism could reach fever pitch when the USA and Europe collide in golf's Ryder Cup ... and it looks like American star Rickie Fowler has let it go to his head. Pictured stepping off the plane as the U.S. team arrived at Edinburgh airport ahead of this week's match, the world No. 10 sported a new haircut with \"USA\" shaved into the side of his head. Although it might be unusual for a golfer to have such an outrageous hairstyle, displays of national pride are entirely in keeping with the Ryder Cup. Played every two years, it pits the best golfers from Europe and the USA against each other with the winner securing bragging rights in the sport's most partisan contest. Europe has dominated the competition in recent years, winning the last two contests. The U.S. team, captained by eight-time major winner Tom Watson, will be out for revenge when the 2014 competition begins at Scotland's Gleneagles course on Friday. While golf courses are usually the epitome of peace and quiet, the Ryder Cup galleries are altogether more raucous. So expect star spangled banners and roars of \"USA, USA\" to accompany Fowler around the course throughout the three days of competition. With so much adrenaline and excitement in the air, tensions have boiled over in the past. During the 1999 event at the Brookline club in Massachusetts, the USA team was criticized for celebrating a dramatic victory on the green while European player Jose Maria Olazabal was still waiting to take his putt. Expect more fierce clashes over the course of this week...",

For the 10th year running, European champion Real Madrid is the world's richest club in the annual Football Money League published by accountants Deloitte, with a revenue of $639 million. Money clearly talks in European football with the combined revenues of the top 20 clubs in the rich list rising by a staggering 14% over the last year to $7 billion. All of the top five clubs for the 2013-14 financial year saw their revenue surpass the $500-million mark for the first time on a list dominated by the English Premier League, home to five of this year's top 10 and eight of the 20-strong list. As a result of the latest Premier League broadcast rights deal, all of its teams have made it into the world's top 40 highest-earning clubs. This year is the 18th running of Deloitte's Money League, which has been dominated by Real for a decade, although Manchester United catapulted past both Barcelona ($563.5 million) and Bayern Munich ($566.8 million) to move into second place with revenues of $602.3 million, a hike in revenue of some $110 million. United has been below par on the pitch in recent times, under former manager David Moyes and his successor Louis van Gaal, but figures show an 83% growth in commercial revenue over the last three years. That said, United is expected to slide in next year's Money League having missed out on Champions League revenues in this current season. Of the clubs on the list only United's \"noisy neighbors\" Manchester City -- as Alex Ferguson once described them -- enjoyed a greater spike in year-on-year revenue, with a $114 million rise from 2012-13 to cement their place in sixth on the list. \"The growth experienced within the top 20 has been remarkable,\" said Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte. \"Commercial and broadcast revenues are now more important than ever to clubs to enable them to compete financially and put the best talent on the pitch. \"This has led to further dominance from the...",

Michael and Martha Ganey had driven their son to work because he wasn't feeling well --  for the past couple of days, simple tasks had left him short of breath and exhausted. At 577 pounds, being out of shape was normal for Bryan, so he ignored it. But as he headed toward the door of his office on June 20, 2010, the ground suddenly shifted. The Ganeys were pulling away when Martha's cell phone rang. All she heard on the other end was gasping. The couple stopped the car and sprinted back to the building, where they found their son lying in the bushes, struggling to breathe.  The ride to the hospital took only five minutes, but to Martha, it seemed like hours. Bryan didn't care how long it took -- he knew he was going to die. \"I was absolutely convinced that I was having a heart attack. I had been told by doctors before that at my size, if I ever had heart problems, they weren't going to be able to operate on me. So there was a very good chance that this was the end -- that I would get there and there wouldn't be anything they could do,\" he said. Out of control . For years, Bryan worked the night shift at a Verizon call center in Charleston, South Carolina, 20 miles from his home in Moncks Corner. He skipped breakfast, ate fast food for lunch and dinner, then picked up a pizza or some convenience store snacks on his way home. He often drank more than a gallon of soda a day. By the age of 37, he had a body mass index around 87. A BMI over 30 is considered obese. \"He was very aware that he had a problem,\" Martha said. \"It was out of control.\" June 20 was possibly the best thing that could have happened to Bryan, although it certainly didn't seem like it at the time. His \"heart attack\" was actually a pulmonary embolism, or a blood clot that had traveled to his lungs, blocking his oxygen flow.

Her pal, world No. 1 Serena Williams, along with Maria Sharapova and Ana Ivanovic, have featured in the swimsuit edition in the past and the Dane couldn't wait to join them. So much so Wozniacki approached the magazine, not vice versa. \"It's always been a dream of mine (to be in the swimsuit Issue),\" Wozniacki, a former No. 1 like Sharapova and Ivanovic, told the For The Win website Monday in New York. \"I went to the offices of Sports Illustrated quite a few months ago and threw myself out there. 'If you need a model or want one, I'm here.' \"It must have made a pretty good impression. \"Because I travel the world so much and play all over the place and spend so much time over here, the issue is a huge deal for me and my family. I think because I'm in it this year, Denmark is going crazy about it this year and that's fun to see.\" Wozniacki posted pictures of the shoot on Twitter -- and one of her other friends on the tour, Victoria Azarenka, was impressed, calling the photos \"stunning.\" The magazine hit the newsstands this week. Azarenka dumped the Dane out of the Australian Open -- this season's first grand slam -- in straight sets in the second round. While Wozniacki waits for her first grand slam title, her inclusion in the swimsuit edition is likely to do no harm to her off court profile.

The Vestas Sailrocket 2 is half boat, half plane, and hopefully it will soon to be the fastest sailing vessel on water too. \"Everything above the water is an aeroplane and everything below the water behaves just like a boat,\" says Larsen, a professional sailor who's now turned his attention to breaking the speed sailing record, describing it as his lifetime mission. To attempt the feat, Larsen and his small team of naval architects, engineers and yachtsmen and women, created the sailrocket -- a hybrid boat/plane. \"A large part of this boat is flying, it's supported by aerodynamics,\" says Larsen . \"When it's going at high speed, it's like a well-built paper airplane.\" The record is open to any craft, as long as it's using wind and water, and there is at least one person on board. Currently it is held by American kite surfer Rob Douglas, who reached 55.65 knots (103 kilometres per hour) over the required 500 meter course in 2010. The group held the record briefly three years ago, but they've come across some strong competition for the title, with wind surfers proving to be the toughest opponents. Last month the team made another record attempt in southern Africa. Walvis Bay in Namibia provides the ideal wind conditions for the sailrocket. The group spent days trying to reach 60 knots -- the speed they believe will not only get them the record, but also keep it with them. \"The boat is based on this whole new idea,\" explains Larsen. \"It's got no overturning forces.\" He says the wind and water forces are in alignment. \"It's like someone trying to push you over by pushing at the soles of your feet.\" The craft may be using the latest technology, but its concept is based on a craft that was written about nearly five decades ago. American rocket scientist Bernard Smith wrote about a sailboat in 1963 that he believed could reach 40 knots --...",

A really excited black man is called a \"thug,\" but a white criminal is called Justin Bieber. In January, Seattle Seahawks star Richard Sherman caused a media uproar because of his animated post game interview after his team won the NFC championship. Apparently to some, Sherman was too excited for their liking and they labeled this Stanford University grad a \"thug.\" Yet in the same month, Justin Bieber was arrested, accused of drag racing and driving under the influence after admitting to smoking marijuana and taking pills. Later this year, he was ordered to pay $80,900 in restitution for throwing eggs at his former neighbor's home and was placed on probation, with a requirement that he take anger management sessions and perform five days of community labor. If Sherman had done that, what do you think they would have called him? Likely answer: Prisoner number_______. 2. A cantankerous cat earns more money than me (and likely you, too.)

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has outlined where he thinks U.S. policy needs to change. Ali Larijani said Saturday that Obama should apply his campaign message of change to U.S. dealings with Iran. \"Obama must know that the change that he talks about is not simply a superficial changing of colors or tactics,\" Larijani said in comments carried by the semi-official Mehr News Agency. \"What is expected is a change in strategy, not the repetition of objections to Iran's nuclear program, which will be taking a step in the wrong direction.\" In his first post-election news conference Friday afternoon, Obama reiterated that he believes a nuclear-armed Iran would be \"unacceptable.\" He also said he would help mount an international effort to prevent it from happening. Larijani said that U.S. behavior toward Iran \"will not change so simply\" but that Obama's election showed internal conditions in the United States have shifted. He added that Iran does not mind if the United States provides other Persian Gulf countries with nuclear technology, but \"you should know that you cannot prevent the Islamic Republic [from reaching its goals in the nuclear field],\" according to the news agency. Obama cautioned Friday that it had only been a few days since the election and that he was not in office. \"Obviously, how we approach and deal with a country like Iran is not something that we should simply do in a knee-jerk fashion. I think we've got to think it through,\" Obama said. \"But I have to reiterate once again that we only have one president at a time. And I want to be very careful that we are sending the right signals to the world as a whole that I am not the president, and I won't be until January 20th.\" Larijani was speaking two days after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad congratulated Obama, the first time an Iranian leader has offered such wishes...",

The group's co-chair, Rep.

The 17-year-old ended up dead, a shooting Zimmerman argued was in self-defense. The case soon captivated the nation's attention, shining a light on matters such as race and gun laws, including when or if a person should be able to legally shoot another. Tens of thousands attended rallies demanding Zimmerman's arrest and accused him of wrongly profiling Martin as a troublemaker. Many more people were glued to their televisions during Zimmerman's second-degree murder trial. That trial ended with a not guilty verdict late on Saturday, July 13, vindicating Zimmerman's supporters, who believed his actions were understandable for a man who feared for his life.

            "(CNN) -- Does anyone really want to be Fernando Alonso's teammate at Ferrari? Okay, it won't be like it was with Michael Schumacher between 1996 and 2006 when he was the undisputed number one in the team, but whoever ends up there will be playing -- at best -- second fiddle. Perhaps that's one of the reasons why Mark Webber, who was touted as a possible Ferrari driver, has signed up to race alongside two-time Formula One champion Sebastian Vettel for another year at Red Bull. Webber led for much of the 2010 world championship only to lose out to Vettel at the season's end, but last year he was completely overshadowed: one win to the German's 11, and that came in the final grand prix when his younger teammate had a gearbox problem and let him through. This year, though, he's had the measure of Vettel -- he's 16 points ahead in second place overall after heading off Alonso and Vettel to win the British Grand Prix, and he's arguably getting on better with this year's Red Bull. Webber pips Alonso to take British Grand Prix . You'd put your money on the Australian having a better race than his 25-year-old colleague at this weekend's German Grand Prix. And that's before you look at Vettel's record in his home event, which consists of two podiums, but no win. Rewind to 2009, and this race is where Webber won his very first grand prix at the age of 32 -- though that year it was held at Nurburgring; this weekend it will be at Hockenheim, as the venues alternate. Red Bull's designer Adrian Newey admitted that Webber was absolutely gutted to miss the championship in 2010, so much so that he brought some of that negative feeling into the next season. However, the reason for his troubles last year were even more basic than that. The winning Formula for success? 2011 was the year of the exhaust-blown diffuser -- a system whereby the designers managed to get the exhausts to \"blow\" over the rear diffuser even when the driver didn't have their foot on the throttle. This created a significant amount of downforce and extra..."

Even before Pope Francis spoke his first words to the throngs in St. Peter's Square, you could look into his eyes and sense the wonder. The world was looking at him. But he was looking at something, too: at all those upturned faces. At all the eyes staring back at him. Nothing can possibly prepare a person for such a sight. In this life, there are moments, and then there are Moments. The first appearance of a new pope on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica has always been a Moment like no other. Before there was telegraphy, before there was radio, before there was television, before there was the Internet, before there was Twitter, the vision -- the solemn orchestration -- of a newly elected pope stepping onto the balcony was the most dramatic possible way of bringing huge news to the world. It somehow still is. Opinion: Francis, open up the church . \"I would like to thank you for your embrace,\" the new pope said, gazing out at all those eyes. When authors and orators have searched for ways to express the ultimate example of reverential exaltation, the periodically repeated scene in St. Peter's Square, down through the centuries, has often been the one they have turned to. Tom Wolfe, in his book \"The Right Stuff,\" about the original Mercury astronauts, wanted to describe for readers just what level of devotion the newly named astronauts had received from the American people. The seven pilots had been just that -- fighter pilots, test pilots -- before being selected for the space program. Suddenly, they were something else. People would see them and begin crying. Wolfe came up with the one ideal analogy to portray the phenomenon: . \"The boys wouldn't have minded the following. They wouldn't have minded appearing once a year on a balcony over a huge square in which half the world is assembled. They wave. The world roars its approval, its applause, and breaks into a thirty-minute storm of cheers and tears. ... A little adulation on the order of the Pope's; that's all the...",

In the letter, released just a few days before Christmas, the Al Jazeera journalist praises his supporters fighting not just for his release, but also for the freedom of the press worldwide. \"We have galvanized an incredible coalition of political, diplomatic and media figures, as well as a vast army of social media supporters to fight for that most basic of rights: the right to know,\" the former BBC correspondent wrote. Last June, an Egyptian court sentenced Greste and his colleagues Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed to seven years in prison on charges of disseminating false news and supporting a terrorist organization. The three men have steadfastly denied the charges and the Qatari-owned Al Jazeera network has said \"they were just doing their job covering and challenging all sides of the story in Egypt.\" But this week Qatar shut down an Al Jazeera-run affiliate accused by the Cairo government of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, a group now considered a terror organization by Egypt. Some experts have suggested that the move signals a cooling of tensions between Qatar and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al Sisi, who overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood and imprisoned much of its leadership last year. This may bode well for the imprisoned journalists, they say. \"We haven't won this fight yet -- we are still behind bars after all -- but we have made our cause abundantly and unequivocally clear,\" the letter reads. \"And for that reason, it really is a very good Christmas.\"",

The comments, according to a transcript published by the Kremlin, came after Putin met with the chairman of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Separatists in Ukraine's Donetsk region have scheduled a referendum for Sunday. Putin called for the delay \"in order to give this dialogue the conditions it needs to have a chance.\" He said that direct talks between Kiev authorities and representatives of the pro-Russian sympathizers in southeast Ukraine were key to settling the escalating crisis. Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk dismissed Putin's comments on the referendum as \"hot air.\" \"There is no point in dealing in hot air, especially for the President of a big country. Since Russia is asking to postpone some referendum on May 11, I think the Russian President needs to be informed that there was no referendum planned on May 11 in Ukraine to begin with. \"But if terrorists and separatists supported by Russia got an order to postpone something that doesn't exist, then this is an internal matter,\" he said. In March, voters in Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula approved a controversial referendum to secede from Ukraine and join Russia, which subsequently annexed the Crimea region.

Expectations were mixed going into the show. Would she fall flat like the Patriots' footballs or take off like a firework? She had the support of well-wishers like ex Russell Brand, who promised baffled Brits that the halftime show would be \"amazing.\" But really, we were just eager for a reprieve from the lackluster first half between the Seahawks and the Patriots. Regardless of whether you appreciated her artistry, the show delivered throughout on memorable (and meme-worthy) moments, from Perry's entrance atop a robot tiger, dressed in a suit of flames, until her exit on a star that drew comparisons to NBC's \"More You Know\" logo. Much of the credit goes to guest stars Lenny Kravitz and Missy Elliott, whom some deemed more worthy of the spotlight. First up was Kravitz, who joined in a duet of \"I Kissed A Girl.\" People were excited if not somewhat confused by the pairing. Then, Perry transitioned to a tropical landscape of dancing beach balls, palm trees and sharks for \"California Girls,\" and everyone started wondering whether we were in a \"Teenage Dream\" or on a bad acid trip. Luckily, Snoop Dogg chimed in to assure us that yes, the landscape was real, and he knows because he was there. Then, Missy Elliott arrived to help Perry get her freak on, much to everyone's delight. Some would say she stole the show. But, the real kicker was her exit on a star that drew comparisons to NBC's famous \"more you know\" star. What's the verdict? Overall, most seemed to delight in roasting Perry, and were generally pleased that the show delivered enough moments to make into memes and objects of mockery.

The tennis star has not played a competitive match since losing in the second round at Wimbledon last June due to knee problems, and he is wary of pushing himself too hard in his first appearance at the Vina del Mar Open. \"I have to take it slowly and be humble to know that things won't be as good as they were before my injury. I need to be patient,\" the 11-time grand slam champion told reporters. \"I need weeks of working on the circuit. This is my first week and I don't think the goals are the same that the ones I will have in two more months.\" Nadal is hoping to defend his French Open title yet again, aiming for an unprecedented eighth crown in Paris, but the Spaniard's 2013 preparations were ruined by a preseason illness that forced him to miss last month's Australian Open. He decided the skip the hard-court event and go straight to his favored clay surface, on which he will also play in a Brazilian tournament after Chile. \"I hope the tournament will help me to get the feeling I need to add week after week after a long period without competition ... results are the least important thing right now,\" said Nadal, who last week launched a smartphone app that teaches tennis skills. \"If my knee doesn't hurt I have no fear. I've had had more serious injuries in the past and I got stronger after them,\" he added. \"This is the injury that has sidelined me the longest so maybe it will take me a bit longer to get back my confidence, the good feeling on court, but if my knee doesn't hurt I don't see why I couldn't get back my movements and game style.\" The 26-year-old will take to the court on Tuesday for a doubles match, then start his singles campaign the following day after receiving a first-round bye as the top seed in the draw despite slipping to fifth in the world rankings.

Extra fees nestled into the fine print amid blaring advertisements. Pounding 16 digits into the telephone after you've booked the wrong flight before finally getting a human voice. A few weeks ago, Darin Kaplan, a tech-savvy 27-year-old California restaurant manager, clicked his mouse hundreds of times, surfing the vast choices offered by online travel booking Web sites like Expedia.com and Orbitz.com to plan his 28th birthday cruise to Mexico before he gave up in frustration. \"It's a cut-and-paste experience when you're booking online.

It's more comforting to hand my money to someone who has the knowledge and experience.\" Some travelers like Kaplan are finding themselves defecting from travel booking sites like Travelocity.com or airline sites like Delta.com.

            "Just in case you thought you had time to catch your breath from the culture wars, the issue of marriage for gay couples is back at the  ballot box this year. On Tuesday, North Carolinians voted 61% to 39% to ban all forms of relationship recognition for same-sex couples. That's right, this amendment doesn't just prohibit gay marriage, it prevents the existence of civil unions and domestic partnerships under North Carolina's Constitution. Shockingly, the state's Republican House speaker, Thom Tillis, who was largely responsible for putting the measure on the ballot, called the anti-gay marriage initiative a generational issue and predicted that while the initiative would probably pass, it would also be repealed within 20 years. Even for most of the GOP's old-school legislators, there is dawning understanding that opposition to freedom to marry is on the wrong side of history and damaging to the long-term, and increasingly the short-term, prospects of the GOP, especially among independent-minded younger voters. Indeed, according to Gallup, 70% of people between the ages of 18 and 34 believe that same-sex marriage should be legal. Vote means uncertainty for North Carolina's same sex couples . In November, residents of four more states -- Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington -- will voice their views on same-sex marriage at the ballot box. Voters in Minnesota will consider a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, and in Maryland and Washington, they will probably face measures to undo new laws legalizing same-sex marriage passed by state legislatures. Maine will, for the first time in history, have the chance to vote \"yes\" for a freedom to marry law. Unlike in previous years, polling shows that advocates of the freedom to marry stand a good chance to win some of these battles -- and the potential losses they would face are by much smaller margins than Americans witnessed even five years ago.

The blast killed six others and left 71 wounded, Lebanon's state news agency said. Cars were burned beyond recognition as a wall of flames and thick black smoke shot up from the blast site. Chatah's bodyguard, Mohammed Badr, was among those killed, the news agency said. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack. Chatah's last tweet, posted about an hour before his death, talked about Hezbollah, the Lebanese-based Shiite militant group with which Chatah was at odds. \"#Hezbollah is pressing hard to be granted similar powers in security & foreign policy matters that Syria exercised in Lebanon for 15 yrs,\" Chatah tweeted. That group decried the attack in a statement aired on Hezbollah TV, saying the it \"only benefits the enemies of Lebanon.\" The group called on \"all the security and judicial agencies to be on high alert to expose the perpetrators and bring them to justice.\" Chatah was known as a staunch critic of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom he accused of meddling in Lebanon's internal affairs. Hezbollah has sent fighters to help al-Assad's forces in the Syrian civil war. \"A united and  peaceful Syria ruled by Assad is simply not possible anymore. It has been like that for some time,\" Chatah wrote in his last blog post. \"The status quo ante cannot be restored.

On Sunday, the Daily Item newspaper in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, published a jailhouse interview with murder suspect Miranda Barbour in which she claimed a string of killings dating back six years -- to when she was 13. \"I would lure these people in,\" the Daily Item quoted her as saying. \"I studied them. I learned them and even became their friend. I did this to people who did bad things and didn't deserve to be here anymore.\" Barbour took credit for more than 22 but fewer than 100 killings, Daily Item reporter Francis Scarcella told CNN affiliate WNEP. Authorities haven't verified her claims, although they are investigating. Barbour and her husband, Elytte Barbour, 22, do face murder charges in the 2013 death of 42-year-old Troy LaFerrara, who police say was strangled and repeatedly stabbed by the couple before being dumped in a yard.

But why should law-abiding citizens be bombarded with the megalomaniac audio and video rantings of every Shekau recording forwarded to the press? As news organizations around the world scrambled to make amends for their belated coverage of the kidnapped school girls, Boko Haram contributed to the media frenzy by releasing a video in which Shekau boasted that he would sell the girls for the equivalent of $12 each. Since then, many of us have had to endure, from local and international media, several replays of the villain's Idi Aminesque gloating into the camera. The group's earlier video released days after the bombing of a bus park in an Abuja suburb (which took place a few hours before the abductions) featured Shekau barking bombastic statements such as: \"We are in your city but you don't know where we are\", \"(President) Jonathan, you are now too small for us. We can only deal with your grand masters like Obama, the president of America ... even they cannot do anything to us ... we are more than them,\" and \"So, because of that tiny incident that happened in Abuja, everybody is out there making an issue of it across the globe?\" These taunts and other details of the video were broadly reported by international news organizations, even at a time the world was paying little attention to the missing girls -- when Nigerians were yet to know exactly how many students had been abducted, their names, and what they and their...",

Signs such as this were still up in \"toxic zones\" around Abidjan, Ivory Coast, a year after the waste dumping.

The incident happened in August 2006. \"According to official estimates, 15 people died, 69 people were hospitalized and over 100,000 others, complaining of nausea and vomiting after inhaling fumes, sought medical treatment after the incident,\" said the report by Okechukwu Ibeanu, an unpaid investigator for the Geneva-based U.N.

On October 10, Korea-watchers pored over live televised coverage of a massive military parade in Pyongyang, held to mark the 65th anniversary of North Korea's ruling party. Just like the Soviet parades of yore, it was a chance to see what military hardware the North might be showing off. The official news agency said the parade showed \"the will and might of Songun Korea to wipe out the enemy.\" The hardware was accompanied by slogans such as \"Defeat the U.S. Military. U.S. soldiers are the Korean People's Army's enemy.\" And besides the incredible synchronized goose-stepping, there were tanks and new missiles. Analysts paid special attention to the first public appearance of a road-mobile ballistic missile with a projected range of between 3,000 and 4,000 kilometers (roughly 1,900 to 2,400 miles), though reports of its existence had circulated for several years. There was also a new version of the No-dong ballistic missile, with a tri-conic nosecone, on show. That led Aviation Weekly and others to observe design similarities to Iran's Shahab missiles, suggesting further military cooperation between the two governments. North Korea's nuclear capability and ballistic missile technology are its trump card, to make up for its aging conventional forces and as a bargaining chip in negotiations. So that's what receives the bulk of funding and expertise. But despite economic stagnation, technological limitations and international sanctions, its conventional forces can't be discounted, if only because of their size. According to South Korean analysts, the North scraped together what little foreign exchange it had to buy $65 million of weapons from China, Russia and eastern Europe between 2002 and 2008. One example: It appears to have bought Chinese-made ZM-87 anti-personnel lasers, using one to \"illuminate\" two U.S. Army Apache helicopters flying along the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone in 2003. None of the crew members was injured. China says it...",

            "(CNN) -- On a small, floating piece of ice in the Beaufort Sea, several hundred miles north of Alaska, a group of scientists are documenting what some dub an \"Arctic meltdown.\" According to climate scientists, the warming of the region is shrinking the polar ice cap at an alarming rate, reducing the permafrost layer and wreaking havoc on polar bears, arctic foxes and other indigenous wildlife in the region. What is bad for the animals, though, has been good for commerce. The recession of the sea ice and the reduction in permafrost -- combined with advances in technology -- have allowed access to oil, mineral and natural gas deposits that were previously trapped in the ice. The abundance of these valuable resources and the opportunity to exploit them has created a gold rush-like scramble in the high north, with fierce competition to determine which countries have the right to access the riches of the Arctic. This competition has brought in its wake a host of naval and military activities that the Arctic hasn't seen since the end of the Cold War. Now, one of the coldest places on Earth is heating up as nuclear submarines, Aegis-class frigates, strategic bombers and a new generation of icebreakers are resuming operations there. Just how much oil and natural gas is under the Arctic ice?  The Arctic is home to approximately 90 billion barrels of undiscovered but recoverable oil, according to a 2008 study by the U.S. Geological Survey. And preliminary estimates are that one-third of the world's natural gas may be harbored in the Arctic ice. But that's not all that's up for grabs. The Arctic also contains rich mineral deposits. Canada, which was not historically a diamond-producing nation, is now the third-largest diamond producer in the world. If the global warming trend continues as many scientists project it to, it is likely that more and more resources will be discovered as the ice melts further. Who are the countries competing for resources?  The United States, Canada, Russia, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden..."

The 80 Raiders, flying 16 bombers under the command of Jimmy Doolittle, showed the world that America would never give up. \"We had planned on waiting until there were only two of us left to open the bottle and have our final toast,\" Cole said.  \"But we don't want to wait any longer.

The ruling vacated a lower court's preliminary injunction and opened the way for Texas to sever money to clinics affiliated with Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, which has come under recent attack from anti-abortion politicians. Texas Gov. Rick Perry praised the decision issued late Tuesday by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. \"Today's ruling affirms that Texas' Women's Health Program has no obligation to fund organizations that promote abortion -- including Planned Parenthood,\" Perry said. \"The 5th Circuit's decision is a win for Texas women, our rule of law and our state's priority to protect life.\" Who calls the shots on abortion laws? The Texas Women's Health Program provides about 130,000 low-income women with family planning exams, related health screenings and contraception. Texas opposed government funding for Planned Parenthood clinics because the organization provides abortions and has been in a long-running battle with the federal government. The state said in March that it was willing to give up funding from Washington and run the Women's Health Program itself. It then adopted a rule that required clinics funded by the program to certify they do not perform abortions or are not affiliates of entities that perform abortions. In a letter to Texas officials in March, Medicaid Director Cindy Mann said the state's decision was regrettable. It would, she said, \"prevent women enrolled in the program from receiving services from the trusted health care providers they have chosen and relied on for their care.\" Planned Parenthood sued Texas, winning an injunction against the law by arguing that abortion is constitutional and Texas' efforts would block women's access to preventive health care. President Barack Obama denounced the state's efforts during a...",

Since the early days of the republic, candidates attacked with a vigor that contemporary strategists would admire. In the 1800 presidential election, for example, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams criticized one another with a stunning ferocity on everything from foreign and domestic policy to private character and personal behavior. Later campaigns weren't much better. Critics of Andrew Jackson in 1836 accused him of murdering Indians. In 1884, Grover Cleveland was ridiculed for fathering an illegitimate child. William Jennings Bryan was characterized as a dangerous radical in 1896 who would ruin the economy. Despite these historical precedents, the 2008 campaign has reached all-time lows in the use of misleading and inaccurate political appeals. Even Karl Rove, the architect of negative ads in previous campaigns, has complained about the tenor of this year's campaign. John McCain broadcast an ad taking Barack Obama's words out of context and suggesting Democrats were trying to compare GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin to a pig. The McCain campaign ran another spot erroneously claiming Obama favored comprehensive sex education for kindergarteners. Democrats have not been above reproach either. After McCain secured the GOP nomination this spring, outside groups falsely claimed the Republican supported a 1,000-year war in Iraq and therefore was not worthy of the presidency. These misleading appeals suggest voters must remain vigilant about candidate, party, and group claims. Generally, the most misleading commercials have come from independent groups uncoordinated with the candidates. These organizations feel free to run emotional and inaccurate content designed to play on voter's fears and anxieties. Some of the worst ads in recent memory, such as the Willie Horton ad in 1988, have been broadcast by these kinds of groups. In past years, the only upside of attack ads was that they generally contained more issue content than other types of...",

The justices made their announcement in a brief order issued Monday. Oral arguments are likely to be held in late February or March, with a ruling by June, assuring the blockbuster issue will become a hot-button political debate in a presidential election year. The high court agreed to hear two major questions: whether the law's key provision is unconstitutional, and if so, whether the entire law, with its 450 sections, must be scrapped. Five and a half hours of oral arguments have been scheduled. Other related cases are pending and may also be added to the docket. The largest and broadest legal challenge to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act comes from a joint filing by 26 states, led by Florida. It was that series of appeals the high court accepted for review. At issue is whether the \"individual mandate\" section -- requiring nearly all Americans to buy health insurance by 2014 or face financial penalties -- is an improper exercise of federal authority. The states also say that if that linchpin provision is unconstitutional, the entire law must be also go. Joining Florida in the challenge are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

There's just one problem with that, says the Pew Research Center. Opinions expressed in the rapid-fire Twitter echo chamber, particularly in response to political news, are often at odds with the general public's. The differences? Sometimes Twitter is more liberal. At other times, it's more conservative. And it's very nearly always more negative. \"Overall, the reaction to political events on Twitter reflects a combination of the unique profile of active Twitter users and the extent to which events engage different communities and draw the comments of active users,\" the report reads. \"While this provides an interesting look into how communities of interest respond to different circumstances, it does not reliably correlate with the overall reaction of adults nationwide.\" In the yearlong study, Pew focused on political events such as the result of the 2012 presidential election, the first presidential debate between President Barack Obama and challenger Mitt Romney and several speeches given by Obama. Some examples: When Obama won re-election, public opinion polls suggested 52% of the public was pleased and 45% unhappy. On Twitter, a full 77% of tweets about his win were positive and only 23% negative. Similarly, only 20% of the public told pollsters they thought Obama did a better job than Romney in their first debate (the one in which Obama was criticized for looking tired and unfocused). But 59% of tweets favored him. Part of that might be explained by looking at who uses Twitter. Pew's research shows that Twitter users are considerably younger than the general public and more likely to lean Democratic. In a 2012 survey, half of adults who said they posted news on Twitter were younger than 30, compared with 23% of all adults. And 57% of those who posted news on Twitter were either Democrats or leaned Democratic, compared with 46% of the general public. But Twitter...",

Texas-based Heritage Auctions conducted the internet auction, which concluded Thursday night with a winning bid from Doug Walton, whose family owns seven stores in the Southeast specializing in sports cards and collectibles. \"I have been in the market for this card for a long time,\" Walton told CNN. \"It is the Mona Lisa of baseball cards.\" Walton paid $262,900, Heritage said, with $220,000 of that going to the School Sisters of Notre Dame. The card's price beat initial estimates by $162,900. Both the card and the account of how it came to be sold make for compelling stories. Like other stars of the early 20th century, Wagner, a Hall of Famer with the Pittsburgh Pirates, appeared on tobacco company cards. The T206 cards were made between 1909 and 1911. Wagner's likeness was removed, either because he opposed being associated by young fans with tobacco or because he wasn't being paid enough by the company, said Chris Ivy, director of sports sales for Heritage Auctions. Only 50 to 60 T206 Wagner cards are believed to exist. One in near-mint condition sold for $2.8 million in 2007. The Catholic order, which has a facility in Baltimore, Maryland, obtained the card when the brother of one its nuns died earlier this year, leaving several baseball cards to the congregation. Neither of the siblings has been identified. Never mind that the card's sides had been trimmed to fit in a scrapbook, that it was laminated and lost some paper on the back, leaving it in poor condition. It's an authentic T206 Honus Wagner card. \"The fact that this was in her brother's collection since the 1930s and no one knew it\" makes its history special, Ivy told CNN. The Catholic missionary and teaching order said Wagner's name \"is blessed to us now.\" \"We're very grateful to have the extra funds to help the School Sisters of Notre Dame where we minister...",

        "Could you please generate a TLDR (Too Long Didn't Read) summary of the following news article?\n\nArticle: Boston (CNN)Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told a judge Thursday he was satisfied with his defense lawyers at what is expected to be the final public hearing before his death penalty trial begins on January 5. Wearing gray slacks a white button-down shirt under a black sweater, Tsarnaev said, \"Yes, sir,\" to a series of questions from the judge, including whether he was pleased with his defense and had been kept informed about his case. It was the first time Tsarnaev -- suspected with his older brother Tamerlan of planting two bombs that killed three people and injured more than 260 others near the Boston Marathon finish line in April 2013 -- appeared in a Boston federal court since he pleaded not guilty last year. One of the more colorful developments happened as the 25-minute hearing ended. Elena Teyer -- mother-in-law of Ibragim Todashev, a Tamerlan Tsarnaev associate whom an FBI agent shot and killed in Florida last year during what authorities say was a separate murder investigation -- was in attendance and shouted in support of Dzhokhar as he was led away in handcuffs. \"I said in court, 'Dzhokhar, you have a lot of supporters. We pray for you. ... We know you're innocent,' \" Teyer told reporters afterward. Todashev, like the Tsarnaev family, was from Chechnya -- though the Tsarnaev brothers were born in Kyrgyzstan. Also at Thursday's hearing, a potential defense expert witness who has been interviewing Tsarnaev's relatives was a center of contention between the prosecution and the defense. The prosecution says it doesn't want the witness to offer an opinion on whether Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was under his older brother's control. Dzhokhar was 19 at the time of the bombings; Tamerlan, who was killed in a police encounter days after the incident, was 26. The defense, in a status hearing in April, called the Tsarnaev family dynamic key to their case. The judge did not immediately rule on the witness. Possibly another trial delay? Tsarnaev attorney David Bruck said his team could file yet...",

That, in a word, was the response in many quarters to Apple's rollout of two new iPhones on Tuesday. With the iPhone 5S, the industry's leading smartphone got a quicker processor, better camera and new fingerprint security scanner. With the iPhone 5C, it got less expensive and more colorful. And yet, from the Internet to Wall Street, Apple got savaged mercilessly. \"Much-hyped iPhone announcements from the tech giant did little to stop (Apple's) year-long descent into stagnation,\" wrote Marcus Wohlsen in Wired, a CNN.com content partner. \"Though the faster, sleeker, more powerful phone is unarguably cool, the steps forward are still incremental. And incremental isn't what the world expects from Apple.\" Even The Onion, whose spot-on satire can sometimes be a brutal contact sport, mocked Apple CEO Tim Cook's presentation with a story headlined, \"Apple Unveils Panicked Man With No Ideas.\" \"The white, ultrathin man, who exhibited such features as artificial excitement, a fully quavering voice, and what appeared to be a near total lack of inspiration, was put on full display for thousands of shareholders, industry insiders, reporters, and fans today in what Apple hopes will be a game-changer for the multinational corporation,\" read the article. Add to that a chorus of tongue-clucking from an oft-skeptical tech blogosphere, the short-form snark of Twitter, sideswipes from competitors and jitters on Wall Street, and you're a long way away from the fantastical \"reality distortion field\" that Steve Jobs famously conjured whenever he pitched a new idea or product to an adoring world. But is all this criticism fair? Harder to make a splash . To some, Apple is a victim of its own success.

This has severe repercussions.\" Abu Mazen is another name for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Netanyahu said he asked  Abbas \"to do everything to help bring them back in peace.\"  He's also given security forces orders to locate the teenagers and prevent them from being moved to Gaza or any other place. One of three boys is a dual Israeli-American citizen, according to CNN affiliate Channel 10 Israel, which attributed the information to a source at Netanyahu's office.  Israeli and U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the report. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Sunday for the immediate release of the boys. \"We are still seeking details on the parties responsible for this despicable terrorist act, although many indications point to Hamas' involvement,\" Kerry said in a written statement that offered support to the Israeli government. \"As we gather this information, we reiterate our position that Hamas is a terrorist organization known for its attacks on innocent civilians and which has used kidnapping in the past.\" Netanyahu: Israeli forces can use 'all measures' to free teens .

            "(CNN) -- More than 150 students at the University of California at Berkeley took over a campus building Thursday to protest a proposed 81% increase in tuition fees, university officials said. UC-Berkeley spokeswoman Callie Maidhof described the scene as \"an open occupation with people coming and going\" at Tolman Hall on the campus that has been known for decades as a hotbed of student activism and protests. The tuition increase proposed by the board of regents would be phased in over a four-year period. Maidhof added that when the protest began Thursday afternoon, campus police initially resisted the demonstrators and used pepper spray at one point. The university maintained a hands-off approach after that, but according to Maidhof the situation could change at the building's scheduled closing time of 9 p.m. (midnight ET). As evening fell, there were between 60 and 70 students occupying one of the classrooms and another group was participating in a teach-in outside on the lawn. Helicopter aerials of the scene from CNN affiliate KTVU showed a few protest banners hung from windows of the classroom building."

            "One cannot choose to not be a pedophile, but one can choose to not be a child molester. As details of the accusations of sexual abuse emerged from the Jerry Sandusky trial, and as the public looks on with horror, a central element to the case that has received scant attention is pedophilia itself. \"Pedophilia\" was long used as a synonym for \"child molestation,\" and both were often seen as psychological failures of self-control. Child molesters were thought to be acting out their own histories of abuses, reacting to fears of adult relationships, or manifesting a symptom that might be resolved in psychotherapy, after which they would no longer be pedophilic. Recently, however, a number of studies have starting changing that view. It appears that one can be born with a brain predisposed to experience sexual arousal in response to children. Pedophilic men have significantly less white matter, which is the connective tissue that is responsible for communication between different regions in the brain. Pedophiles perform more poorly on various tests of brain function, tend to be shorter in height and are three times more likely to be left-handed or ambidextrous (characteristics that are observable before birth). Although nonbiological features may yet turn up to be relevant, it is difficult, if not impossible, to explain the research findings without there being a strong role of biology. No one has been able to find a way to change pedophiles into nonpedophiles. But that does not mean we cannot prevent child molestation. Sexual preference for children doesn't have to result in actual sexual behaviors toward children. Cases of child molestation that involve long strings of victims over the course of years illustrate what can happen when someone gives in to, or outright indulges, his sexual interests, regardless of its potential damage on others. It is those cases that dominate headlines and provoke revulsion toward pedophiles. But they are rare. An untold number of cases merit sympathy. The science suggests that they..."

Cyd Mizell had been working on projects designed to help women and families generate income. Meanwhile, two Polish soldiers in the NATO-led force in Afghanistan were killed and one was injured by a roadside bomb, a military said Wednesday. Armed gunmen snatched Cyd Mizell and her driver, Muhammad Hadi, from a residential neighborhood in the southern Kandahar province on January 26. In a statement on its Web site, Mizell's organization -- the Asian Rural Life Foundation -- said it was \"deeply grieved to report the apparent deaths.\" \"Although we have no confirmation of their deaths, we have received information over the past few days indicating that our two aid workers have been killed,\" the statement said. The statement did not say what led the organization to believe that its employees had died. The Kandahar provincial authorities told CNN they could not confirm the report. A spokesman for the Afghanistan Interior Ministry said officials were investigating. \"We are trying to make sure whether it is true or not,\" said Zemarai Bashary. \"We cannot confirm the death yet because our police do not have any reports regarding that she was killed.\" CNN was not able to reach foundation Director Jeff Palmer early Wednesday.

The election will proceed to a runoff on June 14 between former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah and former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani, the two candidates who received the highest number of votes. In the first-round, in which around 7 millions Afghans voted on April 5, Abdullah secured 45% of the vote, while Ghani got 31.6%. A candidate needs to receive more than 50% of the votes to win the first round and avoid a runoff. Preliminary results had been announced in late April, but had to be finalized after investigations into fraud complaints. The final results from the runoff will be announced on July 22, the election commission said. It's the third election since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, and is set to be the first democratic transfer of power in the fragile, war-torn country. Abdullah was a vocal critic of the Taliban during their years in power, and although he was once an ally of incumbent President Hamid Karzai, serving in his government as foreign minister, he has in later years become an opponent. He challenged Karzai in the 2009 election but dropped out after the first round to protest what he said was large-scale voting fraud. Ghani is a former academic and U.S. citizen who gave up his passport to run for the Afghan presidency in 2009. He worked as an adviser to Karzai and also as finance minister in his Cabinet. CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.",

            "(CNN) -- The massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School has prompted the Obama administration to consider new gun laws, like banning high-capacity magazines. Up until now, this -- along with other policy changes -- has in part been hindered by the National Rifle Association, which has fought to keep gun laws lax despite the fact that most of the American public support reasonable gun legislation. While this time might be different, there are reasons to suspect this tragedy could end like the others -- with nothing changed. However, if gun control proponents were clever they could use new insights from behavioral economics to get the best of the NRA. The core reason the NRA seems to have a stranglehold on American politics is known in economics and political science as the \"collective action problem.\" A majority of the public supports common-sense restrictions on firearms. But because the numerous gun control supporters do not care as deeply as the much smaller share of gun control opponents, they are far less mobilized. One of us has seen firsthand what it's like to go around testifying at legislative bodies about gun policy. Over the years, the stands are filled with gun control opponents. Gun control supporters are largely absent. Highly visible tragedies periodically inspire what former President Richard Nixon would call the \"silent majority\" to act. The problem is that action is difficult to sustain over the long run by a large number of people who also care about other things as well. Just look at the Million Mom March. On Mother's Day in 2000, an estimated 750,000 people marched on the National Mall in Washington to call for tougher gun laws. The rally was in reaction to the tragic shootings at the Los Angeles Jewish Community Center and Columbine High School, which both occurred the year before. The grass-roots reaction was supposed to usher in an era of common sense policies to curb gun violence. But then people got busy and distracted, and things fizzled.

In addition to the 36 killed, more than 30 people were injured in the stampede, according to Mathur. Earlier, 10 people were reported dead. An estimated 40 million people came to Allahabad, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, on Sunday to bathe at the confluence of the Yamuna and Ganges rivers and the mythical Saraswati River. It's the most significant Hindu pilgrimage, occurring every 12 years, Indian cultural and political observer K. G.

Two of the dead were Iranians, the interior official said. Najaf, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of Baghdad, is frequented by Shiite pilgrims from Iran. Iraqis will go to the polls Sunday to choose a 325-member parliament. The election has been marred by violence despite heavy security. It is Iraq's fifth nationwide vote since 2003, but only the second for a full four-year-term parliament. Three attacks happened Thursday during early voting for those who will be unable to cast ballots Sunday, such as military and security personnel, detainees, hospital staff, and patients. A total of 12 people were killed and dozens were wounded. There have been warnings of further insurgent attacks around the vote. These are Iraq's first national elections since 2005, when the Sunni Arab population boycotted the elections and the political process. A Shiite-led government emerged and the Sunnis, feeling disenfranchised, went on to form the main part of the insurgency. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq calls the elections an \"important milestone in Iraq's democratic progress,\" serving to strengthen the country's sovereignty and independence as the United States draws down its military presence there.

Douglas McAuthur McCain, 33, died in a battle between rival extremist groups in the suburbs of Aleppo, Syria's once-bustling commercial capital and largest city, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group that monitors the conflict. The man's uncle, Ken McCain, said that his nephew had gone to fight as a jihadi and that the U.S. State Department told the family Monday about the death. Like U.S. officials, the group characterized McCain as an ISIS fighter and said he was killed battling al-Nusra Front, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government has blacklisted as a foreign terror organization. McCain was not the first American to fight alongside militants in Syria. Attorney General Eric Holder estimated this summer that there are 7,000 foreign fighters in the war-ravaged Middle Eastern nation. More than 100 Americans are among those who have tried to join various militant groups in Syria, U.S. officials say.  While some are aligned with ISIS, the fighters shift allegiance and it's difficult to pin down a specific number, officials say. U.S.: Jihadi in suicide bombing video grew up in Florida . Nor was McCain the first of these American militants to die in Syria. Islamists touted the role of a 22-year-old man -- identified by State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki as Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, who grew up and went to school in Florida -- in a northern Syria suicide bombing conducted in coordination with al-Nusra Front. Yet McCain's death takes on added significance, perhaps urgency, given that he's believed to be the first American killed while fighting with ISIS. Until now, Washington largely has limited its involvement in Syria to diplomatic efforts and supporting \"moderate opposition,\" as described by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey and others, that is fighting...",

A police computer image of some of the facial injuries suffered by baby Peter. The child's -- originally known as Baby P --horrifying death caused a furor in Britain, with the media, public and politicians united in demanding to know how his terrible injuries were missed by social workers, police and medical staff. Judge Stephen Kramer also Friday jailed the 27-year-old mum's boyfriend for life with a minimum of 12 years and their lodger, Jason Owen, 37, indefinitely but with a minimum of three years, the British Press Association reported. The boyfriend, 32, was also convicted of raping a two-year-old girl. Baby P's mum has to serve a minimum of five years. She and her boyfriend cannot be named. Baby P -- he could not be known by his first name, Peter, until the recent lifting of a court order -- was only 17 months old when he was found dead in his blood-spattered cot in August 2007. He had more than 50 injuries, including a broken back and fractured ribs, despite being on London's Haringey council's at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, doctors and police over eight months. The resulting public outrage saw the government's child secretary, Ed Balls, step in to demand the removal of the council's head of children's services, Sharon Shoesmith, with two other leading officials also stepping down. Shoesmith had to be placed under police guard after death threats were made.

        "Summarise the article:\n\nNew Delhi (CNN) -- A senior official from India's governing Congress party suffered brutal treatment at the hands of Maoist insurgents during an audacious and deadly attack on a political motorcade over the weekend, police said Monday. The assault Saturday by hundreds guerrillas on the convoy of Congress politicians in a forested area of the eastern state of Chhattisgarh killed at least 24 people and wounded 33, according to authorities. Among the dead was Mahendra Karma, a top local party leader and the founder of a controversial anti-Maoist militia named Salwa Judam, or the Purification Hunt. His stance against the insurgents appears to have prompted them to take a vicious approach when they captured him. They fired 30 to 40 bullets into Karma's body and smashed his head with the butt of their guns after killing him, said Ram Niwas, the state police chief. \"He was beaten brutally even after his death,\" he said. Niwas said as many as 500 insurgents had participated in the attack. Police had previously estimated that around 200 attackers had raided the convoy. At least 16 cars in the motorcade of local Congress leaders were passing through the area when the insurgents set off a land mine and opened fire on them, police said. Among the dead were eight policemen, three laborers and some car drivers. Searching for suspects . Authorities haven't reported any arrests so far, but investigations are under way. Security forces are combing the area where the raid took place, Niwas said Monday. A judicial inquiry has been ordered into Saturday's assault. If any failings on the part of the police are found, \"appropriate action will be taken,\" Niwas said when asked about his response to criticism of security in the area. On Sunday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited a hospital in Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh, where some of those wounded in the attack were being treated. He was accompanied by the Congress party chief, Sonia Gandhi. \"We will pursue the perpetrators of this crime with urgency, and I can...",

Everything that made \"The Hangover\" such an unexpected hit -- its bold, brilliant pick-up-the-pieces story structure; the way it reveled in exposing the wild side of its outwardly conventional (if mismatched) buddies; and the big dose of strange that was Zack Galifianakis in his breakthrough movie role -- has been squandered and cheapened in two uninspired, largely mirthless and meretricious sequels. So much for hair of the dog. At least this time Todd Phillips and co-writer Craig Mazin have come up with some new beats in \"The Hangover Part III,\" instead of presenting a carbon copy of the first film. (Original writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore are long gone, of course.) If you're looking for plot, they've got one. It's lazy, but at least it's straightforward. Phil, Stu and Doug (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Justin Bartha) are escorting their emotionally volatile buddy Alan (Zack Galifianakis) to a rehab clinic when they're forced off the road. Crime boss Marshall (John Goodman) explains -- at length -- how their old sparring partner Chow (Ken Jeong) has escaped from a Bangkok prison. Marshall means to hold Doug captive until the Wolfpack produces Chow and the gold bullion he stole. The hunt for Chow takes them to Mexico, for no very good reason, then back to Nevada, for closure (we hope). If Goodman seems subdued after his big, boisterous turns in \"Argo\" and \"Flight,\" it could be because the writing is so hack -- or maybe he figured there was just no way anyone was going further over the top than Ken Jeong, whose angry cokehead /rabid degenerate shtick is way beyond funny. His seething hatred for man and beast (\"Make sure you kill the guard dogs,\" he insists at one point) is so venomous it smacks of some kind of warped integrity. Not that Phillips and company are aiming for warm and fuzzy here. The movie begins (you probably saw a PG version in the trailer) with a giraffe coming to a sticky end on a highway overpass.

Plaintiffs narrowly approved the deal after facing a Tuesday night deadline that required 95 percent of some 10,000 people who worked at ground zero to approve the measure, according to Marc Berns, an attorney for the plaintiffs. In March, U.S. District Court Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected an earlier settlement, saying that it did not do enough to address the workers' ailments. Friday's agreement concludes a seven-year fight between the city and first responders, who have said they were not properly outfitted for rescue and cleanup efforts after the 9/11 attacks, leaving them exposed to toxic dust that later prompted respiratory health issues. The deal paves the way for at least $625 million in city payouts. \"It's a fantastic deal for everybody,\" Berns said. \"Is it perfect? No. Is there a perfect deal? No. But this is as good a deal as you're going to get.\" Former New York City Police Department Detective John Walcott, who has leukemia, was less enthusiastic. \"There's too much risk and no guarantees,\" and he rejected the settlement because he did not trust how the funds were going to be allocated, he said. Kenny Specht, a former firefighter suffering from thyroid cancer, said he signed on to the settlement to avoid continued litigation. \"I supported the settlement because it was the only game in town,\" he said. \"What you're being offered is not everything you deserve, but your case won't get dismissed.\" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the deal \"a fair and just resolution of these claims, protecting those who came to the aid of this city when we needed it most.\" \"We will continue our commitment to treatment and monitoring of those who were present at ground zero,\" Bloomberg said on Friday.

President Bush gives his farewell address to the nation on Thursday at the White House. Sixty-eight percent of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Sunday said that Bush's eight years in the White House were a failure, with 44 percent saying this was because of his personal shortcomings and 22 percent blaming the failure on circumstances beyond his control. Thirty-one percent said they consider Bush's presidency a success. Half of those polled say the United States could be better off today if Al Gore had been elected president in 2000 rather than Bush, with 27 percent saying the country would be worse off if Gore had won. Twenty-two percent say things would be about the same. \"Due to the Florida recount, Bush had the misfortune of coming into office under controversial circumstances,\" CNN polling director Keating Holland said. \"A lot of Americans apparently remember those circumstances and now wish things had gone a little differently.\" Only 3 percent of those questioned say Bush was one of the greatest presidents in the nation's history.

Arriving officers discovered three men dead. A woman and another man who were found injured with stab wounds later died at the hospital, according to Hanson. \"The scene was horrific\" he said. Matthew de Grood, a fellow university student, was charged with five counts of first-degree murder Tuesday afternoon. Hanson said de Grood \"obtained a large knife\" at the house and began attacking his victims shortly after he arrived. \"He targeted the victims one by one, stabbing them several times\" said Hanson. There was no known altercation between de Grood -- who was an invited guest -- and any of his victims leading up to the attack, Hanson said. He does not know why they were targeted. The victims, who have not been named, ranged in age from 22 to 27. \"These were all good kids\" said Hanson. \"They did nothing wrong.\" De Grood, 22, is the son of a longtime Calgary police officer. \"(The suspect's parents) are absolutely devastated\" said Hanson. \"They feel so much pain for the families impacted by their son. They are heartbroken.\" Hanson said the suspect had had no previous run-ins with police. \"This is a very shocking and tragic day for our students and our entire university family,\" said university President Elizabeth Cannon. \"Our thoughts and condolences go out to the families of those who have lost their loved ones in this unimaginable and senseless tragedy.\" A Calgary police statement says the identities of the victims will be released pending the completion of the autopsies, which is expected Wednesday.

I took a sip and set down my small glass of Tsingtao beer as my new friends downed theirs and refilled. Our seafood dinner, perched on the single cluttered table of a tiny antique shop, was punctuated regularly by such moments. A worker operates the giant fermentation units at the Qingdao Brewery plant in Qingdao. I joined in happily, although somewhat bemused, at each increasingly beery celebration of our host, the worldly Captain Jau. My company, a gathering from four regions of China, was engaging me in Chinese drinking etiquette, in the city of Qingdao. A few drinks in the People's Republic of China led me to discover European delights and other unexpected finds in this modest city. You'd be forgiven for not knowing where Qingdao (pronounced Chingdao) is. The Chinese city in Shandong province doesn't roll off the tongue as easily as Beijing, Shanghai, or even Xi'an. The 2008 Olympics gave it a place on the map as China's sailing hub; no longer a secret that holiday-making officials could keep for themselves.

It boasts great infrastructure, a charming climate, alfresco eateries, good coffee, sandy beaches, German history, international hotels, a brand new airport and even a famous brewery. Qingdao could pass itself off as a miniature Seattle if it weren't for the fact that pretty much no one outside of the five-star hotels speaks English, and that communism still articulates itself through the tourist beaches, stoically named Number One to Number Six. \"In mainland China, Qingdao's history is uniquely international; in...",

Piracy suspects raise their hands in surrender as an Indian navy boat approaches. In addition to the 12 Somali and 11 Yemeni suspects, the Indian navy seized two small boats and \"a substantial cache of arms and equipment,\" the military said in a statement. Among the seized items were seven AK-47 automatic rifles, three other automatic weapons and 13 loaded magazines; a rocket-propelled grenade launcher along with rockets, cartridges and grenades; up to three outboard motors and a global positioning system receiver. Pirate attacks in the waters off Somalia have increased this year, with armed men staging increasingly bold attacks on ever-larger targets. This year, pirates have attacked nearly 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and hijacked nearly 40, the International Maritime Bureau said.  Map: See where incidents have been reported \u00bb .

The North Korean regime is built on fear: fear, according to reports of defectors, that disloyalty and even minor infractions against the Kim family's cult of personality will lead to a death sentence working in one of the North's gulags, mining uranium on starvation rations while your family struggles to survive just outside the wire. There is fear that the secret police will shut off the electricity to your house and burst in to extract the DVDs or VCRs you were secretly watching to learn about the outside world; fear that border guards will not accept your bribe or might catch you bringing a Bible back from China, the punishment for which is being bound by wires poked through the ears of other prisoners and marched off to slave labor; fear that you are in a province suspected of disloyalty by Pyongyang and that you might be allowed to slip from malnourishment to starvation when the harvest comes up short again. It has been surprisingly difficult to confront North Korea on these human rights abuses. The regime claims that all of its citizens live in a worker's paradise and that Western or South Korean criticism is only aimed at confrontation and war, which Pyongyang will meet with fire and destruction. American, Japanese and South Korean governments have all at one time or another decided that pressure on human rights might distract from diplomatic negotiations over the more dangerous threat from the North's nuclear weapons program --which is, of course, one of the reasons the North wants nuclear weapons.

New Children's Laureate Malorie Blackman plans to use her two-year tenure to 'bang the drum' for diversity . Parents can be put off buying a book if it has a black character on the front cover, the new Children's Laureate has said. Malorie Blackman, the 51-year-old author of dozens of books including the award-winning Noughts & Crosses series for teenagers, has said there was still a need for 'more ethnically diverse literature in this country'. The author, from London, has said she will use her two-year tenure to 'bang the drum' for diversity. She said there was a lack of black and Asian children in picture books and described feeling 'totally invisible' when she was younger due to never reading a book that featured a black child, The Telegraph has reported. She said: 'Children will go with any story as long as it's good but white adults sometimes think that if a black child's on the cover it is perhaps not for them. 'Books teach children to see the world through the eyes of others and empathise with others. It's about the story.' She said there was still a need for 'more ethnically diverse literature in this country'. She also told the paper she wanted to spend her time as laureate focusing on older children and teenagers. The mother-of-one, who worked as a computer programmer before becoming a full-time writer 23 years ago, said she will use her position to be an 'advocate' for public libraries and campaign against 'short-sighted' closures. She said she owed her success to her local libraries when she was growing up in Lewisham, south-east London. She said: 'Each laureate can bring their own passions to it, but one of my passions is the public library service and I wouldn't have become an author and I certainly wouldn't have been standing here now as the Children's Laureate if it had not been for my local library service so that's definitely something I want to be an advocate for and cherishing our libraries and...",

The Welshman made sure of his first win in 255 attempts with a closing six-under par round of 66 at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland -- the first time the event has taken place north of the border since 1953. \"I guess it takes some people longer than others, and it's taken me a lot longer than I thought to win,\" Donaldson said. \"The first three years went too quickly and then I was out for a year with injury, so I didn't find my feet too soon after that, and then I lost my way a bit. But over the last two to three years I feel as though I have been building to this win and it's just so nice to be finally holding this trophy,\" he added. The 36-year-old started his final round trailing Sweden's Mikael Lundberg who set off at a blistering pace going out in 29 strokes. But Donaldson immediately set about reclaiming his overnight lead, bagging three birdies in the opening four holes to set the tone for the rest of an assured final round. A bogey four at the par three 11th hole was followed by birdies at the 12th, 14th and 15th holes.

        "Extract key points from the article based on which the stock market could react:\n\nLONDON, England -- A new tool that allows doctors to use laser surgery in complex operations has been hailed as a breakthrough in minimally invasive laser technology. This fiber optic tool is made from the perfect mirror, making it possible to reflect CO2 lasers for the first time. Originally designed as a military tool for the United States Department of Defense (DOD), the fiber-optic invention is revolutionizing the ways surgeons carry out brain surgeries. The \"Omni directional dielectric mirror\" was created by Professor Yoel Fink, a then-29-year-old student in Material Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1995. \"I was asked to participate in a project funded by the DOD to create the perfect mirror,\" Fink told CNN. \"The perfect mirror reflects light from all angles and does not absorb any of it. It could have been used, for example, to reflect back enemy laser beams,\" he continued . DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a subsection of the DOD, specialize in technologies they believe are about 25 years away from being realized and try to make them happen in five years' time. But they didn't have a long wait before they found their perfect mirror. \"To my own surprise, I found the answer during the very first meeting. I thought everyone would laugh at my suggestion, so I waited until the last two minutes to talk and after I did, the room just fell silent,\" Fink, a former commander in the Israeli army, told CNN. He found that by taking two materials with different optical properties (one being a semi-conducting glass and one being a polymer) and stacking these two up in very tight and ultra thin layers, around 1 micron each (1/1000 of a millimeter), they create an omni-reflector. The most important part of his discovery, however, was that by changing only the thickness and distance of the layers, the \"perfect mirror\" could reflect any type of electromagnetic energy in any wavelength. This meant Fink's invention was useful not only in the military and telecommunications...",

Russian missile cruiser \"Peter the Great\" moored in Cape Town, South Africa, last month. The cruiser, Peter the Great, halted two small high-speed motor boats and a mid-size, support vessel on Thursday, the Russians said. \"Ten pirates have been detained. All of them are citizens of Somalia,\" the press release obtained by CNN stated. \"Officials from the Northern Fleet's military prosecutor's office are currently questioning the detainees aboard the Peter the Great. Their future will be decided in coordination with the Russian Foreign and Justice ministries.\" The Russians said a Russian helicopter Ka-27, which took off from the cruiser, had located two small boats, which were moving toward an Iranian fishing vessel at high speed last Thursday. When those in the boats spotted the helicopter overhead, the boats began slowing down, then veered off toward their support vessel, which was adrift nearby. The helicopter crew could see pirates in the two motor boats throwing weapons into the sea, and kept chasing the boats until the Russian cruiser arrived in the area. \"The three boats were (captured and) delivered to the Peter the Great, and ten Somalian pirates were taken aboard. \"The detainees possessed weapons, including a G-3 rifle, an Ak-47, two AKMS machine-guns, two grenade-launchers and two anti-infantry grenades, and also had a GPS receiver, a ladder, 500 grams of drugs, a large amount of money, a bag of sugar and a bag of rice. The detained pirates were high on drugs,\" the press release said. Meanwhile, Somali pirates have released a Panamanian-flagged, Japanese-owned vessel that was hijacked in the Gulf of Aden in November, according to a non-governmental group that monitors piracy.

The USB (Universal Serial Bus) is as relevant today as it was when the 12 millimeter by 4.5 millimeter ports and cables first started appearing back in the late 1990s, providing users with a discreet and straightforward way of transferring data between a range of digital devices. Today, more than 10 billion USB devices are believed to be in use around the world -- a statistic that has secured its co-inventor, Ajay Bhatt, a permanent place in computing's unofficial hall of fame. \"I was totally surprised by how it has impacted everybody. I mean, my name became a common name -- at least at schools and in technical communities,\" Bhatt said. The engineer's high standing in computing circles was famously celebrated in a 2009 advertising campaign by his employers, Intel, where an actor portraying Bhatt strutted into a lab full of starstruck co-workers. \"I truly get a rock star treatment and that is quite unusual to me -- people asking for your signature, people asking for your picture.\" His journey to digital immortality began in the early 1990s amid the growing tangle of chunky cables and portals which linked the separate devices on PCs and laptops. One cable would talk to the keyboard, Bhatt recalls, while another would connect a modem. A different cable enabled printing, with another linking the hard drive to the monitor. \"It was more difficult than it needed to be,\" he says. \"You were looking at two devices with connecting wires and you wanted things to happen but the rules weren't that simple. It was very difficult for the average person to use it. All the technology at that point was developed for technologists by technologists.\" He set about creating a single connection for computers across the entire industry.

UPDATED: . 13:20 EST, 2 May 2013 . The head teacher of a rival school allegedly injected the yoghurt with rat poison and left it on the road to the girls' school . Two schoolgirls have died in China after eating yoghurt poisoned by the head of a rival kindergarten, according to state media reports. The Xinhua News Agency said the girls' grandmother found the yoghurt, which was left in a bag with a pile of notebooks, on the road near their school in Pingshan county. She took the books and yoghurt back home and let the girls, aged five and six, have it when they came back from school. But as they played outside after drinking it they suddenly started foaming at the mouth and collapsed to the ground. The children were rushed to the local hospital where they began fitting, but they later died. It is believed the girls were sisters named Lu and Flowers. Chinese media reported six-year-old Lu died on the way to hospital, while her younger sister Flowers died a week later. Hebei Youth Daily said their grandmother, who it named as Renshu Ting, also tasted some of the yoghurt and spent a few days in hospital. Police said the yoghurt was poisoned with tetramine - a rat posion. Officers believe poisoning was motivated by competition for students between the schools, media reports said. Reports claimed the woman headteacher confessed to injecting rat poison into the yoghurt and asking a man to place it with notebooks on the road to the rival kindergarten, which is in Hebei province. She and the man who allegedly helped her put the yoghurt on the road were arrested after the incident on April 24. There was no response from police or Pingshan county's information office last night.

        "Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?\n\nArticle: (CNN) -- On Tuesday, new Apple CEO Tim Cook is expected to help unveil Apple's latest iPhone at its first big event since co-founder Steve Jobs stepped aside in August. Cook will no doubt be scrutinized for how he fulfills his new role Tuesday as chief pitchman for Apple's products. And the new iPhone, expected to go on sale sometime in mid-October, will almost certainly draw lines of shoppers outside Apple's stores. Then the question becomes: Can Apple make enough iPhones fast enough? As demand for its gadgets continues to skyrocket, keeping Apple growing at its amazing pace will be a key hurdle for Cook's regime. The consumer shift toward cheaper, portable computers -- and Apple's huge success there with the iPhone and iPad -- means creating and selling an ever-increasing number of devices each year. Right now, for example, Apple will have to ramp up production of millions of new iPhones, and possibly new iPods, for the holidays. After that there will be more iPads, Macs, and other products. It's important that Apple's new devices be stylish and technically impressive. But it's equally important that they be in stock when people want to buy them, something that Apple hasn't always been able to deliver. Only recently, for example, has the iPad 2 supply been able to meet demand. And as time goes on, thanks in part to new markets such as China, demand for each gadget will only grow. It's not enough for Cook and his team to keep coming up with exciting new products. They also must continue Apple's logistics revolution, so that consumers don't have to wait forever to buy new Apple devices -- or turn instead to the competition. Consider the total number of devices Apple must now have built and shipped per year. In 2011, including all iPhones, iPods, iPads, and Macs, Apple could end up shipping more than 175 million gadgets -- some 50 million more than it did last year, representing roughly 40% growth. Next year, Apple is expected to ship an all-time high of around 215 million devices, or another 40 million more...",

        "Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?\n\nArticle: (Real Simple) -- Here are some tips for keeping your plants healthy, plus suggested flowers and plants for container gardens. 1. Choose the pots . Make certain there are one or more holes in the bottom of your container to allow water to flow out freely. Insufficient drainage can cause roots to drown, and the plant to die prematurely. Almost anything can be used as a container for plants, so what type of pot you choose depends upon your style preference and budget. If you prefer lightweight containers, which are easy to move around and can weather winter temperatures, look for resin, fiberglass, and plastic. Added bonus: These materials are not porous, so they absorb less moisture than unglazed clay or wood -- leaving more for the plant. 2. Choose the potting mix . Do not use soil from the yard or garden. It can be filled with weed seeds, insects, and fungal diseases. Buy potting soil at your local garden center. It is a loose and light mixture of materials like peat moss, vermiculite, and, often, decomposed organic matter. If you are planting succulents or cacti, use a mix especially formulated for them. To reduce plant maintenance, buy potting mix containing a time-release fertilizer and moisture-retaining polymer crystals. If that type of mix is not available, buy a time-release fertilizer (such as Cockadoodle Doo) and a jar of water-retaining crystals (like Soil Moist) and follow the package directions for adding to the potting mix. 3. Choose the plants . Make \"Right plant, right place\" your motto. You must take into consideration the conditions of your space. Don't try to grow a flower like a rose -- which requires six hours of full sun -- on a porch that gets only an hour in the early morning. Do your homework (read books and plant tags), ask for advice at the garden center, and determine which plants will thrive in the available sun or shade. When deciding what to buy, the simplest approach is to use one kind of plant per pot. If you choose to combine multiple types of plants, make sure they all like...",

The registration -- which will run for 30 days -- was postponed once before, because registration materials were not ready. Voting is scheduled for January 9, leaving little room for other delays. \"We are worried; the time remaining is short and many things are not in place yet,\" said Hamilton Lugor, the deputy liaison officer for the government of Southern Sudan in Kenya. \"But what we will not allow is the referendum to be delayed even for one minute,\" he added. Diplomacy urgent as vote to split Sudan nears . People from Southern Sudan who live outside of the country will also have an opportunity to vote in the referendum in selected countries in Africa and the West. Another referendum will take place on the same day as that voting: that of Abyei, a disputed oil-rich border region between the North and the South which also wants to govern itself. Talks are being held in Ethiopia with the goal of breaking a stalemate between the two sides in regard to guidelines that will govern Abyei's referendum. The North insists that the Missiriya, a nomadic Arabic tribe, are eligible to vote in the Abyei referendum, but the South says only the permanently based Dinka tribe should have a right to vote. Recent media reports say that the Missiriya tribe has warned of war if its members are barred from voting. In a recent United Nations Special Summit on Sudan, the international community -- including U.S. President Barack Obama and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki moon -- reiterated its commitment to peace in Sudan and support for the upcoming referendums. More than 2 million people were killed in fighting between the North and South from 1983 to 2005, when a peace deal was finally brokered.

With just weeks before the nominating conventions and his national debut before a broader electorate, Romney's struggles to make the case that he is best equipped to pull the nation out of the economic doldrums could derail his quest for the presidency. Romney's biggest challenge? Turning the conversation back to the weak economy and poor job growth and away from President Barack Obama's re-election campaign's attacks on his tenure at private equity firm Bain Capital and refusal to release more tax records. Romney has stalled at this. Given the ailing economy, Romney should be faring much better, political experts say. \"One way to measure this is -- given the conditions of the country and the economy -- one would think the challenger would be ahead and he's not,\" said CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. His tax plan, the release of which was intended to offer a punctuation mark on how he'd handle the economy, was criticized by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The plan would provide large tax cuts to the very wealthy while increasing the tax burden on the lower and middle classes. It would make it tough to recoup lost government revenue, according to the Brookings study. And those campaign attack ads from Obama's campaign and those supporting it aren't helping. According to a CNN/ORC International poll of likely voters released Thursday, Romney's unfavorable rating jumped to 48% from 42% a month ago, a drop which followed a period in which the Obama campaign hammered the GOP presidential hopeful with a deluge of advertising and news stories about his time at Bain and calls for Romney to release more of his tax records, which he has refused to do.

Video from CNN affiliate Geo TV showed shops that had closed or were in the process of closing in Nazimabad, Liaquatabad and other parts of Karachi. \"There are elements that are forcing people to shut down their shops and businesses,\" local trade society president Tajir Ittehad Ateeq Mir told reporters. Such shutdowns have been connected to the arrest in London of Altaf Hussain, head of Pakistan's Mutahida Qaumi Movement, on Tuesday morning. Metropolitan Police said they arrested a 60-year-old man, who they did not name, at a home in northwest London on suspicion of money laundering. But officials in Pakistan subsequently identified him as Hussain. Members of the Mutahida Qaumi Movement, which is known as MQM, have staged protests, including sit-ins, since that arrest. But party officials insist they have nothing to do with shutting down businesses, accusing others of manipulating the situation. \"The MQM Central Coordination Committee has strongly condemned the miscreant elements who are involved in closing down businesses and aerial firing in some areas of Karachi and Hyderabad,\" the party said in a press release. \"It seems that some elements want to deteriorate the situation deliberately so that MQM can be blamed.\" The party appealed for people to go about their business as usual and remain peaceful, with senior leader Haider Abbas Rizvi telling reporters that Hussain himself has related that he doesn't want supporters to take the law into their own hands. MQM is the fourth-largest party in Pakistan's parliament, holding 25 out of 446 seats, though it is a greater force in Sindh province, including Karachi.

But Pogba fired home in stoppage-time to give his side all three points and help take advantage of Napoli's surprise defeat. Napoli, who began the night in second, went down 1-0 at Atalanta, courtesy of Carlos Carmona's first-half strike. That result allowed Inter Milan to move into third place after it came from behind to see off Sampdoria 3-2. Gianni Munari had given Sampdoria a 20th minute lead but Diego Milito grabbed his 200th career goal to bring his side level. Rodrigo Palacio and Freddy Guarin then put Inter in the driving seat and despite Eder grabbing a late consolation, the hosts held on to take the points. Lazio was held to a 1-1 draw by Torino as it slipped to fourth but it sits four points clear of fifth place Fiorentina. Parma moved up to sixth position following a 3-2 victory over Roma. Ishak Belfodil scored and was sent off as the hosts came from behind to see off a Roma side, which had taken an early lead through Erik Lamela. Belfodil equalised before Marco Parolo and Cristian Zaccardo put Parma 3-1 ahead with Francesco Totti's strike failing to bring Roma a reward. Elsewhere, Cagliari overcame Siena 4-2, Chievo defeated Pescara 2-0 and Udinese was held to a 2-2 draw by Catania. In Spain's Copa del Rey, Real Madrid carved out a 4-1 win away at Alcoyano.

The resolution, introduced by South Africa, is the first-ever U.N. resolution on the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered persons. It passed with 23 votes in favor, 19 opposed and three abstentions amid strong criticism of South Africa by some African nations.

If Russia brings its full military might to bear on its former satellite state, the Georgian military could find itself overcome quickly.

            "(CNN) -- With its heaving highways, glittering skyscrapers, contemporary art and design spaces, and countless new developments, Beijing is a thoroughly modern city. But beyond its contemporary facade are the remnants of hundreds of years of traditional history. Home to numerous ruling dynasties, Beijing is famed for its Forbidden City, a majestic court surrounded by high walls, once all but impossible to enter, which can now be visited by locals and tourists alike. Palaces temples and observatories dot the city, usually set in parks providing respite from the hustle and bustle. CNN's World's Treasures offers its top five picks of Beijing's traditional sites, from palaces laden with jaw-dropping artifacts to tranquil sculpted gardens that will -- almost -- make you forget you're in a buzzing modern metropolis. The Forbidden City . Built in the early 15th century, this gilded fortress was the seat of power during the Ming and Qing dynasties. With its breathtaking art and furniture and its sheer scale, the Forbidden City is a must on any Beijing travel itinerary. Visitors can easily lose themselves for hours admiring its opulence, sheltered from the outside world by high walls. Secret Garden of Beijing's Forbidden City garden revealed . The Summer Palace . Set in a landscaped park, the imperial court's summer residence is now a beautiful resting spot for the city-weary. Pavilions, temples and palaces make up the stunning vista, but perhaps the most memorable feature is a marble boat commissioned by the Empress Dowager Cixi. It also boasts the 900-meter Long Gallery -- home to paintings of mythological scenes -- and a lake on which you can row boats in summer and ice skate in winter. The Temple of Heaven . The Temple of Heaven, located in Beijing's Tiantan Park, was built in the 15th century during the Ming period and is admired for its complex architecture that symbolizes the meeting between heaven and earth, with the Emperor believed to have been the link between the two.

Christopher Bailey, Burberry's creative director, has been credited with the brand's resurgence. The brand credits much of its new a la mode image to creative director Christopher Bailey. The unassuming 37-year-old British designer has successfully reconnected Burberry with a trendy young audience -- using the likes of British super model Agyness Deyn, whom he has propelled to international stardom -- in ad campaigns. But times are hard for luxury brands, with a recession that has turned many high-end consumers toward cheaper alternatives. So how is Bailey handling the current economic climate? With stylish new headquarters in the heart of London and the recent opening of a Burberry Children's wear store in the capital, it seems the brand has kept its wheels rolling.  Watch Burberry's creative director speak to CNN \u00bb . Bailey believes the new headquarters were an important extension of Burberry's image, telling CNN \"the building is the brand beacon.\" \"It's so important that everyone lives and breathes the aesthetic of what Burberry is. We have to do what feels right for the company,\" Bailey added. But that does not mean that Burberry is ignoring the recession. \"It's all about the balance between functionality and emotion. You have to be instinctive about what's going on,\" said Bailey. \"We think about the world recession, but it helps us focus and make sure that the brand purity and integrity is there in everything we do. \"We've just opened our first [children's wear] store in London and the first signs are pretty wonderful.\" But Bailey agrees that \"there has been incredible excess in the last five to 10 years, so it's a good moment to re-balance.\" So how will that translate to the catwalk? \"The [clothes] will be investment pieces for the long-term.

Aviation record-holder Steve Fossett is missing and a search is under way. Maj. Cynthia S. Ryan of the Civil Air Patrol said Fossett, who has been missing for a day, once walked 30 miles to get help after making a forced landing. But Ryan noted the challenge rescuers are facing as they comb the high desert region, which is covered with sagebrush and hides deep ravines. Rescuers are focusing on 600 square miles. \"It's a very large haystack,\" she said. \"And an airplane is a very small needle. No doubt about that.\" The Civil Air Patrol has 10 aircraft that will be searching until dusk for Fossett, who has been missing since Monday afternoon, she said. The search will resume Wednesday at 7 a.m. (10 a.m. ET). Fossett, 63, was in a single-engine plane when he took off at 9 a.m. (noon ET) in good flying conditions from hotel magnate Barron Hilton's Flying M Ranch, Ryan said. He had planned to return to the ranch, which is about 30 miles south of Yerington, Nevada, at noon (3 p.m. ET). The search for him began about six hours later, Ryan said. Fossett did not file a flight plan, which is not required on flights using visual navigation. Fossett is the first person to solo around the world in a balloon, and has broken numerous other flight records. When he left, he had four to five hours of fuel for flight, said Ryan. \"Steve took off toward the south and was going to fly southbound, looking around for some dry lake beds for some plans he had for the future,\" Ryan said.

        "Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?\n\nArticle: Washington (CNN) -- Senior career executives of the U.S. agency responsible for processing key veterans benefits will not receive performance bonuses this year following congressional complaints that the government has been too slow to process disability claims. Josh Taylor, a spokesman for the Veterans Administration, said the Veterans Benefits Administration has eliminated bonuses to ensure executives responsible for a backlog of claims are not rewarded since performance goals were not achieved. \"Instead, the funds will be reinvested to accelerate elimination of the backlog. We remain confident that VBA senior executives are dedicated to our nation's veterans, and they will continue to lead our drive toward VA's goal: eliminating the claims backlog in 2015,\" Taylor said. The total bonus payout for career VA executives in fiscal year 2012 was $2.3 million, funds that will now be used to eliminate the backlog, according to an agency official with knowledge of the budget. The benefits administration total was not broken out. Political appointees, like Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, do not receive bonuses. The benefits administration processes disability, pension and other claims for the larger agency. The VA announced an initiative last week aimed at expediting decisions for veterans who have waited one year or longer for compensation claims. \"Too many veterans wait too long for decisions on their compensation claims, and that has never been acceptable. That's why VA has implemented an aggressive plan that will eliminate the decades-long compensation claims backlog in 2015,\" Taylor said. Lawmakers have been increasingly critical of the VA and are applauding the move to cut performance awards. \"VA employees and managers who fail in their jobs shouldn't receive bonuses -- they should be disciplined or fired,\" Rep. Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.",

Two members of FIFA's executive committee, Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii, have been provisionally suspended following allegations they were prepared to accept bribes in exchange for their votes for deciding the 2018 and 2022 hosts. Four other officials were also suspended ahead of a full hearing next month. The IOC expelled 10 members in 1999 following the bribery controversy in Salt Lake City's bid to host the 2002 Winter Games, and its president Jacques Rogge believes FIFA should take similar action. \"I think the IOC took the right conclusions on something that was very unpleasant,\" Rogge told reporters following an IOC executive board meeting in Acapulco, Mexico. \"We did everything we could and I'm sure the IOC came out of the crisis as a better and more transparent organization, and I hope that will also be the case for FIFA.\" The Belgian revealed that he had already spoken to his football counterpart Sepp Blatter following the outbreak of the corruption scandal. Blatter has already spoken out about the negative impact he believes the situation has had on the bidding process for the upcoming World Cup bids. \"He [Blatter] was so kind to call me when the whole issue emerged and he kept me informed about what he had done and the decision that had been taken by FIFA,\" Rogge said. \"I encouraged him to do exactly what he has done and to try to clean out as much as [corruption] possible.\" The 2018 World Cup will be hosted by a European nation following the United States' withdrawal, with England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Belgium-Holland vying for the rights.

Sumner was the centerpiece of the landmark 1954 Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education. The 11 sites represent the country's architectural, cultural and natural heritage, and \"reflect extraordinary periods of American history,\" National Trust Director Richard Moe said. The sites were chosen from about 70 nominees by the member-supported nonprofit group. Founded in 1949, it aims to protect significant buildings and locales, now protected under the 1966 Historic Preservation Act. Of the roughly 200 places listed by the organization in the past 20 years, the National Trust says only six have been lost. Moe said the list is designed to raise awareness. \"The 11 represent the different kinds of historic places in different parts of the country. It's a representative list,\" said Moe, who leads the organization of nearly 300,000 members. Endangerment doesn't necessarily mean the building is in the potential path of a bulldozer, according to Moe. Lack of funding can be just as serious, as the case of the California state parks demonstrates. The sites are listed in alphabetical order: .

A much deadlier 7.2 magnitude quake that tore through Van last month left 604 people dead, officials said. Twenty-six people have been rescued as a result of Wednesday's quake. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the Van region Saturday, as a heavy snowstorm hampered rescue efforts. The sleet, snow and plunging temperatures also worsened conditions for hundreds of thousands of earthquake survivors living outdoors. Freezing temperatures were expected to continue Sunday, with a bit of warming ahead Monday and Tuesday. \"It's not possible for us to survive the winter here. The Van winter is very cold and there's a lot of snow. Living in these shelters is impossible,\" Cezmi Fazla said. He stood outside a small hut his family constructed out of Styrofoam and plywood. The hut was on the road outside Fazla's house, which was still standing but badly damaged after the earthquakes. Ten to 15 family members slept in the hut every night, including his wife and youngest child, as well as his father and brother. Fazla said he sent his three oldest children to relatives in the western Turkish city of Izmir after the first earthquake . \"We haven't gotten any aid,\" he said. \"We got a lot of support from the people of Turkey, packages with everything from clothes to toothpaste. But the elected officials, the nongovernmental organizations are not making good use of it and were not good at coordinating those efforts. So people feel very panicked. That's made a lot of people uncomfortable.\" Frustration from earthquake survivors is palpable on the streets of Van, where almost all of the shops are closed after the earthquakes. \"I condemn Tayyip Erdogan,\" yelled Muhsin Tarhan, referring to Turkey's prime minister.

The secretive state also plans to erect a statue of Kim Jong Il and build towers across the country to symbolize his \"immortality,\" the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported, citing orders from the leaders of the ruling Workers Party. North Korea announced Kim Jong Il's death on December 19, putting the region on edge as observers speculated about the nuclear-armed regime's stability and future direction. Pyongyang held an elaborately choreographed funeral procession and memorial ceremony the following week that served to underline the elevation of Kim Jong Un -- the youngest son and chosen successor of Kim Jong Il -- to the position of \"supreme leader\" of the country. On Thursday, the regime also announced that February 16, Kim Jong Il's birthday, will henceforth be known as \"the Day of the Shining Star.\" His father's birthday is dubbed \"the Day of the Sun\" in the North Korean calendar."

A court heard the couple were given \u00a3200 to wallpaper and decorate their new home. Gutted: John Flounders and his girlfriend Stacey Everett, 20, moved into the flat in Stockton on September 16 last year. Two weeks later their landlord visited to find the couple gone and the flat completely gutted . Smashed: The couple ripped up the floorboards to steal copper piping valued at \u00a31,000. And they tore the sink from the bathroom wall, leaving it smashed on the floor . Trashed: The work surfaces in the kitchen were wrenched from the cupboards . But instead they tore up the floorboards, pulled the sink from the bathroom wall and wrenched the kitchen work top from the cabinets. The heating and water system was destroyed, after the couple stole metres of copper piping from underneath the flooring. Teeside Crown Court heard the couple went on to burgle a house. Repeat offender Flounders, 19, was yesterday jailed while his girlfriend Everett, 20, was spared a custodial sentence after the judge recognised her 'potential' as she pursues an engineering career. The court heard the couple signed their tenancy agreement on September 16 last year, days after Flounders was released from custody for a previous offence. Career criminal: Nineteen-year-old John William Flounders was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in a young offenders' institution .

Advocates praise the move as a way to limit the influence of formula manufacturers on new mothers. Skeptics wonder whether the policy will shame women who choose not to breast-feed. As for my sister-in-law, Rachel, who recently gave birth in a Manhattan hospital to her first child, she knows first-hand how nurses pushing formula can impact an inexperienced mother. After her C-section, a nurse offered to give her newborn a bottle \"to make it easier on you.\" Exhausted and uncertain, she agreed \u2014 even though she'd intended to breast-feed. \"I was a new mom,\" she said. \"I didn't know what I was doing.\" Those are exactly the sorts of moms that Mayor Michael Bloomberg hopes to influence with his voluntary Latch On NYC initiative. When it goes into effect in September, nurses in participating hospitals will be instructed not to give formula to babies unless there's a medical reason to do so or unless moms specifically request it (they'll first have to listen to a mandatory speech about why breast is best). Formula will be locked away like medication, and staff will be required to sign it out, track its distribution and report those figures to the Health Department, which presumably wants to know whether the new policy will cut formula use citywide.

            "(CNN) -- The judicial equivalent of white smoke has risen: The Supreme Court has ruled in a split decision rejecting most of Arizona's controversial immigration policing law, SB 1070. Many were expecting a tough ruling favoring the Arizona statute and opening the floodgates to states' rights. And so the majority opinion is surprising as it upholds the federal government's power in setting immigration policy, leaving less room than many anticipated for state immigration enforcement. Decision and issues at a glance . The justices upheld the provision of most concern to immigrant rights advocates, requiring police to check the immigration status of people they stop for other reasons if the officers suspect that they are in the country illegally. But even that part of the opinion is tenuous, and it's far from certain what will happen next. Maybe it's a coincidence, but the court's hesitance to open the door to more state immigration enforcement is consistent with a new mood emerging in the states and nationally. Winners, losers in immigration policy debate? The past six years saw a federalist revolution in immigration lawmaking, with states taking more power into their own hands every year. But the mood in most state houses was strikingly different this spring, with lawmakers much less focused on immigration and in much less of a hurry to crack down. Read the immigration ruling (PDF) According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, state lawmakers considered far fewer bills mentioning immigration: Halfway through the legislative sessions, in March, the number was down by 44%. Only two or three states seriously considered far-reaching enforcement measures, and no state enacted a new law. (Alabama revised an existing law, mostly softening it.) Most surprising, no state took advantage of the opening created by last year's Supreme Court immigration decision, the ruling that states may act to prevent and punish the hiring of unauthorized immigrants, requiring employers to enroll in the federal E-Verify..."

That's slightly better than the $25 million or so that most in the industry were predicting, and would represent a solid start for many films. But it's a dismal showing for such a costly project. Both the movie and its marketing campaign are to blame for the soft opening. The film, which garnered mixed reviews and marked the first live-action undertaking for Pixar's Andrew Stanton (\"Finding Nemo,\" \"WALL-E\"), is based on Tarzan author Edgar Rice Burroughs' 1917 book \"A Princess of Mars.\" That book was the first in a series of Barsoom sci-fi novels that later influenced films such as \"Star Wars\" and \"Avatar.\" However, since the general public is not overly familiar with the Barsoom works, \"John Carter\" appeared derivative of the very things it inspired. Also not helping the movie out was its cast, headed by an unproven Taylor Kitsch (\"Friday Night Lights\"). True, \"Avatar\" featured the similarly untested Sam...",

Maplecroft said it worked with the U.N.'s World Food Programme to develop the criteria to judge 163 countries. The group came up with 12 categories to help make evaluations. Those categories included the nutritional and health status of populations, cereal production and imports, Gross Domestic Product per capita, natural disasters, conflict and the effectiveness of government, the group said. The United States was ranked No. 158. Finland got the best rank and was considered least at risk.",

As the Italian maestro closes in on an eighth world title, CNN charts the rise of the charismatic king of two wheels. Valentino Rossi celebrates his 102nd victory at the Brno Grand Prix in the Czech Republic. Born in Urbano, Italy in 1979, Valentino Rossi's achievements in the sport are nothing short of extraordinary. Eight world titles, 102 wins and over 150 podium finishes have already made him the most successful rider of all time. Rossi began racing karts as a ten-year-old, before moving to two wheels in 1992. Four years later in his first Grand Prix season he won -- aged seventeen -- at the Brno circuit in the Czech Republic in the 125cc World Championship. The following year he clocked up a record 321 points in winning his first 125cc World Championship title. 1998 was meant to be a learning year on the more powerful 250cc bikes, but Rossi finished second overall before going on to take the title the following season. His progress in the 500cc class in 2000 and 2001 followed an identical trajectory to that in Rossi's two seasons racing 250cc bikes. In 2002, he was crowned MotoGP champion in his first season, finishing 140 points clear of his nearest rival, one-time fight opponent and fellow countryman Max Biaggi.  Click here to view Rossi's career highlights \u00bb . Three more MotoGP titles -- including two for his new team Yamaha -- followed in succession. But when it seemed as if he was going to dominate MotoGP for the rest of the decade, Rossi experienced the first real blip in his career, crashing out of the final race of the 2006 season in Valencia. In the process, Rossi handed his rival -- American Nicky Hayden -- the title. A year later Rossi finished third. A poor season by his standards was compounded by the split from his long-term girlfriend Arianna Matteuzzi, a fall out with his manager Gibo Badioli and the Italian government chasing him for eye-watering...",

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- The music isn't new, but the discovery that a young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart \"almost certainly\" composed it is a stunning revelation. A researcher in Austria says the works were probably transcribed by Mozart's father, as young Mozart played. The two compositions -- a concerto in G and a prelude in G -- have long been in the files at the International Mozarteum Foundation in Salzburg, Austria, as anonymous works and were even published in the book \"New Mozart Edition\" in 1982. Now Ulrich Leisinger, director of the foundation's research department, believes the works actually were composed by Mozart before he was old enough to write music, and that Mozart's father, Leopold, transcribed them. The foundation said in a statement that Leisinger analyzed the handwriting and other \"stylistic criteria\" to determine the music was \"almost certainly unknown compositions by\" the young Mozart. The compositions were found in a book, compiled by Mozart's father, that was used for practice and the musical education of both Mozart and his sister, according to the statement. Leisinger's analyses \"support the claim that they were actually composed by the young Mozart, who was not yet versed in musical notation, and transcribed by his father as the boy played the works at the keyboard,\" the statement said. Jeffrey Kimpton, president of the Interlochen Center for the Arts in Michigan, called the works \"a remarkable historical find.\" He said Leopold Mozart transcribed his son's early works as a way of preserving them. \"When parents go to a piano recital of an early student, a young student, who's playing for the first time, they get a video tape, they get a DVD, that's a way of recording it,\" Kimpton said. \"I think what's exciting is that Mozart's father wanted to preserve this incredible genius. The young boy at this time didn't know how to write music, but he sure could play it. It's like a family photo or video album.\" Finding such historical treasures is like detective work, Kimpton said. \"You're kind of putting...",

And right now, President Barack Obama is living the part, in a big way: He's the civil libertarian defending an activist drone program. He's the liberal with a spy agency caught eavesdropping on the private conversations of friendly leaders. And he's the high-tech health care reformer whose website got stuck at Go. And so the ultimate irony may be this -- a President who extols the virtues of government has now been sucked into the big government vortex, experiencing (up close and personal, as they say) what it feels like to lose control to the bureaucrats. The ones who are afraid to deliver bad news, not to mention those who don't deliver the news at all. (As in, \"the website crashed.\") And the surveillance chiefs who, um, didn't initially volunteer that they're spying on the private phone lines of America's best friends. Maybe the President needs to figure out some new communications tools to make himself clear. (As in, \"Angela Merkel's cell is not just another data point.\") Obama, we're told, is frustrated and angered by the pathetic rollout of his signature legislative achievement. He's also clearly re-examining how the National Security Agency decides to target friendly leaders, what we get from it and why we need it at all. A couple of ex-intelligence officials tell me they're not shocked gambling was going on in Casablanca. (\"Our job is to know things,\" says one.) Whether the President should have known about the monitoring of these specific heads of state is another matter entirely -- and best left to intelligence aficionados. I've asked -- and gotten answers on both sides of the argument. But here are the larger questions that play into both the website fiasco and the NSA issues: How can a President take control of his own government?

            "(CNN) -- Throngs of revelers gathered around Times Square in New York City early Sunday to ring in the New Year amid cheers, glittering confetti and fireworks in one of many festivities worldwide. Crowds erupted in cheers, kissed and hugged as the giant ball dropped at midnight to mark the start of 2012. \"This is crazy, it's doggone warm,\" said Gary Grieco of College Point New York, who attended the unusually warm festivities this year. Grieco said he hopes this year is better than the last and outlined his resolutions for the New Year. \"Quit smoking, that's my promise ... today is the day,\" he said. iReport: NEW YEAR'S OPEN STORY . From London to Samoa, the world ushered in 2012 and said goodbye to a year marked by natural disasters, economic turmoil and other highlights such as the end of the Iraq war. \"Natural disasters were pretty brutal and the end of the Iraq war was long overdue,\" Grieco said. Fireworks lit up the sky over London's River Thames as the clock struck midnight -- one of many festivities worldwide. As Big Ben chimed on midnight, the sky exploded with pyrotechnics to mark the start of what Mayor Boris Johnson promised to be \"the most extraordinary and exciting year we are likely to see in our lifetime in this city.\" In 2012, London will host the Summer Olympics and pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth's diamond jubilee marking her 60 years on the throne. England was relatively late to the party, which began 14 hours earlier (at 5 a.m. ET) in Samoa, Tokelau and the Christmas Islands in the western Pacific. Samoa and Tokelau -- historically the last to celebrate the new year -- reveled in being the first to party this time round, after skipping west across the international dateline, missing out on December 30 entirely in the process, in a move intended to boost trade.

The two people had phoned in the same name based on the sketches, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said during the BBC's \"Crimewatch\" program, which aired an appeal Monday night for information about a man police want to track down. The man was seen carrying a child matching McCann's description on the night she vanished in 2007 around the resort town of Praia da Luz in Portugal. The man is described as white, between 20 and 40 years old, with short brown hair and a medium build. He was seen carrying a blond child, who might have been in pajamas and who was estimated to be 3 to 4 years old, around the time Madeleine disappeared, police had said. The sketches are based on descriptions from separate witnesses, investigators said. Since the program aired, British police said they have received more than 300 phoned tips and 170 e-mailed ones. \"We will now take the time to follow up these lines of enquiry,\" Redwood said. Police target 38 'people of interest' in Madeleine McCann's '07 disappearance . The latest revelation is critical in reconstructing what exactly happened more than six years ago on the night of May 3, 2007,when McCann disappeared from her family's villa while her parents dined at a nearby restaurant. The girl was just days shy of her fourth birthday. Neither her parents nor the detectives investigating her case have given up on one day finding the little girl from Leicestershire, England. \"There may be an entirely innocent explanation of this man, but we need to establish who he is to assist with our inquiries,\" Redwood said earlier. Additionally, investigators believe they have a better understanding of when Madeleine may have been abducted, Redwood added. \"The timeline we have now established has..."

But perhaps it isn't surprising when Xavier de Le Rue describes his relationship with nature as a need, or a drug. It is also a synergy that provides solace in the wake of bitter disappointment, such as finding out your Winter Olympics dream is finally over. \"This huge avalanche took me 2 km down the mountain,\" the Frenchman tells CNN's Human to Hero series of the moment he feared nature had finally beaten him. \"It was one of these perfect days and you forget that in a split second, things can change radically and then, suddenly the whole mountain broke around me. \"It is a miracle that I survived because I was lying on top of six meters of snow, completely broken with blood coming out of every hole in my body and completely unconscious.\" Unsurprisingly, that near-death experience six years ago launched a wave of introspection. \"I asked myself for months whether I should keep going or not, whether what I was doing was stupid,\" the 34-year-old says. \"I realized that I loved it even more than I thought and but I've always had these rules in my head to be more scared about everything all the time, but at the same time being a lot more focused. \"I think that right now, if I am freaked out about safety I will do no compromise.

He is a four-time world champion, a three-time winner of the overall World Cup title and has three X-Games gold medals to his name.

This is Senegal's national dish and recently my task for \"Inside Africa\" was to search for its origins, prepare the ingredients and taste a sample of the West African culture. What I discovered were firm family bonds, handmade artwork and a flavorful surprise. So let's rewind. Africa's westernmost nation hugs the North Atlantic coastline and for generations, life in the sea has sustained life on land. Soumbedioune, one of the many fishing beaches of Dakar, is illustrative of this symbiotic bond. As I walk its crowded sandy shoreline, narrow wooden boats approach from the horizon. Men darkened by hours at sea hop out of the brightly colored vessels. Yellow, red, green, white, all dance along the hull in bold fashion revealing a variety of circular designs. These traditional boats are hand painted and crafted by teams of men working in this busy fishing community. See also: Taking a look inside Zambia . In fact, as I watch with confusion at the apparent chaos around me, a methodical process emerges. Young boys run up to the boats, placing rollers underneath as the men hand off large coolers of fresh fish, proceeding to push the boat inland. The boys, typically sons or nephews of the fishermen, then wheel or carry the coolers to the women in the family waiting on the beach nearby. But this is no leisurely endeavor. The women work as a sort of broker for their husbands, displaying the best catch prominently. I hear empassioned sales pitches in French as they try to attract restaurant vendors and others searching for a good price for buying in bulk. The entire process happens in two waves each and every day, each family member with their own essential role. I learned not to get in the way either.

In a jittery post-9/11 world, it's small wonder the incident has raised concerns.

They said the suspects stole numerous items from the truck, and likely did not target the keys. Moreover, the officials said they quickly took unspecified steps to secure the region's transit system. The incident occurred just across an interstate from the Pentagon between 4 a.m. and 4:30 a.m., while the crew tended to a patient. An on-board video-camera captured images of the thieves as they either approached or departed the truck, Arlington Police Department spokesman Dustin Sternbeck said. Both Sternbeck and Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said numerous items were lifted, including the Metro keys. Both declined to say how many keys were taken, or what the keys opened. The fire crew reported the theft promptly, Sternbeck said, and canine dogs were sent to the scene. Sternbeck said police have not released the video of the suspects, but might if detectives feel it would help the investigation."

According to the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, 35% less women visited India in the three months after the attack compared to the same period last year. Since December, rapes have persisted and mass protests have erupted across the country, pointing at inefficiency in dealing with such crimes and an inherent patriarchal nature.

He is setting out a plan of action with Magic Bus --- an established NGO in India -- that uses sport to engage children from poorer communities, teaching values such as the importance of education, health and gender equality. \"Young people in India don't have good role models aside from Bollywood and sports people,\" says Matthew Spacie, Magic Bus founder. \"Farhan is a great voice addressing young people.\" Parvati Pujari, 22, is one of around 10,000 youth leaders recruited from within communities to deliver the NGO's programs. She says boys are aware of the rape problem and the need for change. \"But somewhere in their minds, they see girls as weak,\" she adds. The programs focus on building confidence in girls, for example, to ask for the ball from boys in a game of football, and encouraging boys to believe girls can play as well as they can.

Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, 36, admitted that on the night of December 14, 2010, he and four others were looking for drug traffickers to rob them of marijuana. The group encountered Terry and other Border Patrol agents along Arizona's border with Mexico and a gun battle broke out. Seeking justice for Brian Terry . In his plea agreement, Osorio-Arellanes agreed the shot that killed Terry was fired by a member of his group although he did not claim to have personally fired the shot or blame someone else specifically for the crime. The Terry case has been controversial because two rifles from the \"Fast and Furious\" operation were found at the scene of his killing. But U.S. officials have not produced evidence proving that Terry was killed with either of those guns. Osorio-Arellanes was wounded and arrested at the scene. He appeared in court in Tucson on Tuesday to plead guilty to one count of first degree murder. As part of the deal prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty and dropped other charges against him. He faces up to life in prison when sentenced in January. Four others were charged with roles in the gun battle and Terry's death, including one who was captured in Mexico in September and is awaiting extradition. The other three remain at large. \"Agent Terry was killed in the line of duty courageously safeguarding our border,\" said Laura Duffy, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California. \"Our country owes him and his family a great debt of gratitude for his ultimate sacrifice in service to our country.

The blow left the victim unconscious and not breathing on the field, Livonia Police Chief Curtis Caid said. After the attack, the player fled the field and waved his middle finger at the crowd. Bieniewicz was in critical condition when he reached the hospital and was pronounced dead Tuesday morning. \"John Bieniewicz was a man who lived life to the fullest,\" friends wrote on a website dedicated to his memory. \"He had a passion for his family, a passion for the kids at Mott Children's Hospital, and a passion for soccer. John died doing what he loved: Officiating a soccer game.\" The Wayne County Medical Examiner's office will determine the cause of death, according to Livonia police. The alleged attacker, Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad, 36, was charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder. He was being held on $500,000 bail, police said. He pleaded not guilty. The investigation is ongoing and authorities \"anticipate the criminal charges to be modified as a result of Mr. Bieniewicz's death,\" police said.

Twenty-two members of the league's Board of Governors rejected the Kings' relocation bid, while eight voted in favor. Commissioner David Stern cited the existence of a \"strong ownership group,\" a construction team and plan to build a new arena, plus strong support from Sacramento's mayor and others in the region, as reasons why the Kings will remain in northern California. \"I would say it's a victory for Sacramento, not the NBA,\" Stern told reporters, applauding the \"excellent\" if ultimately unsuccessful Seattle bid. Wednesday's vote follows months of talks between members of the Maloof family, the majority owners of the Kings, and a Seattle-based group that includes investor Chris Hansen and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. In January, these two parties reached a deal for that group to buy the Maloofs' 53% share of the team as well as minority owner Bob Hernreich's 12% stake. But that agreement needed the OK of the NBA's Board of Governors to go through. It didn't happen. The Maloof family and Hansen's group, though, kept on talking, leading to another deal (for a higher price) and this week's scheduled vote by the NBA board. Meanwhile, Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson -- himself a former all-star NBA guard -- kept pushing to keep the Kings in his city. That involved crafting a stadium plan and working with a group of individuals committed to keeping the team in Sacramento. Stern said that over the \"next 24 to 48 hours,\" NBA officials will talk to the Maloofs to try to \"facilitate an agreement\" for them to sell the Kings to the so-called Ranadive group, thus assuring the team remains in California. And he vowed \"fair dealing and ultimate consideration down to the road\" for any future efforts to land an NBA team in Seattle, which saw its last franchise -- the Supersonics -- leave for Oklahoma City in...",

The first patient is expected to arrive in the United States on Saturday afternoon, U.S. officials said. The aircraft carrying that person will land at Georgia's Dobbins Air Reserve Base, then take off again for Liberia to get the second American infected with Ebola. Both are expected to head to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, according to Dr. Bruce Ribner, who oversees the special isolation unit where they will be treated. On Friday, he described the patients as \"stable\" and \"safe to transport.\" There was an Ebola strain tied to monkeys -- Ebola-Reston -- in the United States during the 1990s, though no humans got sick from it, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thus, what is happening now appears to be the first time a symptomatic person with Ebola will be in the country and treated at a U.S. hospital. The Emory unit -- created in conjunction with the CDC, which is based down the road -- that will care for these patients is designed to optimize care for those with infectious diseases while safeguarding health care workers and visitors. Emory's hospital is one of only four U.S. institutions capable of such care, according to Ribner. 'Training for this': Atlanta hospital ready . He pointed out many precautions in place to prevent the deadly virus from spreading. These include controlling everything that comes into and out of the unit, \"special air handling\" and windows and an intercom so guests can interact with patients without being in the room. As one of four physicians overseeing the patients' treatment, Ribner said, \"I have no concerns about either my personal health or the health of the other health care workers who will be working in that unit.\" Ebola isn't \"some mystical pathogen (with) some bizarre mode of transmission,\" the doctor noted, adding...",

Obama, speaking in Estonia ahead of a NATO summit in Wales, said he was aware of the reported deal, as conflicting accounts emerged from Russia and Ukraine. But he said it was too early to see if all sides would follow through. Any ceasefire effort has not worked up to now, he said, \"either because Russia has not supported it or pretended it is not controlling the separatists\" in eastern Ukraine. \"Having said that, if in fact Russia is prepared to stop financing, arming, training and in many cases joining with Russian troops' activities in Ukraine, and is serious about a political settlement, that is something that we all hope for,\" Obama said. Meanwhile, France, a member of NATO, won't be delivering the first warship it is due to deliver Russia as part of a 2011 contract, the office of French President Francois Hollande said. \"The President of the Republic has noted that, despite the prospect of a ceasefire that remains to be confirmed and implemented, the conditions for France to authorize the delivery of the first (warship) are not authorized,\" the statement said.

Methods of torture reported by detainees include electric shocks; including to the genitals; partial suffocation with a bag placed tightly over the head; beatings while suspended in contorted positions; and the deprivation of food, water and sleep, Amnesty said. \"Detainees have alleged that they were tortured to force them to 'confess' to serious crimes or to incriminate others while held in these conditions,\" the group said. \"Many have repudiated their confessions at trial only to see the courts admit them as evidence of their guilt, without investigating their torture allegations, sentencing them to long term imprisonment or death.\" 129 hangings .

A total of 18 people have died in Bolivia as a direct or indirect consequence of low temperatures, the Peruvian state-run Andina news agency reported. The deaths were spread out throughout the country. On Monday, Bolivian officials said temperatures in the major city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra would reach 3 C (37 F), the lowest in 29 years, and in other regions the mercury dropped below freezing, Andina reported. As a precaution, Bolivian authorities canceled school from Monday to Wednesday, the official Bolivian news agency ABI reported. Police in Paraguay reported eight deaths from hypothermia and two from carbon monoxide poisoning from the use of heating devices. The government opened shelters for the poor, who are picked up at night by military trucks. Paraguayan authorities also estimated that 1,000 cattle died because of the cold. In Uruguay, local media reported two weather-related fatalities. The cold front hit the region on Saturday and was responsible for eight deaths in Argentina over the weekend. An area of low pressure in the southern hemisphere jet stream pushed deeper north allowing for cold Antarctic air to pool over Chile and Argentina. Below-normal temperatures are expected over the next 48 hours across the region. Argentina reported Monday that nine of its provinces were feeling temperatures below freezing. The intense cold will remain in the area at least through Tuesday, Argentina's official news agency, Telam, reported. Similarly, in Peru, the country's southern Amazon region was experiencing the coldest weather in three years, Andina reported, citing the National Meteorological and Hydrological Service.

            "Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Sala saunters in the red soil, her wrinkled skin glistening in the sun as she tries to keep up with the rest of the herd. It is hard to believe the 6-week-old, dwarfed by her human keeper, will grow up to be one of nature's biggest beasts. Until then, she lives at a Nairobi orphanage that takes in baby elephants struggling to survive. There, she walks around in the lush wilderness with her peers, drinks soy milk and waves her trunk playfully as her keeper applies sunscreen on her delicate skin. A red garment tied around her back keeps it safe from the sun's glare. Sala is one of scores of animals orphaned by drought, poaching and shrinking habitats, which have decimated wildlife across Kenya. The baby elephant was found wandering, alone and confused, after her mother died of starvation, her caretaker said. Conservation groups such as the David Sheldrick Foundation, where Sala is, have seen an influx of wildlife. The foundation takes in orphaned elephants and rhinos from across the country, a popular tourist destination because of its animals. \"You know if a human child came in need of care, you wouldn't put a bullet in or turn it away,\" said Daphne Sheldrick of the foundation. \"Elephants are the same. ... Whatever comes in, we have to make space.\" The facility has more than 20 elephants in Nairobi and more at another center in Tsavo National Park, where they are also rehabilitated. Kenya depends on tourism as a main source of income. Sala taps into that to help earn the $900 monthly cost for her upkeep. She slushes and slides in a mud bath for throngs of tourists and uses her trunk to nudge the only other person she dwarfs -- a squirming toddler. Sala and the other animals will be released back into the wilderness when they are old enough, which takes years. Long after they are gone, their caretakers will still worry about the fragile animals they help nurture. \"After working with these elephants, it's no longer just a job,\" said Edwin Lusichi, the chief keeper. \"It is from inside your..."

The popular 21-day Annapurna Circuit takes trekkers in a horseshoe-shaped route around a majestic segment of the Himalayas in Nepal. On the 10th day of the tour, Chaudhary and his clients, two young Israeli women, were descending from the highest point of the trail, Thorung La Pass, to the next destination, a walk that would normally take about seven hours. Now, after more than 10 hours of heading downhill, the snow pelted. The flurry fell heavier and faster, obstructing their vision. There was nowhere to stop or rest; they had to keep walking. \"You couldn't see the trail, there was snow everywhere, making it easy to get lost,\" said Chaudhary. \"It was all white, in the distance you could only see shadows of people walking.\" Some wandered off the trail. As the blizzard continued, their feet sunk into the snow pile. As their steps became heavier, they began to cry. As the hours passed, Chaudhary could make out backpacks and supplies strewn on the snow. \"There were people who had fallen, or were stuck or resting along the way. I couldn't tell if I saw a dead body.\" Conditions in the Himalayas can be cruel. But trekkers dying in snowstorms on the Annapurna Circuit is almost unheard of -- until this year. Deadly year . Nepal, known for its fabled Himalayas including Mount Everest, has endured a deadly, tragic year. In April, a hanging glacial mass collapsed and tumbled through a dangerous route on Everest, killing 16 Sherpas in the worst single disaster. Months later, an unseasonal snowstorm struck Annapurna, killing at least 43 people including locals and foreign tourists. Were the disasters just prone to happen or was climate change a factor? Everest mountaineers have spoken of changes they've witnessed for years. \"In my first journey, there was snow and ice,\" said Apa Sherpa, a retired mountaineer who made his first summit in 1990. \"Now we can...",

        "Summarise the article:\n\nAlthough you may think that bottled water is a safer option than tap, two new reports show that the store-bought stuff is actually less regulated than the water you get out of your faucet for free. What's in your water? You may be hard pressed to find out, reports the Environmental Working Group. The Food and Drug Administration has little authority to regulate bottled brands, according to a U.S. Congressional report released recently. While municipal water utilities are required to provide public reports of test results, bottled-water makers are not. (On the other hand, well water, which is found in many rural areas, isn't regulated as water provided by towns and cities is.) So although you may fork over a pretty penny for bottled water, that doesn't mean it's any better than what's coming out of your faucet. In fact, it could be worse and you'd never know it. The new research is backed by a second report from the Environmental Working Group. The nonprofit advocacy organization surveyed the labels and Web sites of nearly 200 popular bottled-water brands and found that less than 2 percent disclosed three important facts that can affect safety: the water's source, purification methods, and chemical pollutants in each bottle. (See the full report on bottled water at EWG's Web site.) \"We're really pushing for a consumer's right to know what's in their water,\" says Nneka Leiba, an environmental health researcher at the EWG. \"This isn't a doomsday scenario. It isn't that the claims are false; it's just that they are misleading.\" Reaching for the most popular bottled brands isn't necessarily a solution. In fact, the EWG report found that some of the best-known brands -- for example Whole Foods and San Pellegrino -- are the least likely to report where the water comes from and what it contains. Health.com: Plastic recycling gets easier . \"This probably has to do with the fact that they're imported, so the regulations are different,\" says Leiba. \"Some of the brands you think wouldn't be as transparent, like Walgreens...",

Tendai Biti said he had released about $40 million of the $132 million the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission needs for the July 31 vote, \"but we are far away from reaching the target. We do not have the money. We can't increase taxes.\" Biti is a member of Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change party (MDC). \"I have been in touch with the (Southern African Development Community) secretariat on the issue of trying to raise funds from the region. So it is something we are going to pursue. In fact it is something we have already started pursuing. We spoke to four countries in the region today.

The 89-year-old Mugabe had claimed victory over Tsvangirai, the opposition leader at the time. Robert Mugabe: Fast Facts - Morgan Tsvangirai: Fast Facts . Biti said he had written to Mugabe asking him to force diamond-mining companies controlled by his party, ZANU PF, to release more than $150 million in profit they made in June. He added that his efforts to get international funding from the United Nations had been frustrated by Zimbabwe's justice minister, Patrick Chinamasa, a ZANU PF member. The UN said in March it was prepared to fund Zimbabwe's elections. But that fell through after its assessment mission was barred by Chinamasa from entering the country. That has left Harare with few options for funding; one such is the SADC. While launching his reelection bid Friday, Mugabe threatened to pull out of SADC, accusing it of being biased against ZANU PF.

Kathy Gloddy was found murdered a mile from where she was last seen. The German shepherd returned home that day without its 13-year-old master, Kathy Gloddy. To her family's horror, the little girl's body was found the next day, three miles from her home. She had been beaten, raped, strangled and run over by a car repeatedly until she was dead. Her body was found clothed only in her kneesocks. At the time, police had several possible suspects, but not enough evidence for an arrest, said Sgt. Scott Gilbert of the New Hampshire State Police. In 2006, Gilbert said, Kathy's body was exhumed in search of further clues, but authorities were unable to obtain forensics from the remains. Kathy's family asked private investigator Tom Shamshak to aid in the investigation and he agreed to volunteer his services. So far, investigators have only been able to piece together a timeline of the day Kathy went missing.  Watch an update on the case \u00bb . It is believed that she left her family's home at 5 p.m. to go to a convenience store, where she bought ice cream and potato sticks. Soon after leaving the store, she was spotted at Franklin High School, where one of her older sisters was attending a banquet. It is unclear where Kathy went next, but what is known is that later that evening her dog returned home acting frantic and anxious, family members said. \"When Tasha came home without Kathy, we were worried,\" said Kathy's sister, Janet Young. \"And then the dog was running around in circles, acting crazy and pawing at the door as if looking for Kathy. We always came home when we said we would and never stayed out late worrying our parents.\" Private investigator Shamshak said he believes the killer may not have been a stranger. \"This kind of brutality and rage-driven crime can only come from someone that knew her or her family,\" he said.

Cardenas Guillen, 42, was the leader of the Matamoros, Mexico-based Gulf cartel until his capture in 2003. He was subsequently extradited to the United States to face drug trafficking charges in 2007. U.S. District Judge Hilda Tagle handed down the sentence Wednesday, following an earlier guilty plea by the drug kingpin. Under Cardenas Guillen's leadership, the Gulf cartel was responsible for smuggling thousands of kilograms of cocaine and marijuana into the United States, the FBI said in a news release. According to the FBI, in 1999 Cardenas Guillen threatened to kill a U.S. undercover sheriff's deputy. In another incident, he threatened the lives of two U.S. agents. \"The successful prosecution of Cardenas Guillen underscores the joint resolve of the United States and Mexico to pursue and prosecute the leadership of the drug trafficking cartels, dismantle their organizations and end the violence and corruption they have spawned,\" U.S. Attorney Jose Angel Moreno said. Cardenas Guillen pleaded guilty to five felony charges, including conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, conspiracy to launder money and threatening to assault and kill federal agents. Tagle also fined Cardenas Guillen $100,000 and ordered him to five years probation once his sentence is served. He is not eligible for parole.",

The Whale Alert App was launched at the start of April and produces up to the minute data regarding sightings of right whales near busy shipping lanes off the north east coast of America. The program is a collaborative effort between 13 different organizations including the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the International Fund for Animal Welfare. See also: How Flickr can help save the whales . Although there are only a handful of incidents between ships and the giant mammals each year, any collision that leads to a right whale fatality can have a major impact on the species status due to its severely depleted numbers. \"The right whale is one of the most endangered large animals on the planet, there are only between 350 to 550 of them left\" says David Wiley of the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. \"If a ship strikes a reproductive female then the mortality impact could be very large in terms of what it means for the overall population,\" adds Wiley. The Whale Alert App works by collating up to the minute reports from all the organizations involved in tracking or researching right whales in the United States. See also: Rare dolphins boosted by sea sanctuary . This information is then used to pinpoint right whales straying within a five kilometer radius of major shipping lanes. Ship captains with access to the free app via their iPhone or iPad can then reduce their speed, change course or increase their vigilance so as to avoid a potential collision. \"By increasing mariners ability to comply with regulations and protective measures, you increase protection for the right whales (as well as) decreasing the chance that mariners will be fined for violating (those) regulations,\" says Wiley . \"NOAA has fined some ships up to $92,000 dollars for going too fast repeatedly in...",

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- On Tuesday, President Barack Obama pledged $263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50,000 police officers. On Wednesday, a grand jury declined to charge the New York Police Department officer whose chokehold contributed to the death of Eric Garner -- an incident captured in full on video. Unsurprisingly, Thursday brought cries of \"what's the use?\" After all, an officer walked even though there is a video of the killing. So, body cameras must not make any difference, right? Wrong. The fact is that even though the grand jury decided not to charge Officer Daniel Pantaleo over Garner's death, having a video of the incident has still had a huge impact -- without the video, the story wouldn't be leading the headlines, and protesters wouldn't have assembled to demand change. Also, the video of Garner's arrest came from a cell phone, not from a police body camera. Would Pantaleo have used a banned chokehold if he knew his supervisor would be reviewing video of the arrest? Probably not. A body camera might therefore have saved Garner's life. People act better when they know they're being watched -- or recorded. Cops act better, and the people they encounter on the street are more cooperative. A study commissioned by the Police Foundation in 2012, for example, found that cops with body cameras were involved in far fewer use of force incidents than cops without. Opinion: Are police body cams really the answer? That same year, I praised Daytona Beach (Florida) Police Chief Michael Chitwood for his decision to fund and deploy body cameras for many of his officers, and the footage captured has helped me in cases I have handled. And, taking a broader perspective, the transparency inherent in such a program has also helped instill more trust among residents of the city. \"The cameras help defuse some of the tensions that might come up during encounters with the public,\" Chitwood said. \"I think that 98% of the time, cameras help improve relationships with the community.\" We should also be careful...",

Baker, who blogs under the name \"The Militant Baker\" and wears a size 22, changed the brand's A&F logo to \"Attractive & Fat\" in a mock, black-and-white Abercrombie ad to challenge the line's branding efforts. The photos come as a provocative response to contentious comments Abercrombie CEO Mike Jeffries made in a 2006 Salon article about the multibillion-dollar brand's target audience. \"In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids,\" Jeffries said. \"Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.\" The divisive remarks resurfaced earlier this month after a series of protests went viral, from Greg Karber's video of himself giving homeless people Abercrombie clothing to a Change.org petition for larger sizes by a teenage eating disorder survivor. The plus-size community particularly took umbrage to the CEO's business model because the retailer currently does not offer clothes above size 10 or large for women. \"I challenge the separation of attractive and fat, and I assert that they are compatible regardless of what you believe,\" Baker, 26, wrote in a public letter addressed to the CEO. Jeffries has since apologized in a statement: \"While I believe this 7-year-old, resurrected quote has been taken out of context, I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense.\" Baker spoke to CNN about Jeffries' comments and her motivations to address them.

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- The investigation into the controversial shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by a police officer in a St. Louis suburb has been completed, the St. Louis County prosecutor's office said Wednesday. Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed the 18-year-old in the middle of the day on August 9 after telling Brown and a friend to get out of the street. Authorities could have charged Wilson themselves by filing a criminal complaint, but St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch instead opted to present the case to a grand jury to decide whether to indict the officer. Ferguson mayor: Our eyes opened to racial problems . \"The investigation has been basically completed that is being conducted by both the FBI and St. Louis County PD,\" Ed Magee, the spokesman for the prosecutor's office, told CNN. A grand jury is expected to decide by mid-November whether Wilson will be charged criminally for the shooting, which sparked weeks of unrest on the streets of Ferguson and calls for a federal civil rights investigation. The white police officer's shooting of the black teenager was heavily debated throughout the nation. The grand jury, which began meeting in August, is expected to consider whether a crime was committed and if \"probable cause\" exist that Wilson committed that crime. Some witnesses have said Brown assaulted the officer at the outset and tried to grab his gun. Others fingered Wilson as the aggressor. A private autopsy conducted for the Brown family showed that Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head. Last month, two contractors doing construction work in Ferguson on the day Brown was killed, describe the teenager with his hands up in the air as he was gunned down. The men, who asked not to be identified after CNN contacted them, said they were about 50 feet away from Wilson when he opened fire. A video captured their reactions during the moments just after the shooting. \"He had his f**n hands up,\" one of the men said in the video. The men...",

        "Extract key points from the article based on which the stock market could react:\n\n(CNN) -- For all the heavy baggage that she carries, Hillary Clinton is walking on water. Ham-fisted attempts by the Republicans to smear her brain have backfired horribly (rightly so; they were distasteful), while Republican efforts to hang Benghazi around her neck (Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tried this weekend) have barely dented her popularity among Democrats. Obama calls her a \"buddy\" who would make a \"very effective\" president, and the former secretary of state remains clear front-runner for her party's 2016 presidential nomination. In fact, right now, she's the only real runner. And that can't be healthy -- for democracy, for the Democrats or even for Clinton. How can we be sure she's running? Well, the United States might be the only country in the world where a politician signals his or her ambitions by writing a book. This does not, alas, mean that America's politicians are unusually literate. Often, the book is bad; usually, it's ghostwritten; only occasionally is it worth reading. But it's generally a sign. The title of Hillary Clinton's \"Hard Choices\" -- out on June 9 and helpfully promoted by a series of interviews with TV's biggest anchors -- suggests a woman who is trying to make sense of a troubled recent past. Becoming Obama's secretary of state, Egypt, Libya and the Benghazi fiasco were all arguably \"choices\" forced upon her. That they were \"hard\" implies an admission that the outcome was far from desirable. Clinton is a potential presidential candidate who has to deal with not just one compromised record but two. First, the Bill Clinton administration; second, the Obama administration. In both cases, she seems keen to remind us, she wasn't technically in charge. Such is the strange ambiguity of Hillary Rodham Clinton. First, she was the co-president and architect of Bill's most ambitious domestic reforms, the anti-Tammy Wynette. Then, she was the betrayed wife who did stand by her man. Next the liberal senator, the presidential candidate of the overwhelming...",

A top VA official confirmed to a congressional committee on Friday that 78% of VA senior managers qualified for extra pay or other compensation in fiscal year 2013 by receiving ratings of \"outstanding\" or \"exceeds fully successful,\" and that all 470 of them got ratings of \"fully successful\" or better. Such widespread laudatory performance appraisals occurred shortly before CNN started reporting in November how veterans waited excessive periods for VA health care, with some dying in the process. The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care. In Phoenix, CNN reported in April that the VA used fraudulent record-keeping -- including an alleged secret list -- that covered up the waiting periods. A fatal wait: Veterans languish and die on a VA hospital's secret list . That didn't stop the head of the Phoenix VA medical center, Sharon Helman, from getting an $8,500 bonus last year. Helman's bonus got rescinded earlier this year after the VA controversy made headlines.

The petition was filed in June by Dave Holloway, Beth Holloway's ex-husband. It will be heard in a Jefferson County, Alabama, probate court on Friday. Natalee Holloway was 18 and had just graduated high school in the Birmingham, Alabama, suburb of Mountain Brook when she disappeared on a celebratory trip with classmates to Aruba in 2005. \"Beth intends to oppose Dave's inexplicable effort to have Natalee declared dead,\" attorney John Q. Kelly said in a statement. \"Beth gave birth to and raised Natalee, and will always hope and pray for Natalee's safe return.\" Last week, Dave Holloway's attorney said he filed the petition because he \"is seeking closure for his family.\" \"This is a normal proceeding for families when a loved one has been missing for an extended period of time,\" attorney Karen Hennecy said in a statement. \"Alabama law requires a waiting period of five years when a body has not recovered and no death certificate has been issued.\" \"If Dave seeks closure on such a personal and sensitive matter, it should be respected, but not imposed upon Beth in such an adversarial and public manner,\" Kelly said Thursday. Beth Holloway said in a statement last week, issued through her Natalee Holloway Resource Center, which aids families of missing persons, that she learned about the filing when she was handed documents by a process server while addressing a conference in Georgia. Natalee Holloway's disappearance remains unsolved. A suspect, Joran van der Sloot, was arrested but never charged in connection with the disappearance. He was indicted on federal extortion charges last year after prosecutors accused him of offering to sell information about the location of Holloway's remains in exchange for $250,000. Van der Sloot is awaiting trial on murder charges in Peru in the death of a woman whose body was found in his hotel room last year. If convicted,...",

            "Los Angeles (CNN) -- The security video system in Justin Bieber's mansion could be the best witness to the teen pop star's alleged egg attack on a neighbor. \"It was extensive,\" Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. David Thompson said of the system. \"I believe it was installed very well and covered all areas of Mr. Bieber's house. His security system was well operated.\" A dozen deputies, armed with a search warrant from a judge, seized the hard drives that hold the security video from last week. Detectives are scouring the video frame-by-frame for clues as to who tossed eggs from Bieber's property onto the house next door in the exclusive Calabasas, California, community last Thursday night, Thompson said. \"It will either prove or disprove, or maybe neither.\" If video from that night is missing, detectives will call for help, he said. \"We have a high-tech crew that works on such things, depending on what we find they can tell if it's been deleted, altered or stopped at a certain time or turned off,\" Thompson said. \"If it's 24-hour security video and it doesn't show a particular day, you can make your own conclusions.\" While the neighbor who accused Bieber of launching the egg assault does not have a similar video system, TMZ did obtain video of the incident recorded by the accuser. While the attackers can't be seen, they are heard. Detectives could use test that audio to determine whether there's a match to Bieber's voice. Bieber and his representatives have stayed silent about the incident, declining to comment when contacted by CNN.

Since then, warplanes from Western and regional members of the coalition have flown hundreds of missions against ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. While the United States has contributed the bulk of the military might, some 60 nations in all have participated in some way, according to the U.S. State Department. On Monday, Egypt sent fighters to Libya to bomb ISIS positions after the execution of 20 Egyptian Christians. \"Everybody in this coalition contributes what they can, and we're grateful for all of that,\" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said in February. Here's a look at the contributions of some of the nations involved in the coalition: . Australia: Australia has participated in airstrikes and humanitarian missions in Iraq, and has sent special forces and other troops to help train Iraqi security forces in first aid, explosive hazards, urban combat and working dog programs, according to the defense ministry. As of February 12, Australian aircraft had carried out about 13% of all coalition airstrikes, Vice Adm. David Johnston told reporters. Bahrain: The oil-wealthy Gulf nation east of Saudi Arabia was part of the first handful of nations that participated in airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria. Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed al Khalifa, speaking on CNN in September, called ISIS a \"deviated cult\" that must be fought. On Sunday, Bahrain announced it was sending aircraft to Jordan to participate in anti-ISIS efforts. Bahrain has had close relations with the United States for years, and the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet is in based in Bahrain. Belgium: The country has conducted airstrikes against ISIS targets, according to U.S. Central Command.

It's either \"What's it like to be a female sports writer?\" or \"Do you go in the locker room?\" The first one is tricky to answer. The second one is not: \"Yes, and it stinks.\" Locker rooms are smelly places. They are dank. They are damp. They are really not fun places to be inside. But you know what? That's where the athletes and coaches who I need to interview are, and so, that's where I am going to be.

My job has taken me inside pro sports locker rooms off and on for the past dozen years or so. While the arrival of the NBA in Oklahoma City several years has increased the frequency with which I'm inside locker rooms, I still remember the first time that I went into a pro sports locker room. My employer, The Oklahoman, sent me to Arlington, Texas, to cover a Rangers game. With Oklahoma City being only three hours away from the Dallas-Fort Worth area, we have lots of readers who are Rangers fans. They were in playoff contention, and they were hosting a weekend series with the Red Sox. I had lots of stories to write and interviews to do, so I had to get there early for the open locker-room period before the game. As I took the elevator down from the press box to the field level, my mind was racing about all the players I needed to interview. But it was also spinning because I wasn't sure what to expect in the locker room. It wasn't the first time I'd been in a locker room to do interviews, but it was the first time I'd been inside a pro locker room. Would it be any different? Would it be hostile? Would it be weird?

The family of elephants were killed on Saturday in Tsavo East National Park in southern Kenya, according to a statement Monday from the Kenya Wildlife Service.

Teams of rangers on foot and in the air are trying to track down the poachers in the 22,000-square-kilometer (8,500-square-mile) park, the country's largest single ecosystem, according to the wildlife service. It said it believed around 10 poachers were involved. The killing follows warnings last year from conservation groups that elephants were being slaughtered in Africa at an alarming rate to feed demand for ivory from increasingly affluent Asian countries, particularly China and Thailand. At the same time, the groups said, poachers are becoming more heavily armed, making it harder for often ill-equipped park wardens to protect the animals.

But the Qataris powerful sovereign wealth fund did not pay any stamp duty on the purchase after employing complex tax avoidance methods. Scroll down for video . The Qatari ruling family has been ordered to pay \u00a338million in stamp duty for the purchase of Chelsea Barracks after using an aggressive tax avoidance scheme to avoid the bill . The country\u2019s investment arm sold the land to its own bank and then leased it back, exploiting a tax break called sub-sale tax relief, the taxman said. The loophole enables buyers to avoid paying stamp duty on a property they are buying by transferring it to a trust at the same time as they complete the sale. In doing so, HM Revenue and Customs said \u2018they attempted to eliminate all of the stamp duty land tax due on the purchase of the barracks\u2019. The Qataris claimed they had done this for commercial purposes, and not to avoid tax, but their argument was yesterday rejected by the courts. The upper tribunal upheld a previous legal ruling which found the Qataris had unfairly side-stepped the tax.

            "Washington (CNN) -- Come the first Tuesday in November, when millions are streaming into polling stations across the country, as much as 40% of Americans will have already voted. In 2004, 22% of Americans voted early and that rate rose to 34% in 2008, according to Paul Gronke, Professor of Political Science who founded and runs the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College in Oregon. Not only is early voting changing the way Americans cast their ballot but it's also changing the way candidates run their campaigns. \"People find it much easier if they can choose the time to vote ... rather than show up on one day of the week,\" said Tom Slockett, Johnson County, Iowa, commissioner of elections and the county's voting auditor. Slockett said early voting is insurance against the expected -- finals at the University of Iowa or an out-of-town business trip -- or the unexpected, like a sick child. Johnson County, home to 130,000 residents, is on pace with its 2008 early voting requests by mail when about 55% of the county voted early. Iowa begins early voting on September 27, almost a week before the first debate on October 3. Idaho and South Dakota are the first states to start voting with ballots being cast on Friday. Depending on state law, early voting can either be done in-person, through the mail or through an absentee ballot. Some states require an excuse for absentee voting while others are moving toward no-excuse absentee balloting. Military personnel are able to vote by email. While early voting has changed the times when voters hit the polls, it has also changed the cycle by which campaigns try to influence voters. Voting days are upon us . The October Surprise -- \"the really stinky piece of information that campaigns hold on to until the end of the election,\" as Michael McDonald, an associate professor at George Mason University who specializes in American elections, puts it -- will have to be a September Surprise to have much effect.

        "Extract key points from the article based on which the stock market could react:\n\n(CNN) -- Homeland security officials on Wednesday abruptly shelved a proposal to build a national database of license-plate scans after criticism from privacy advocates. The proposal, which had been posted online last week by the office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, sought a contractor who could establish a searchable database of license plates, with the times and locations where they were spotted by traffic cameras and other sources. But in a statement late Wednesday, the department announced a reversal. \"The solicitation, which was posted without the awareness of ICE leadership, has been canceled,\" said spokeswoman Gillian Christensen. \"While we continue to support a range of technologies to help meet our law enforcement mission, this solicitation will be reviewed to ensure the path forward appropriately meets our operational needs.\" It was unclear whether the proposal was dead or was merely withdrawn for revisions. Under the proposal, officers in the field would have been able to use their smartphones to look up a license plate and see every time and every place the vehicle had been spotted by a camera. \"The database should track vehicle license plate numbers that pass through cameras or are voluntarily entered into the system from a variety of sources (access control systems, asset recovery specialists, etc.) and uploaded to share with law enforcement,\" the original solicitation read. The proposed National License Plate Recognition database was to have been used by immigration officers to find and arrest fugitives. Supporters of license-plate scanning, like former New York state homeland security chief Michael Balboni, said it could have been an invaluable tool for finding dangerous suspects. \"What license-plate readers have been used for most effectively is (trying) to do hits against outstanding warrants, against unlicensed drivers, against folks who have shown before that they've been involved in some kind of crime -- that's where the hits come.\" But since the solicitation was posted and...",

        "Sum the following article in brief: Boss Neil Warnock would welcome a Crystal Palace takeover, but admits he is facing deja vu. The Eagles drew 2-2 at West Brom on Saturday, having led 2-0, after reports linking American billionaire Josh Harris with the club emerged. Harris is worth more than \u00a31.25billion, according to the Forbes guide, and owns NBA franchise the Philadelphia 76ers and NHL side the New Jersey Devils. Warnock was in charge at Leeds and QPR when they were sold, and knows the feeling after Palace were linked with a takeover. Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock was at Leeds and QPR when they were taken over . 'Yes, because it's happened many times,' he said. 'At Leeds it happened, at QPR there was a takeover and now Palace. 'But it is difficult for managers now. Every club would love a billionaire. There are not that many about - you have to snap their hand off. 'It must be lovely, but it brings a different kind of pressure, to be able to spend millions and get top players. 'It must be brilliant for any manager to spend millions and get to work with players like (Chelsea's Diego) Costa.

Palace were 2-0 up at the break at The Hawthorns after Brede Hangeland's opener and Mile Jedinak's penalty. Victor Anichebe made it 2-1 in the second half after Craig Dawson barged into Julian Speroni, leaving Warnock baffled as to why referee Mark Clattenburg did not award a foul. It forced the goalkeeper off with a head injury and Clattenburg also failed to give Palace another first -half penalty when Dawson felled Wilfried Zaha. Palace went ahead through Brede Hangeland and then\u00a0Mile Jedinak put them 2-0 up but West Brom pegged them back . Saido Berahino's stoppage-time spot-kick salvaged a point for the...",

Before teams sink that much money into players, they have questions. With the revelation that the football feel-good story of the year centered on the Notre Dame linebacker's love for a woman who never existed, many people have questions for Te'o -- a lot of questions. And as each question in the saga gets answered -- none publicly by Te'o --- it seems another one, or two, or three, crop up. For instance, why did Te'o tell reporters before the Heisman Trophy presentation on December 8 that he \"lost both my grandparents and my girlfriend to cancer,\" when two days earlier the woman he thought was dead called him on his cellphone? Why did he tell a Sports Illustrated reporter in October that Kekua came to one of his games then issue a statement this week that he never met her? Who is now behind the one of the Twitter accounts associated with Lennay Kekua, a woman who apparently never lived, let alone died, in September before Te'o, who called her his girlfriend, played one of the biggest games of the young season? The Te'o hoax in 30 posts . A tweet Thursday purportedly from the fictional girlfriend promised she would have a big announcement that would help sort out details of the story, but the tweet was merely a joke about Te'o. Two other tweets on the page were retweets from the verified account of Te'o. \"@LennayKay I miss you!\" a November 6 tweet from Te'o said. On September 12, Te'o tweeted \"@LennayKay you will always be with me wherever I go!\" It was unclear Thursday whether the person Te'o tweeted to in September used it again after reports broke of a hoax or whether someone created a new account with the same user name. The airing of the bizarre story began Wednesday, when sports website Deadspin published a piece dismissing as a hoax the existence of Te'o's girlfriend -- the one who he said died around the same time as his grandmother while his team marched toward the BCS...",

            "Oakland, California (CNN) -- A former police officer convicted of involuntary manslaughter for killing an unarmed man in Oakland, California, apologized to the public and described his memories of the moments after the shooting in a handwritten letter obtained by CNN. In the letter, Johannes Mehserle said he was \"truly sorry\" for killing Oscar Grant. \"For now, and forever, I will live, breathe, sleep, and not sleep with the memory of Mr. Grant screaming 'you shot me' and me putting my hands on the bullet wound thinking the pressure would help while I kept telling him 'you'll be okay,'\" Mehserle says in the letter. \"I tried to tell myself that maybe this shot would not be so serious, but I recall how sick I felt when Mr. Grant stopped talking, closed his eyes and seemed to change his breathing.\" Mehserle's letter was dated July 4, four days before a jury found him guilty of involuntary manslaughter for shooting 22-year-old Grant on an Oakland train platform on January 1, 2009. Mehserle, who was on duty as a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer at the time of the incident, said at the trial that he intended to draw and fire his Taser rather than his gun, CNN affiliate KTVU reported. \"I have and will continue to live everyday of my life knowing that Mr. Grant should not have been shot,\" his letter said. \"No words can express how truly sorry I am.\" The involuntary manslaughter conviction usually carries a maximum four-year sentence, but some in Oakland expected a tougher penalty for the former police officer, and took to the streets in protest Thursday. Crowds broke the glass of a Foot Locker and other stores. Others threw sneakers out of the store as police wearing gas masks stormed the area. Outside the courtroom, Grant family members expressed outrage at the verdict. \"My son was murdered. He was murdered. He was murdered.

You may already know that to make his movie adaptation of the internationally popular theatrical musical conjured from the 19th-century political novel by Victor Hugo, director Tom Hooper (\"The King's Speech\") bade his actors sing live during filming. You probably already know that Anne Hathaway, as the wretched single mother-turned-prostitute Fantine, is reputedly a formidable Oscar favorite for her sobbing and warbling and haircutting-in-real-time. You've learned, from posters and trailers, that Hugh Jackman, as former convict Jean Valjean, looks impressively stricken and that Russell Crowe, as implacable police inspector Javert, looks disconcertingly dyspeptic. What's left to learn is this: \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" provides compelling reasons for Crowe to be peeved, beginning with the humiliation of having to sing Broadway-style, when it clearly is so not his thing, and ending with the Cap'n Crunch wardrobe into which the gentleman is packed. (O, for Crowe's costumed glory days in \"Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World!\") Jackman has a right to be cranky too, although he's too much of a trouper to show it as he overemotes on demand and sings of finding God after he steals a pair of candlesticks from a nice priest. (Long story.) Hathaway looks happy enough channeling Liza Minnelli for her tremulous rendition of the Susan Boyle-appropriated anthem ''I Dreamed a Dream,'' but that's no doubt because she knows that soon after the song, she's pretty much done for the night.

The visitors, who would have moved a point clear of Real Madrid with victory in Alicante, hit the post early on through Brazilian striker Nilmar but fell behind in the 26th minute when Paraguay striker Valdez scored following Royston Drenthe's free-kick. Spain full-back Joan Capdevila equalized from close range three minutes later following a low Angel Lopez cross, then teammate Giuseppe Rossi hit the post. However, Trezeguet pounced to net his fourth league goal since arriving from Juventus when Villarreal could not clear Drenthe's right-wing cross, but the 33-year-old former France star was dismissed for two quickfire yellow cards for dissent after Valero fouled Valdez. Villarreal made their extra man pay off just after the hour mark when Valero drilled in a right-foot low shot after home goalkeeper Jose Calatayud blocked efforts from Nilmar  and Rossi. Villarreal wasted several more chances before losing Valero in the 81st minute when the on-loan midfielder was booked for handball, then three minutes later Musacchio brought down Drenthe with the Argentine ruled to be the last line of defense.

At least six Thai soldiers and one civilian have been killed in the clashes that started last week. Cambodia has said three of its troops have been killed in the fighting.

The source, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak publicly, had said if peace persisted, higher-ranking commanders might meet on Friday. The commanders would be Thailand's 2nd Region commander, Lt. Gen Tawatchai Samutsakorn, and Lt. Gen. Chea Mon, Cambodia's 5th Army Region commander. Cambodia's government spokesman could not be reached for comment. Clashes between the two started April 22 as both sides accused each other of trying to seize ancient temples.

            "Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Hezbollah's leader plans to speak Saturday about the indictment of four party members in the assassination six years ago of Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's former prime minister. The group's press office said Hassan Nasrallah plans to make remarks about the U.N.-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which issued indictments and arrest warrants this week in the February 14, 2005 killing of Rafik Hariri and 22 others. Hezbollah is a Shiite political faction in Lebanon that provides social services to its constituents, but it has long been regarded as a terrorist organization by the United States and as an ally of Iran. It has had longstanding animosity toward the tribunal, based on the expectation that some of its members would be indicted as conspirators in Hariri's assassination, and Nasrallah has accused the group's arch-enemy Israel of the assassination. The tribunal submitted to Lebanese authorities a sealed indictment and arrest warrants for an unknown number of suspects. A highly-placed source in the Lebanese Army told CNN the four include Mustafa Badreddine, Hasan Oneisa, Salim Ayyah and Asad Sabra -- all Hezbollah members. Badreddine -- who is the brother-in-law of Imad Mughniyeh, a former Hezbollah commander who was assassinated in Syria in 2008 -- is reported to be a member of Hezbollah's advisory council. A U.N. source familiar with the tribunal said the people indicted include alleged perpetrators on the ground. Two additional lists of indictments are expected later this summer and are expected to include the organizers and planners of the attack, the U.N. source said. An indictment had been submitted in January and was then amended three times. Daniel Fransen, a pre-trial judge with the tribunal, \"ruled that the indictment shall remain confidential to help Lebanese authorities in fulfilling their obligations to arrest the accused,\" the tribunal said. It won't comment on the identity anyone named in the indictment. Authorities in Lebanon will have to report to the tribunal within 30..."

        "In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?\n\nArticle: (CNN) -- The Pentagon has revolutionized warfare during the past decade, making unmanned aerial vehicles, known as UAVs, a staple of modern combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. A USAF technician at Creech Air Force Base, checks Hellfire missile attachments on a Predator. Remotely-controlled drones, such as the Predator and the Reaper, have allowed the U.S. military to spy on and attack enemy combatants without putting their own forces at risk, thereby making UAVs a must-have. \"The real advantage of unmanned aerial systems is they allow you to project power without projecting vulnerability,\" says USAF Lt. Gen. David Deptula at the Pentagon.   But as USAF commanders try to provide enough pilots to take charge of drones, many are considering another aspect of the warfare revolution -- the psychological impact on those controlling the vehicles. As Dr. Kory Cornum, a USAF colonel, explains: \"Whereas we have thousands of years of data on what it's like to go to war really, we only have a few years of data on what it's like to go to war virtually.

UPDATED: . 11:42 EST, 23 August 2012 . Rafael Correa says the UK has no right to criticise Ecuador . Ecuador's President Rafael Correa says Britain is not in a position to preach about its decision to offer asylum to Julian Assange when it failed to extradite former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet. Correa has infuriated British officials by offering protection at the Ecuador embassy in London to the Wikileaks founder who is wanted for sex assault and rape allegations in Sweden. The South American nation's socialist leader says he shares the former computer hacker's fears that he could be sent from Sweden to the U.S. to face charges over WikiLeak's publication in 2010 of thousands of secret U.S. cables. Both U.S. and European government sources say no criminal charges against Assange have been issued by the U.S. and that Washington has launched no attempt to extradite him. Britain says it is determined to fulfill a legal obligation to send Assange to Sweden. But Correa said London had made its own rules in the past - specifically, by not extraditing Pinochet, who was charged with multiple human rights violations. 'Pinochet was not extradited for humanitarian reasons, when there were dozens of Europeans and thousands of Latin Americans who were murdered, and tens of thousands of people were tortured during the Pinochet dictatorship,' he told reporters in the country's capital Quito. Pinochet was arrested by British police at a hospital in London in 1998 after Spain demanded his extradition for alleged torture and murder, including of Spanish citizens, during his 1973-1990 rule. The British government decided in 2000 that the frail Pinochet was unfit to stand trial and free to fly home. He died six years later in Santiago, Chile, aged 91. 'If Pinochet was not extradited for humanitarian reasons then it's clear that they can take the decision not to extradite Mr. Julian Assange,' Correa said.

Joshua French and Tjostolv Moland have been sentenced to death and have five days to appeal. Asked about the sentence, Lambert Mende Omalanga, Congo's minister of communications, told CNN, \"We don't have a habit of commenting on judicial decisions.\" However, Omalanga said, his country has not carried out the death penalty in 10 years. He said lawmakers in parliament are in the process of trying to take the law off the books. A military court in Kisangani found Tjostolv Moland, 28, and Joshua French, 27, guilty on all charges, Norwegian TV2 reported. The court also ordered the pair to pay $60 million in damages. The men have five days to appeal their sentence, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN. It was not clear why the men were in Congo. \"I have earlier made absolutely clear that these two have not been conducting business for Norway in any shape or form,\" Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr Store told Norwegian state television NRK after the verdict. \"We will now read through the sentence to see exactly how it is written,\" Store added. Norwegian authorities have been following the trial closely on television, and have tried to keep a balance between respecting the judicial system of a different country and helping Norwegian citizens in trouble, Store told NRK. The two men were found guilty of spying for Norway and for killing a driver in May, according to NRK. In an earlier statement on the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Web site, the ministry said that if the two Norwegians were to receive the death penalty, Norwegian authorities would immediately try to seek assurances from Congolese authorities that the death sentence would not be carried out. \"Norway has a very strong stand on the death penalty, and we are very much against it,\" a Ministry of Foreign Affairs...",

        [
            "(CNN) -- It's Valentine's Day, and the Olympic village is in the mood -- at least that's the story according to one champion athlete at this month's Games. Slopestyle gold medalist Jamie Anderson revealed she had to delete her account with online dating app Tinder before her snowboard event in order to focus on the Olympics. \"Tinder in the Olympic Village is next level,\" the 23-year-old from South Lake Tahoe, California said in an interview with the magazine U.S. Weekly published Wednesday. \"It's all athletes! In the mountain village it's all athletes. It's hilarious. There are some cuties on there. \"There was a point where I had to be like OK, this is way too distracting. I deleted my account to focus on the Olympics.\" Tinder is a matchmaking app for smartphones that facilitates communication between nearby users, prompting them to decide whether they like each other on the basis of a photograph and a brief profile. If two users select \"like\" for one another, the match is made known to both individuals and they can begin messaging. With most athletes owning smartphones and being active on social media, it was perhaps inevitable that the increasingly popular Tinder would play Cupid at the Olympics. In fact, the company has experienced a 400% day-over-day increase of new users in Sochi since the Games began last Friday, Tinder CEO and founder Sean Rad told the Wall Street Journal. With almost 3,000 competitors staying in the Olympic Village alone, and that doesn't include support staff, officials, media and fans who are all staying nearby. This diverse mix of people from all corners of the globe, for what is essentially one big party over a three-week period, is perhaps why organizers have seen fit to supply roughly 100,000 condoms to the Olympic village. \"I haven't seen it in action but I've definitely heard the athletes' village is a melting pot of good-looking people at the top of their sport,\" U.S. snowboarder Alex Diebold told reporters. \"They do provide free condoms, which I think is a really smart move..."

        "In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?\n\nArticle: By . Associated Press . FBI agents and other law enforcement officials will now be able to record interviews with suspects after the Justice Department overturned a longstanding policy. The new policy, laid out in a memo issued this week by Deputy Attorney General James Cole, establishes a 'presumption' that agents will record interviews with suspects who have been taken into custody but have not yet appeared in court. The policy, which is to take effect July 11, covers the FBI as well as the Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Marshals Service. More evidence: The reversal will allow agents to use the information they collect in interviews as proof in subsequent trials . That new standard replaces current practice, in which agents interview suspects without recording them, take handwritten notes and then produce a report summarizing the conversation. It addresses concerns from civil rights groups and defense lawyers who say the absence of recordings leaves too many ambiguities as to what precisely was said and whether agents' accounts are fully reliable. The policy is also intended to ensure that law enforcement has a clear record of any confession or critical statement, and that interviews with suspects are properly done. 'I think it is a tremendous step forward by the department in recognizing that having an accurate record of what is said in the custodial interrogation is helpful, both to the government and to the defense,' said Barry Pollack, a criminal defense lawyer in Washington. Decision maker: The reversal was laid out in a memo issued this week by Deputy Attorney General James Cole . He said one of the leading causes for false confessions is not having an accurate understanding of the context in which the statement was made . Still, he noted, the change is narrow in scope since it applies only to interviews with suspects who have already been arrested or are in custody. The policy change allows for some exceptions, including if the...",

These items, stored by FEMA, were meant for Katrina victims but were given to state and federal agencies. The material, from basic kitchen goods to sleeping necessities, sat in warehouses for two years before the Federal Emergency Management Agency's giveaway to federal and state agencies this year. James McIntyre, FEMA's acting press secretary, said that FEMA was spending more than $1 million a year to store the material and that another agency wanted the warehouses torn down, so \"we needed to vacate them.\" \"Upon review of our assets and our need to continue to store them, we determined that they were excess to FEMA's needs; therefore, they are being excessed from FEMA's inventory,\" McIntyre wrote in an e-mail. He declined a request for an on-camera interview, telling CNN the giveaway was \"not news.\" Photos from one of the facilities in Fort Worth, Texas, show pallet after pallet of cots, cleansers, first-aid kits, coffee makers, camp stoves and other items stacked to the ceiling.

Martha Kegel, the head of a New Orleans nonprofit agency that helps find homes for those still displaced by the storm, said she was shocked to learn about the existence of the goods and the government giveaway. \"These are exactly the items that we are desperately seeking donations of right now: basic kitchen household supplies,\" said Kegel, executive director of Unity of Greater New Orleans. \"These are the very things that we are seeking right now.

            "(CNN) -- Four months after he was escorted in his pajamas onto a military plane and flown out of the country, ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya could return to power within days, analysts said Friday. Negotiators for Zelaya and Roberto Micheletti, the politician who was appointed president hours after Zelaya's June 28 removal, reached an agreement late Thursday to form a government of national reconciliation. The nation's congress, in consultation with the supreme court, must approve Zelaya's return to power. The reconciliation government would rule until a new president, to be chosen in November 29 elections, takes office in January. Micheletti announced the agreement in a televised speech to the nation Thursday night. Zelaya said Friday his return to the presidency is \"imminent\" and should occur within days. He has been staying at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, since secretly returning to the country September 21. \"At this moment we are trying to reach a consensus so we can reconstruct democracy,\" he told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol on Friday.

            "(CNN) -- The United States and China put on sharp display Thursday their continuing differences over territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas, disputes that are now boiling over into violence. In a joint news conference at the Pentagon, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey and his Chinese counterpart, Gen. Fang Fenghui, described their private discussions as \"refreshingly frank\" and \"constructive\" before expressing opposing views of who is to blame for the broadening tensions. China and Vietnam are currently locked in a standoff after China installed an oil rig on an island in the Paracel chain (jointly claimed by the two countries), sparking protests in Vietnam, including violent attacks on Chinese and ethnic Chinese residents. Fang said, \"We do not make trouble but we are not afraid of trouble,\" adding \"in matters of territory, our attitude is firm. We won't give an inch.\" Dempsey countered, \"We have to acknowledge there are territorial disputes,\" including \"what exactly is the status quo and who is seeking to change it.\" It was a veiled reference to Washington's position that Beijing is attempting to change the status quo by more aggressively seeking to establish control over numerous island chains simultaneously claimed by China and several South East Asia nations. In addition to the current standoff between China and Vietnam, China and Japan both claim sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands, while China and the Philippines are competing for control over several small land formations, such as the Scarborough Shoal. On his recent trip to Asia, President Barack Obama announced a new military base access agreement with the Philippines. The United States says it takes no position on sovereignty but encourages all sides to resolve the disputes through diplomacy.

Kitterman was a 60-year-old Texan who owned Peregrine Eyes, a construction company that was building a helipad at the U.S. Consulate, according to the FBI. He was last seen alive on the evening of May 21, 2009, inside the Green Zone, a high-security district. Local security guards reported seeing Kitterman's car leave the compound at 11 p.m. that night. His body was found the next day in the Green Zone. Andrew Ames, a spokesman for the FBI, said Friday that \"the manner in which the murder was carried out has not been released.\" CNN reported in June 2009 that Kitterman was found bound, blindfolded and fatally stabbed. His now-defunct company had about 45 employees that were primarily from the United States and Philippines, the FBI said. The agency has distributed posters in Arabic and Tagalog announcing the award money for any information leading to the arrest of those responsible, because it believes a former employee may have some clues. \"The investigation itself has included hundreds of interviews during the past five years with potential witnesses in the U.S., Iraq, Afghanistan and the Philippines, but despite that we still need the public's help,\" the FBI said. The reward is for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the death, the agency said.",

And this one -- published, then pulled, by Clorox -- charts new terrain in depicting first-time fathers as clueless buffoons. \"Saying 'No-no' is not just for baby.

Somehow, it manages to get even more offensive from there.

He lets baby eat off the floor -- so, the web post cautions, \"At least get him to enforce a 5-second rule.\" He fails to notice the food -- or, worse, Play-Doh -- all over his baby's face, let alone wipe it off. Then he gives his child inappropriate screen time, plopping the baby down in front of \"reality shows.\" Parental outcry led Clorox to reexamine the wisdom of the post.

Saturday marked 2,024 days since he's been gone. \"Every day I miss him,\" said Christine Levinson, his wife of 38 years. \"I wake up and his side of the bed is empty.\" She left her Florida home this week to travel to New York in hopes of making a personal plea to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is attending this week's U.N. General Assembly. Levinson is convinced Ahmadinejad can help in the search for her husband. \"In the past he has said that he will investigate and he will have his people investigate,\" Levinson told CNN. \"He has promised to help us. So we need to get him in touch with whoever can help us get the job done and get Bob home.\" Feds still hunting for missing FBI agent who vanished in Iran . The Levinson family says Robert was working as a private investigator looking into cigarette smuggling in Iran when he went missing. The State Department has repeatedly denied he was working for the government and has urged Tehran to find him. Last year, the Iranian government said it would make inquiries about Levinson but did not know what happened to him.

        "Condense the article down to the essentials to present it in the form of short cards in mobile news apps:\n\nWoods Hole, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Our need for oil almost wiped out the sperm whale once, and now our insatiable hunger for it threatens them again. Sperm whales were hunted in the Gulf of Mexico in the 18th and 19th centuries for their oil, but were somewhat spared when petroleum replaced whale oil as an energy source. Now, instead of hunters, the same oil that helped to save the sperm whales from extinction threatens their survival in the Gulf. Sperm whales, listed as endangered in 1970, are social animals. The young live with their mothers for years in stable groups, and the whales dive deep in search of food. Because they spend so much of their lives undersea, our knowledge of their behavior and community structure is limited. We have a lot to learn before we can say we truly know these animals. We do know that sperm whales depend on the deep ocean habitat. And we know that habitat in the Gulf is severely threatened by the disastrous BP oil spill -- particularly as the oil spreads through plumes that go deep into the water. [On Tuesday, the decomposed body of a juvenile sperm whale was found 77 miles from the well, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Investigators are trying to determine whether oil played a role in its death; it was not found in oiled water.] . Routinely holding their breath for about 45 minutes, sperm whales can dive half a mile to hunt fish and squid. When they arrive at the surface, they spend about nine minutes breathing and preparing for their next dive. About 1,665 sperm whales live in the Gulf of Mexico, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service, and reports say about 300 to 400 of them depend on deep waters near the mouth of the Mississippi River. Whalers, centuries ago, found that the Mississippi Canyon, off the Mississippi River Delta, was a hot spot for sperm whales. A recent review of whalers' logbooks shows that from 1788 to 1877, about 204 voyages spent at least one season whaling in the Gulf. Recent research indicates about 40 whales...",

        "Extract key points from the article based on which the stock market could react:\n\n(CNN) -- Friday's weak jobs report is more than a disappointing blip. It is a glimpse ahead of our disappointing future. Nearly three years from the beginning of the economic recovery in the summer of 2009, the U.S. economy has replaced not even half the jobs lost in the slump of 2007-2009. At the current pace of job creation, it will take until 2017 to replace all the jobs lost. But of course the population has grown since 2007, so \"replacement\" is not good enough. We are even further away from equaling the employment rate of 2007 -- the proportion of the working-age population at work. Even when (or if) full job recovery does come, it will not restore the economy of 2007 just as it was. Recessions reshape economies. The best book written about the social effects of the Great Recession is Don Peck's \"Pinched.\" Peck shows us a new world emerging from the catastrophe of 2008, a new world that most Americans will find harsher than the old. For example: Despite the long, slow relative decline of manufacturing as a source of American jobs, the total number of manufacturing jobs in the United States had remained constant at about 18 million for decades. Between 2007 and 2009, the number of manufacturing jobs dropped by 6 million. While manufacturing is beginning a recovery now, it seems impossible that the sector will regenerate to anything like its former extent. The new jobs being added to the U.S. economy pay less, on average, than the jobs lost -- which is why the average rate of pay in the United States remains stagnant or even drops as the number of jobs slowly grows. At the top of the economic heap, recovery has been more complete. The richest Americans suffered sharp shocks to their wealth when markets collapsed in 2008-2009. As financial markets have revived, so has the wealth of the top 1% (households earning more than $380,000 per year.) The top 5% have done OK, too. (The top 5% begins a little south of $200,000 in household income.) For most of the country, however, the outlook is -- to borrow Peck's...",

Abdullah Ibrahim el-Faisal was deported to the West African country of Gambia, Kenyan Immigration Minister Otieno Kajwang told reporters in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. Kenyan anti-terror police picked up Abdullah Ibrahim el-Faisal days ago after he passed into the country unnoticed, police spokesman Eric Kiraithe told CNN on Tuesday. Kenya's immigration minister declared him an unwanted person in Kenya, Kiraithe said, adding that el-Faisal is a threat to Kenya's security with \"proven\" terrorism links. El-Faisal was sentenced in London to nine years in prison in March 2003 for inciting others to commit murder and for stirring racial hatred. He had been arrested a year earlier. He was paroled in 2007 after serving half his sentence and deported to Jamaica, according to British news reports. El-Faisal entered Kenya from Tanzania, Kiraithe said, but it was not clear when. Kiraithe acknowledged there had been \"lapses\" between Kenya's police and immigration that allowed the cleric to enter the country. Kenyan Muslim groups have protested the moves to deport el-Faisal. \"He is being treated unfairly,\" said Al-Amin Kimathi, the executive coordinator for the Muslim Forum of Human Rights, \"He has committed no crimes in Jamaica and has not committed any crimes in Kenya. There is a double standard at work.\" Before his sentence in Britain, el-Faisal had spent much of the previous decade preaching in various mosques and selling audiotapes across the country. In one of the tapes, he said, \"How do you fight the Hindus? You have to bomb the Indian businesses. And as for the Jews, you kill them physically. Then you will overcome them in Kashmir and in Palestine.\" His lawyers in Britain had asked the judge in his case to consider the Muslim convert \"misguided rather than malicious.\" The defense stressed that most of his preachings were benign...",

Four lists have already been compiled but have been kept secret because the alleged perpetrators should be given due process, said Vitit Muntarbhorn, a member of the U.N. commission of inquiry on Syria.  A new list would consolidate the first four, he said. \"We are also considering today, this month and next month, the pros and cons of whether or not to release the list,\" he said. The announcement came as the commission released its ninth report on the situation in Syria, where a civil war has intensified and become more bloody since beginning in 2011. More than 200,000 civilians have been killed during the conflict and millions of people have fled to neighboring countries. Many other people have been tortured or raped. And concern is building because children are now being turned into executioners. In their report, the four commissioners said: \"Missed humanitarian opportunities have been aggravated by the exponential rise in the perpetration of war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights violations.\" The commissioners recommended that justice be administered through the International Criminal Court or an ad hoc international tribunal. To set up a tribunal would take the approval of the U.N. Security Council, said Mark Lyall Grant, the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United Nations. The commission may release the list of alleged war criminals at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on March 17. The list would name members of the Syrian military, rebel groups and ISIS. CNN's Richard Roth contributed to this report.",

His goal is not only to jump from a higher altitude than anyone ever has -- 120,000 feet, more than three times the cruising altitude of the average airliner. He also hopes to be the first person to break the sound barrier, without the aid of anything besides the space suit. At that altitude, the thin air provides so little resistance that after just 40 seconds, he is expected to be free-falling faster than 690 miles an hour. \"I'm not nuts,\" Baumgartner said when CNN first interviewed him about the project in 2010. \"You know, our records are meant to be broken, and I'm a very competitive person. I like the challenge.\" 'Human helicopter' breaks record for world's longest flight . But on a more serious note, he added, \"Of course I'm afraid of dying, because I worked so hard to reach this level. You know, I'm living a good life. I think the most important thing I'm doing is to come back alive.\" After years of preparations and untold costs to his primary sponsor Red Bull, the jump is scheduled for Tuesday morning at dawn. Baumgartner expects to spend two or three hours on the ascent, in a capsule hanging from a helium balloon. Then he will climb out of his capsule, jump off the step with a bunny hop and form a crouched \"delta\" position to maximize his speed. He plans to fall 115,000 feet in less than five minutes, before deploying a parachute for the final 5,000 feet to earth. The attempt has serious risks. He and his team have practiced how he can avoid getting trapped in a dangerous \"horizontal spin.\" And at temperatures that could hit 70 degrees below zero Fahrenheit or lower, and an atmosphere so thin that his blood would vaporize if he were unprotected, his life will depend on the integrity of his pressure suit.

This is particularly true at the Paris Airshow (which starts Monday and runs till Friday), where Airbus always makes a special push to win the headlines war. Airbus, of course, is headquartered in Toulouse, France, an hour's flight south of Paris. Government pressure . Aside from the aggressive competitiveness of Airbus Chief Operating Officer John Leahy, who can't tolerate being second at any time and who rarely misses any opportunity to tweak Boeing, the French government is also known to pressure Airbus to make a great showing. Boeing conceded the point long ago. \"We know Airbus sees this as a competition on their home turf. In terms of orders, we see this as one week out of 52,\" admits Boeing's Vice President of Marketing Randy Tinseth, the company's most visible communications counterpart to Leahy. (Leahy's actual counterpart, Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing Commercial Aircraft, tends to keep a low profile.) \"Despite the wave of orders our competition rolls out at airshows, the market has still been roughly split down the middle over the past decade,\" says Tinseth.

But what if your job involves large amounts of travel? Many people come back from trips away carrying extra pounds from disruption to regular exercise, as well as an increased tendency to overindulge on business dinners paid for on the company card. According to the World Health Organisation, lack of exercise not only impairs your waistline, but can also reduce energy and concentration levels -- the exact qualities that are required when conducting business abroad. Shani Anderson is a personal trainer and managing director of Anderson Fitness Consultants. The British former Olympian says that with the right foresight, it's possible to incorporate a healthy regime wherever and however you travel. 1) Don't treat business travel as a \"holiday\" from your health regime . There's a temptation to regard exercise as a means to looking good on holiday, rather than as an ongoing strategy for health and well-being. \"A lot of people diet or work out to go on holiday. And for me that's a problem, because you have short-term goals,\" says Anderson. \"You switch off when you reach the goal, and your body goes 'great, I'm done' - and in two weeks you're back the way you were before.\" According to Anderson, this exemplifies the most common obstacle to keeping fit while traveling: Attitude. People tend to perceive trips away from home as in some way separate from the rest of their lives and that therefore the same rules no longer apply. 2) Prepare and do research . Before you travel, investigate the best locations for your preferred form of exercise. If you're into cycling, see if there's a local bike hire company nearby; if you're a jogger, plan the most scenic route to get the most of your new environment. Anderson's motto is \"plan, plan, plan.\" She says that a common trap during hectic business trips is failing to schedule and prioritise your adapted exercise regime before you leave. \"It should be exactly the...",

Both groups say they learned about the policy change Tuesday, and charged that the TSA is forgetting about the terrorist attacks that led to the formation of the agency. \"It's as if we didn't learn anything from 9/11,\" said George Randall Taylor, head of the air marshal unit of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA). \"Flight attendants are going to be sitting ducks.\" On Tuesday, TSA Administrator John Pistole announced that small pocketknives and an array of sporting equipment -- which were banned from aircraft cabins in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks -- will be allowed in U.S. planes beginning April 25. Former TSA chief backs 'knife' decision; suggests axes and machetes, too . Pocketknives will be allowed if the blade is no longer than 2.36 inches (6 centimeters), which is shorter than the 4-inch blades that were allowed at the time of the 2001 attacks. And they must adhere to other rules: the blade can be no more than 1/2 inch at its widest point, it cannot have a locking or fixed blade and cannot have a molded grip. Box cutters and razor blades are still not allowed inside the passenger cabin. The TSA also will allow travelers to bring billiard cues, ski poles, hockey and lacrosse sticks and a maximum of two golf clubs into aircraft cabins as carry-on baggage. It will allow novelty and toy bats if they measure less than 24 inches and plastic bats if they weigh less than 24 ounces. Some experts say security improvements since the attacks -- most notably reinforced cockpit doors, better intelligence and motivated passengers -- have made the strict prohibition of small pen-knives unnecessary.

WeChat users typing in the phrase \"civil rights\" last weekend noticed a cascade of Stars and Stripes raining down their screens, much to the chagrin of some Chinese customers, who said that no special icons appeared when patriotic Chinese terms were entered. \"When we entered words like National Day, China and the Red Flag with Five Stars, nothing happened,\" complained the Fujian provincial committee of the Communist Youth League in its official microblog Sunday night, after posting pictures of its experiments. \"WeChat, could you explain why?\" In an online statement, WeChat -- owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent -- clarified that its team had added the U.S. flag special feature in honor of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the United States on Monday and had meant for it to be seen only by users in the U.S. \"A system error had caused users in other regions to use this feature as well,\" read the statement, which also apologized for the \"misunderstanding.\" The controversy over the Stars and Stripes comes as the Chinese government -- under an increasingly powerful and ideologically conservative President Xi Jinping -- continues to tighten its grip over the cyberspace and beyond. The country's top Internet regulator has shut down 133 public WeChat accounts for \"spreading distorted historical information\" about the ruling Communist Party, state media reported Tuesday. The same agency recently told the state-controlled People's Daily newspaper that China's six major web portals deleted more than 340 million pornographic or otherwise \"harmful\" posts last year as part of the government's \"cleaning up the Internet\" campaign. Earlier this week, the Communist leadership in Beijing ordered universities nationwide to fortify ideological control by \"studying and propagating Marxism,\" as well as \"cultivating and promoting...",

Putin \"has a chance to get back into a lane of international law,\" Obama said. But for this to happen, he said, Putin must take steps over the coming weeks that include recognizing Ukraine's new President-elect Petro Poroshenko, stopping the flow of weapons over the border into Ukraine and ceasing Russian support for pro-Russia separatists in Ukraine. \"We cannot simply allow drift,\" Obama said, speaking alongside British Prime Minister David Cameron following bilateral talks. \"The mere fact that some of the Russian soldiers have moved back from the border and that Russia is now destabilizing Ukraine through surrogates, rather than overtly and explicitly, does not mean that we can afford three months, or four months, or six months, of continued violence and conflict in eastern Ukraine.\" If Russia does not de-escalate the situation, the G7 leaders are united and ready to impose further painful economic sanctions, Obama said, with consequences for the Russian people. \"Today, in contrast to a growing global economy, a sluggish Russian economy is even weaker because of the choices made by Russia's leadership,\" he said. Putin was excluded from what was originally planned as a G8 summit in Sochi, Russia, as part of measures to sanction Moscow over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. It's the first time in some 20 years that Russia has not been part of the meeting of world economic powers, Obama said, adding that the step is warranted because Moscow's actions have violated international law and gone against the group's principles.

The leak occurred Saturday at the end of a minor league hockey game between the Dells Ducks and the Ice Hawks in Lake Delton. Dozens of people were treated at local hospitals for dizziness, nausea, headaches, vomiting and fainting, authorities said. Delton Fire Department officials said the cause of the leak was the rink's resurfacing machine, CNN affiliate WISC reported. The incident started  when several players complained of headaches and dizziness. Some had vomited and one had fainted, the Delton Fire Department said in a statement. It said it recorded high readings of  the gas from inside the Poppy Waterman Ice Rink, but at the time of the leak, many hockey players, staff and spectators had left. Fire and emergency personnel went to various locations to seek out those who had attended the game and transport them to hospital, the fire department said. Activities at the ice rink were canceled for Monday. \"The good thing about this is a lot of people got sick all at once, so it was recognized quickly and the exposure was pretty limited,\" Matt Lazio, director of St. Clare's emergency department, told WISC. \"But this is a potentially fatal kind of poisoning.\"",

Collectors stopped picking up rubbish on December 21, saying that dumps are full. The garbage problem has become so bad that Neapolitan residents have started burning their waste, leading to noxious fumes permeating the air in the southern Italian coastal city. On Monday, the government called on the army to help with emergency trash collection for the second time in a year. Bags of rotting, uncollected waste now line city streets and sit in alleys beneath residential apartment blocks. In some places, the piles of trash tower over the cars driving past. Prime Minister Romano Prodi met with the interior and environment ministers in Rome after President Giorgio Napolitano, who is from Naples, said he was alarmed by the crisis. The latest problems began on December 31, when the government closed one of the area's two working dumps. Gian Francesco Raiano, a spokesman for the government's \"garbage crisis administrator,\" said the dump was closed at the request of residents. That left only one working dump, in the town of Serre, which is able to accept only 2,000 tons of trash a day. Raiano said that was the reason trash started piling up on the streets. Authorities are hoping to alleviate the problem when they reopen a long-closed dump in the town of Pianura, near Naples, by the end of this week. The government announced on December 30 that it planned to reopen Pianura, and the decision immediately sparked protests by nearby residents. They blocked roads to stop trucks from entering the site to prepare to open it after 12 years out of commission, and there were scuffles as police tried to move protesters away. Problems with Naples' garbage have been around in some form for 14 years, when Italian authorities first declared the situation an emergency. Complicating the issue is the...",

As executive director of the Kenya Land Conservation Trust and chairman of the Friends of Nairobi National Park, Kahumbu now aims to reduce people-wildlife conflicts arising from these scenarios. \"Africa is the only continent remaining on this planet that still has its full diversity of large mammals,\" she says. \"We can't afford to lose it. We've always been able to co-exist with wildlife.\" See also: Uneasy truce between Maasai and nature . In some parts of the rural Kenya however the durability of this ancient cohabitation has been tested in recent times. Lions have become a particular problem for farm owners and Maasai tribes, with whom they share the country's vast savannahs, often preying on valuable livestock. This has led many farmers and rural communities to take matters into their own hands, in some cases killing whole prides they perceive as a threat. The use of pesticides such as Furadan -- a tablespoon of which costs less than a dollar and is enough to kill a lion -- has become a particularly ruthless way of doing so. \"Kenyan lions have reduced from about 15,000 about 15 years ago to fewer than 2,000 now,\" explains Kahumbu. Read related: 'Green Nobel' fights to save Africa's rainforests . \"And we know that probably 50 percent of that is attributable directly to the use of pesticides.\" Through dialogue and education programs, Kahumbu is aiming to end these practices.

The skills he acquired playing barefoot as a child back home in rugby-mad Fiji -- where kids often use bottles because they have no ball -- earned him a place in the British Army representative side and it was not long before professional clubs took an interest.

Placing people of color within a portrait style that historically was the domain of the European elite is a political statement on inequality couched in a beautiful tableaux. Helfman's subjects in the \"Historical Correction\" series wear the same aloof expressions of 17th-century noblemen and women in portraits commissioned from artists like Frans Hals. Light plays across their faces, white collars and billowing black vestments in a manner familiar to followers of the Dutch and Flemish masters. The difference is that their faces are varying shades of brown. Helfman, 61, wanted to create historical documentation of a population that never was. The images subvert the obvious storyline -- that social strata often break down along racial lines. Her photos are a \"contradiction,\" she said, to the stories of inequality that are being told in protests across the United States. \"When I shot them I had the same inspirations, but we didn't have issues that were so highly charged as we're dealing with now racially,\" Helfman said. \"In my lifetime I've seen them come up over and over and then something inflames them again, and it just shows you we haven't gotten there.\" \"There,\" meaning equality.

        "In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?\n\nArticle: Milwaukee (CNN) -- While there is a short-term and potential electoral edge in Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate, it is politically risky and violates what should be the guiding principle in choosing a vice-presidential nominee: \"First, do no harm.\" In the end, the choice may do more harm than good. The son of a lawyer, Ryan was born and raised in Janesville, a city in the southern Wisconsin. His working-class credentials include driving an Oscar Mayer wiener truck. Ryan's rise in state politics began improbably in 1998 when at the age of 28 he handily won the open seat contest for Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District in what was an otherwise disastrous year for the Republican Party. Opinion: Paul Ryan and Gen X GOP . There is no doubt that Ryan is charismatic, resilient and sharp. When he was a teenager, his father, like his grandfather and great-grandfather, died of a heart attack in his 50s. As a result, Ryan has shown a consistent dedication to physical health. In early mornings in Washington, he leads lawmakers through regimented workouts. The man is driven. His swift ascent in the nation's capital as one of the most promising young leaders of the GOP was cemented in part by his highly touted \"Path to Prosperity\" budget plan. But in his home state, it is not clear how much Wisconsinites know about him since he has never held statewide office. As Romney slightly trails Obama in Wisconsin, perhaps Ryan could improve Romney's chance of winning over the voters. A survey of Wisconsin voters from the middle of July tested the impact of adding Ryan to the ticket and found that doing so would cut a six-point Obama lead to just a one-point lead. It's hard to predict the overall statewide impact on Election Day. Wisconsin is not a solidly Democratic or Republican state; it is a sharply divided, very middle-of-the-road part of the country.

He takes nearly one-quarter \u2014\u00a023% \u2014\u00a0of Republicans surveyed in the new nationwide poll, putting him 10 points ahead of his closest competitor, New Jersey Gov.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a liberal favorite, comes in a distant second place with just 9%. Bush would still face some skepticism from GOP primary voters if he ran, but the CNN/ORC poll shows they are largely willing to forgive him for some of his more controversial comments and positions. GOP primary voters are about evenly split on whether his support for allowing some illegal immigrants to stay in the United States makes them more or less likely to support him, or has no difference on their opinion of him.

His name is Rango, a strange-looking lizard with the voice of Johnny Depp, and he's the current king of the box office. In 2009, only one fully animated film, \"Up,\" was among the 10 biggest domestic grossers of the year. In 2010, the box office crown was taken by \"Toy Story 3,\" and it was among five films in the top 10. In both years, animated films grossed well over $1 billion. \"Rango\" isn't alone at the box office this year, either. Live-action/animation hybrid \"Hop\" has been the No. 1 movie for two weekends running, while the last weekend in February saw Disney's computer-animated romantic comedy \"Gnomeo & Juliet\" holding its own in its third week in theaters, just barely coming in second to that weekend's new comedy \"Hall Pass.\" \"Gnomeo\" is approaching a total take of $100 million in the United States. This weekend sees the release of the animated musical \"Rio,\" which has already made more than $50 million internationally. The sequel \"Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil\" is out later this month. Animation as a box office force (despite a few exceptions) couldn't come about only because of families with young kids. Rabid fans of the genre often follow every release  and enjoy the artistic aspect of it as well as the fact that so many of the films work on a completely different level for adults. \"The output of animated features in the last few years has definitely opened up from when I was a kid 20 years ago,\" said Michael Howe, a writer for JimHillMedia.com, who has a degree in animation from Illinois Institute of Art-Chicago. \"There is a variety to the marketplace these days that can allow us to pick and choose from the pop-culture oriented fare from DreamWorks or allow us to seek out the unfamiliar like Studio Ghibli's 'Spirited Away.' \" Chicago resident Howe has been inspired since childhood by the medium: \"With animation, there is the potential to take us to new worlds or...",

        "Condense the article down to the essentials to present it in the form of short cards in mobile news apps:\n\n(Financial Times) -- Foreign auditing firms will have to appoint a Chinese national as their chief partner in China as part of a sweeping overhaul of the country's accounting industry. The regulations, unveiled on Thursday, are aimed at localising the mainland operations of foreign auditing firms, but they also provide for a lengthy transition period and wiggle room to limit controversy over the changes. Chinese auditing standards have come under fire over the past year after a number of fraud allegations against Chinese companies listed in overseas markets. The restructuring of the China operations of foreign auditing firms, including the \"Big Four\", threatened to fuel concerns by forcing them to replace all of their foreign partners with Chinese partners. Beijing has tried to allay such fears, however, by giving foreign groups time to adjust. Up to 40 per cent of their partners in China will be allowed to continue operating without Chinese qualifications this year, the finance ministry said. That cap will then be reduced to 20 per cent by the end of 2017. \"They have made huge concessions here to try to have a smooth transition,\" said Paul Gillis, a professor of accounting at Peking University. The Chinese joint venture agreements of the four biggest accounting firms -- Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PwC -- start to expire this year and Beijing could have imposed the rule changes as soon as they come up for renewal. \"The normal situation in the world is that accounting firms must be owned by locally qualified accountants. That is the case in most countries in the world. China is actually being more open to non-qualified foreigners participating in their practices,\" Mr Gillis said. Nevertheless, the restructuring will pose a challenge for foreign firms. Given how young the auditing industry is in China, they have few local employees who are ready to be senior partners. The restructuring announcement comes a few days after US officials said that China was considering a compromise on another contentious...",

Alberto Morales, 42, was killed shortly after he was located in a wooded area in Grapevine, near Dallas, said Grapevine Police Department spokesman Sgt. Robert Eberling. With the help of a helicopter, authorities found Morales not far from a home where someone stole jewelery and men's clothing. \"At this point, as far as the investigation is concerned, Mr. Morales was shot and is now deceased. This matter is still under investigation ... and we'll have more details at a later point,\" Eberling told reporters. He declined to say whether the escapee was armed and did not elaborate on the circumstances surrounding Morales' death. Eberling stressed the case remains under investigation. Morales' death ended a manhunt that began on Monday. It was then that police say he stabbed a Florida detective multiple times and disappeared. That detective, and another, had been transporting Morales from Florida to Nevada. The trip began on a Miami-Houston-Las Vegas flight. Prior to landing in Houston, Morales began \"acting erratically,\" according to a statement from the Miami-Dade Police Department. As a result, he and the detectives were not allowed to board their connecting flight, it said. The detectives rented a vehicle and continued on their way, making a pit stop in Grapevine to use the restroom. While one of the detectives was inside, Morales stabbed Det. Jaime Pardinas, a 28-year veteran, multiple times, and fled the scene, authorities said. Pardinas was treated at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas and was listed in serious condition, the statement said. Morales was arrested in Nevada in 2008. He was brought to Miami, where he was jailed pending a 2003 case alleging burglary, kidnapping and sexual battery. In December, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which was to run consecutive to a Nevada sentence. Details of...",

        [
            "(CNN) -- When Hugh Jackman first called his director for \"The Wolverine,\" James Mangold told him that he had had an inspiration after reading the script. Mangold wanted to make the set-in-Japan film similar to \"The Outlaw Josey Wales\" by making the mutant a Josey Wales with healing powers. Jackman hadn't seen the classic Clint Eastwood film, so Mangold sent him a copy. \"I felt like tonally, it would give him a clue of what I was talking about,\" the director said. The director started thinking about the deep affinity between gun-slinging Westerns and swordfighting samurai films. Mangold thought that drawing upon both of them would help \"The Wolverine\" stand apart from the rest of the X-Men series. This installment takes place after \"X-Men: The Last Stand,\" as Wolverine retreats from killing the love of his life, Jean Grey/Dark Phoenix, and heads to Japan. It is based on the comic by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, and Mangold thought of it as Hugh Jackman in a Western in Japan, without the horse. To make sense of this movie mashup, the director tweeted images from the top ten inspirations for \"The Wolverine,\" daring fans to identify them. Astute fans of Mangold's body of work (which includes \"Cop Land,\" \"Walk the Line\" and \"3:10 to Yuma\") might have spotted the 1959 Yasujiro Ozu film \"Floating Weeds,\" since the director has cited it as one of the best films of all time as well as a major influence on his first film, \"Heavy.\" \"Ozu is the most underappreciated Japanese director, in my mind,\" Mangold said. \"For me, the whole trip that Logan takes south to the Nagasaki area, it's almost the reverse train trip that the older couple take in 'Tokyo Story.' \" \"But it's also about that sense of the beauty and simplicity of rural Japanese life,\" he added. \"When I started scouting Japan, the world of the Ozu films still exists. You ride south; you find yourself in a simple fishing village, and it looks unchanged since the postwar period.\" Depicting the atomic bomb being dropped on Nagasaki in \"The Wolverine,\" and the..."

On Saturday, the Navy said there was no damage to the submarine's propulsion unit. No injuries were reported aboard the New Orleans. The ship's fuel tank ruptured, spilling 25,000 gallons of marine diesel fuel in the Strait of Hormuz, the U.S. Navy said in the Saturday statement. \"Aerial searches of the area where the fuel spill occurred were conducted yesterday, and revealed no indication of any remaining fuel on the ocean's surface,\" the Navy said. \"The quick dissipation of the fuel is likely due to the type of fuel, and various environmental factors to include air and water temperatures, winds and seas.\" When the collision occurred, both vessels were headed to ports in the Persian Gulf to stock up on provisions and allow for some recreation, Navy spokesman Lt. Nate Christensen said Friday. Christensen said there were about 200 sailors in the sub and 1,000 sailors and Marines aboard the ship.

The book's first printing generated controversy over failing to attribute some passages to Wikipedia, which Anderson said in his blog was a mistake and will be corrected. Chris Anderson says technology allows giants like Google to give away services. (CNN) -- When Christine Varney was confirmed in May as the Obama administration's top antitrust cop, some of her words from last year sent a chill through the Googleplex, the search engine's headquarters in Silicon Valley. During the waning days of the Bush administration, Varney worried that the government would not do enough about Google: \"I think we're going to continually see a problem, potentially, with Google, who I think so far has acquired a monopoly in Internet online advertising lawfully.\" Now she's in a position to do something about it. Having a legally obtained monopoly is not a crime, but abusing it to gain unfair advantages in other markets can be. The most recent landmark cases on this in technology have been the decade-long investigations and prosecutions on Microsoft's dominance of PC software. In those cases, competitors complained that the software giant's near-monopoly on operating systems allowed it to get the upper hand in other markets, for example, by gaining an advantage on the Web through bundling Microsoft's Internet Explorer with every copy of Windows. Now Google has Microsoft-like dominance in search and search advertising. What should it not be allowed to do? That question may come to define this era of antitrust law. When Varney was confirmed, she withdrew the Bush administration's report setting relatively conservative standards of antitrust enforcement and declared, \"The Antitrust Division will be aggressively pursuing cases where monopolists try to use their dominance in the marketplace to stifle competition and harm consumers.\" How might Google's dominance be harming...",

Bowe Bergdahl, a former Taliban prisoner, on Thursday wrapped up a two-day interview with an Army investigating officer to discuss his disappearance in Afghanistan five years ago. After disappearing from his post in June 2009, the soldier, now 28, spent five years in the hands of Taliban militants. Bergdahl's civilian attorney was present for the interviews. The investigation is ongoing, Army spokesman Wayne Hall said. Bergdahl attorney Eugene Fidell described Wednesday's portion of questioning as both long and productive. \"He answered every question that was put to him,\" Fidell said Wednesday about his client. \"I think it was helpful, personally, to Sgt. Bergdahl to be able to tell his story, you know, to a person in a position of responsibility without a lot of sort of intermediation by third parties.\" After he was released in May in exchange for five senior Taliban members held by the U.S. military, Bergdahl underwent counseling and medical care at a hospital in San Antonio, where he is now back on regular duty at Fort Sam Houston. The news of Bergdahl's freedom initially was met with jubilation, but the mood quickly turned as many called for an investigation into his disappearance and captivity. Some critics accused the soldier of deserting his comrades in war. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent, something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official recently told CNN. Bergdahl works at the headquarters of U.S. Army North in Texas.

Those at the memorial, held at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, recalled Wheldon not only as a successful driver, but remembered his winning charm, his sense of humor, and his devotion to his family and his fans. Wheldon, 33, was near the back of a 34-car field at the Las Vegas Indy 300 on October 16 when he got mixed up in a crash that saw several cars spin out of control and burst into flames, spewing smoke and debris. He died of head injuries. \"The victories and the accolades, they didn't define him,\" said IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard. \"His strong character, his enthusiastic approach to life, and the love of family, friends and fans did. \"There was a reason he was a fan favorite,\" Bernard said. \"I'd see him go out of his way to shake a serviceman's hand, or sign a young man's autograph, or do that extra interview, or just joke around with the drivers. Dan loved life and it always showed.\" Featured on stage beside the speakers Sunday was a car Bernard said Wheldon had been testing. It had \"cutting-edge enhancements that promised to move the sport of racing and automotive engineering forward.\" It also had additional safety features, testament to Wheldon's commitment to improving the sport and increasing safety for drivers, he said. \"He would want the drivers and the teams and the series to unite and to work together,\" Bernard said. \"He'd want us to strive to make our sport safer.\" The memorial featured music from country artists Reba McEntire and The Band Perry. Wheldon's family was in attendance. \"It was a privilege for us to witness a young, carefree racer blossom into a true champion and a devoted family man,\" said one of Wheldon's managers, Mickey Ryan. He recalled Wheldon partying all night after his first Indianapolis 500 win in 2005, then falling asleep while on hold waiting for an early morning radio interview....",

When it comes to energy, Ernst, a Republican state senator, and Braley, a Democratic congressman, both have controversial positions to defend to voters. Ernst elaborated on her position to shutter the Environmental Protection Agency, a move that critics say will make Iowa more polluted. Braley, meanwhile, explained his flip-flopping on the Keystone Pipeline that has left some Iowans skeptical about his commitment to create jobs. The debate made it clear: Environmental regulation is the issue where the 2014 hopefuls really differ. The states know how to best protect their natural resources, Ernst said, saying that \"the EPA has overreached.\" Braley accused his Republican opponent of not wanting to ensure the cleanliness of the country's air and water. Braley himself was put on the defensive when he was asked why he had switched his position from supporting the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline to opposing it. \"When the pipeline was first proposed and we were first asked to vote on it, a lot of promises were made about what was going to happen with the oil produced in that pipeline and the jobs it created,\" Braley said. \"But the more I looked into it and the more I talked to Iowans, there was no guarantee that the oil produced and sent through that pipeline was going to stay in the United States and benefit U.S. consumers. And there was no guarantee that a lot of jobs would be create for Iowans.\" The pipeline, which has yet to receive federal approval, would not run through Iowa, although the Republican Patty of Iowa strongly supports the measure as a part of their platform. At the center of the energy debate, the candidates swapped jabs about another kind of green: special interest dollars.

French composer Maurice Jarre wrote scores for films by Hollywood legends like John Huston, Alfred Hitchcock and David Lean. Last month, the 84 year-old who died Sunday gave one of his final interviews to CNN's The Screening Room, in conversation with fellow composer Alexandre Desplat. Jarre, who died of cancer, worked with many  legendary directors, like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston. But it is the French composer's work with British director David Lean -- the scores to \"Lawrence of Arabia,\" \"Dr Zhivago,\" and \"A Passage to India,\" for which he won three Oscars --  for which he is best remembered. Twice Oscar-nominated French composer Alexandre Desplat, who has written the scores for Stephen Frears' 2006 drama \"The Queen,\" and last year's \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\" regarded Jarre as an inspiration and an influence. \"Maurice was an immense artist; an incredible symphonist; a magician of the melody and a benevolent human being,\" Desplat told CNN in tribute to Jarre who he describes as the greatest composer of the last 50 years. Alexandre Desplat: I don't know if you know, but the path that you traced for us French composers is phenomenal and indispensable. And, of course, love for cinema and theater is something that unites us, because I also wrote a lot for the theater like yourself. Maurice Jarre: The love for cinema, that's correct.

With California's two Senate seats locked down for more than two decades by Boxer and Sen.

Carol Edmonds, 60, an iReporter known as SadTimesInNC, said she shot the video the afternoon of July 25 during a break in the second-to-last day of the session. That night, the state Senate passed a restrictive abortion bill, and the House approved controversial voter ID legislation. The iReport was originally titled \"NC House Dances With Joy Over Their Accomplishments\" and suggested Republican lawmakers were doing a victory dance after a contentious session. The iReporter later changed the headline to \"Opinion: Really? On The Day NC's Voters Rights Were Suppressed and Women's Rights Were Assaulted\". Within a couple days, the video racked up nearly 100,000 page views and 31,000 people shared it on Facebook. State Rep. Paul Stam, a Republican, told CNN that the musician playing in the video is his former legislative assistant, Christin Danchi, who is leaving for music school in the fall. The young woman performed a few classical numbers and finished with some bluegrass. The man dancing in the video is state Rep. Phil Shepard, a Republican, and his dance partner is the principal clerk of the House, according to a report from CNN affiliate NBC Charlotte. A few others are seen taking pictures or clapping.

Not only are insects annoying, they can carry diseases such as West Nile virus and Lyme disease. But what's the best way to ward off these pests? A new report, released Wednesday by the Environmental Working Group, finds that no one bug repellent works against every insect, but your best bets are those products made with active ingredients registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientific tests have shown that four registered chemicals provide a high level of protection from a number of bug bites, according to the EWG report: Picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (and its synthetic derivative known as p-Menthane-3,8-diol, or PMD) and DEET. These chemicals are found in many of the popular products on your drugstore shelves. Despite DEET's reputation as a harmful substance, the EWG researchers found it to be one of the most effective chemicals against the risks of West Nile virus and Lyme disease. \"We found them all to be safe, especially if people don't overdose on the product,\" said David Andrews, lead author on the study and a researcher with EWG. \"And these chemicals do protect people against a lot of rather nasty insects.\" And that's important because insect-borne illnesses are on the rise. The West Nile virus, which is carried by mosquitoes, infected more than 5,600 Americans last year, and 286 people died from the virus, according to the CDC. A report this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association noted that the virus, which had been declining over the past few years, spiked in 2012, especially in Texas. By analyzing the epidemic in Dallas County, Texas, researchers found serious West Nile outbreaks begin early, after unusually warm winters. They also seem to be concentrated in one area every year.

A Palestinian man walks by Banksy's camel, painted on the security barrier near Bethlehem. As part of the project, Banksy has adorned the controversial security barrier around the West Bank town with spray paint and plaster works of art in a comment on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Israel says the purpose of the barrier is to prevent terrorist attacks being launched from the West Bank. Palestinian leaders however say the barrier amounts to an illegitimate land grab by Israelis, setting unilateral borders for an eventual Palestinian state. The new exhibition, called \"Santa's Ghetto Bethlehem 2007,\" is a collaboration by artists who say they are trying to revitalize tourism to Bethlehem and \"offer the ink-stained hand of friendship to ordinary people in an extraordinary situation.\" Banksy's sketches on the security barrier flow towards Manger Square, across from the Church of the Nativity, where Christians believe Jesus was born. His images include a dove wearing a bullet-proof vest, a young girl in a frilly pink dress frisking a soldier and a donkey being checked for its identity papers. According to the Web site for Santa's Ghetto, Banksy thought he was making an ironic commentary with the donkey picture, but locals told him the animals are frequently asked for ID papers. Santa's Ghetto typically operates during the month of December out of a small store on Oxford Street in London, where underground artists showcase their work. Banksy, who started the initiative six years ago, says: \"I felt the spirit of Christmas was being lost.

But this week, it contorted again, when the country's former spy chief disappeared. Horacio Antonio Stiuso was supposed to testify  Thursday about the mysterious death of a special prosecutor, who had leveled scathing accusations at Fernandez. Authorities have not been able to find the ex-director of the Secretary of Intelligence, let alone notify him that he has been called to testify. The intrigue surrounding him, the dead prosecutor and the President dates back to 1994 -- when a car bomb demolished a Jewish center in Buenos Aires, killing 85 people. Special prosecutor Alberto Nisman implicated Iran in the attack, in his nearly 300-page investigation report. Then he accused Fernandez of covering up Tehran's involvement to sweeten a trade deal. Cash-strapped Argentina would allegedly get Iranian oil in exchange for meat and grain. Shortly after filing his report and one day before he was to testify before lawmakers about his allegations in January, Nisman was found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head. In his trash can, investigators found a draft warrant for Fernandez's arrest. The President was quick to call it a suicide but changed her story a few days later. A test found no gunpowder residue on Nisman's hands, as would have been expected if he had pulled the trigger. Fernandez's government blamed the intelligence agency for his death, and the President filed a bill for the agency to be dissolved and replaced by the new Federal Intelligence Agency. The Senate took up debate on the bill on Wednesday. Supporters hope to have it on Fernadez's desk to sign by February 25. And she pointed the finger at Stiuso, accusing him of feeding Nisman false information and having a hand in his death. Stiuso was using Nisman to discredit her for firing Stiuso last year, she claimed. But Stiuso's replacement, Oscar Parrilli, reeled him back in -- not as an agent,...",

The world No. 1 thought the players should have been consulted on Madrid's decision to depart from the traditional red clay and the Serbian cut a frustrated figure on court. \"It's impossible to move,\" he was quoted as telling reporters by AFP. \"I hit maybe five balls, the rest went just trying to put the ball into the court. \"I was relying on serve and getting free points from his unforced errors. That was not tennis, either I need football shoes or some advice on how to play on this court. \"I cannot find the words to describe this court. It's really tough to play like this on a center court. We need serious discussion about the future of this blue clay. \"We cannot change anything this year, but my first impressions are not good.

        [
            "(CNN) -- Seven years after the sidelining of Colonel Reb, the goateed planter who conjured images of the Old South, the University of Mississippi has a new mascot to do antics for children, visit the sick in hospitals and, yes, cheer on the Red and Blue at fall football games. Ole Miss on Thursday announced that Rebel Black Bear had outpolled other contenders to earn the honors, beginning in 2011. Nobel Prize-winning novelist William Faulkner, whose home still stands near the campus in Oxford, Mississippi, wrote a short story titled \"The Bear.\" In it, Old Ben stands as a symbol of pride, strength and toughness. Extensive polling resulted in the bear defeating the Rebel Land Shark and Hotty Toddy, based on a cheer exchanged between Ole Miss fans, the mascot selection committee announced Thursday. Some Mississippi students had launched a campaign to put Admiral Ackbar from \"Star Wars\" on the ballot, but it fell short. About 13,000 people participated in each of two polls on the issue. The selection puts a symbolic end to Colonel Reb, who enjoyed lingering popularity among many Ole Miss fans. The university for years has distanced itself from association with symbols of the Confederacy. In 1997, it effectively excluded presence of Confederate flags at athletic events by not allowing any banners to be flown from a stick. \"While we might not all agree with the [student] committee's selection, I am confident that we will come together and continue to strongly support the Ole Miss Rebels,\" alumni association President Charles Clark said. \"I know that my love of Ole Miss is as strong as ever, and that I will be in Tuscaloosa on Saturday night cheering loudly for our Rebels.\" The Rebels will be on the road Saturday playing the Alabama Crimson Tide. It's now up Michael Thompson to have the mascot ready to compete against the likes of South Carolina's garnet rooster, Cocky, Auburn's striped tiger, Aubie, and the Georgia's muscle-bound Harry Dawg. \"I was given the black bear and told 'make it happen',\" said Thompson,..."

The bus crashed about 5:30 a.m. near the town of Espinar, Peru, Lt. Edilberto Tunquipa of the Espinar fire department said. Interviews with survivors pointed to driver fatigue as one of the possible causes of the crash, Tunquipa said. The bus had left the city of Arequipa about seven hours earlier, heading to the town of Santo Tomas in the mountains, he said. The poor conditions of the road were another possible factor, he added. No international tourists were believed to be on the bus, though authorities could not confirm that, Tunquipa said. The 20 people injured were in hospitals, their injuries ranging from severe head and back injuries to minor scrapes, he said.  Most of the victims were believed to be locals who work in Arequipa and were returning home to their small towns for Christmas, he said. The exact number of people on the bus remained unknown. The bus holds 52 people, Tunquipa said, but it was overcrowded, with people standing in the aisle. CNN's Mariano Castillo and Esprit Smith contributed to this report."

Now, the itch caused by bedbugs is causing relationships to come under even more pressure. New Yorkers say they have increasingly heard tales of couples breaking up because of the little creatures that have infested New York homes, stores and movie theaters. One man, interviewed randomly on the street, said he knew someone who broke up because of the bugs who like to hide in mattresses. He said that's \"because they were scared to death about bugs. She wouldn't date him because he had bedbugs, and she freaked out.\" The fear of bedbugs is also heightening intimacy tensions. Stacie Handwerker, a real estate attorney, said, \"I was dating a guy, and he asked me do you have any bedbugs in [your] apartment? Because if you do, you won't be seeing me!\" The exterminators are on the front lines of the bedbug battles, and they have seen the casualties: romance. Timothy Wong, the technical director of M&M Environmental exterminators in lower Manhattan, said he has seen couples break up because of bedbugs. \"The girlfriend had them at home, and the boyfriend didn't stick by her, so it actually destroyed that relationship,\" he said. \"I got rid of the bedbugs, but I wasn't able to salvage the relationship, but I'm sure there were other problems before that,\" said Wong. The phones were ringing nonstop in his offices. Wong says the callers are usually the ones not getting bitten. Some of the callers blame their loved one, claiming they don't have any bites. Relationship and life coach Donna Barnes said bedbugs are a creepy aspect to dating right now. She advises not telling people on the first date you have bedbugs. She says that when the relationship is escalating, it's a good idea to inform the other person if you are bringing him or her into areas of potential exposure, Barnes said. She recalled a client who admitted having bedbugs. \"She was horrified, embarrassed and didn't want to tell anybody.\" Barnes cautions \"if that's the case, you're better off to...",

Among the world's 35 largest countries, Mexico had the highest death rates from sugary drinks, and Bangladesh had the lowest, according to the study. The United States ranked third. However, the American Beverage Association dismissed the research as \"more about sensationalism than science.\" Opinion: Banning large sodas is legal and smart . When people drink too many beverages containing added sugar, such as soft drinks, fruit drinks, energy or sports beverages, they tend to put on weight. The study authors say these added pounds increase the risk of developing diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers -- conditions often referred to as obesity-related diseases. Researchers at Harvard wanted to find out how often people around the globe drank sugar-sweetened beverages and how that affected their risk of death. They looked at 114 national dietary surveys covering more than 60% of the world's population. They also used evidence from studies published in medical journals that discussed sugary drinks and other dietary habits. Their data was included in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study, which looks at the health and mortality of populations across the world. How did the Harvard scientists single out that sweet drinks were linked to weight gain and death? They spent several years gathering and combing through data. They looked at all kinds of factors that can affect our weight such as TV watching, changes in physical activity levels, smoking and the consumption of all kinds of food and drink. When the researchers controlled for these factors, they were able to determine what percentage...",

        "Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?\n\nArticle: \"Smart\" TVs have failed because they've always assumed more is better. Instead of evolving the television experience, TV makers have simply added to it, heaping more streams, more services, and more content onto our sets without rethinking the interfaces for accessing them. The same problem plagues the services that power those smart TVs. Netflix offers thousands of options for what to watch, but instead of giving you a chance to skip through and sample them, it makes you evaluate each one, like a title on a video-store shelf. In both cases, the experience has become more about selecting a piece of content than simply watching TV. The result? More ends up feeling like a lot less. That's the central problem plaguing both set-top boxes like Roku and Apple TV and content services like Netflix and Amazon Instant Video. Instead of letting you lean back and soak up content, these new challengers require decisions -- a careful cost-benefit analysis of thousands of different options. If the traditional TV experience is about letting viewers surf channels, today's on-demand video is like giving them a speedboat and forcing them choose a destination before they can even get in the water. It's the fundamental reason smart TV and streaming video user interfaces pale in comparison to regular TV for so much of our daily viewing. And it's a shame. The channels we've always known are the perfect interface for TV. For some reason, we seem hell-bent on abandoning them. The simple joy of channel surfing .

The Greenwich Village resident rolled around 'laughing on the ground' and proudly told officers 'yeah, I shot him in the head' as he was arrested five blocks away from where Carson was killed, the Manhattan Criminal Court heard on Sunday. Suspect: Elliot Morales, 33, pictured, was charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime, menacing and two counts of possession of a weapon in a Manhattan court on Sunday . Police said Morales used a silver Taurus .38-caliber revolver to shoot Carson at point-blank range as he walked with his 33-year-old companion on Sixth Avenue near West Eighth Street. Morales was ordered held without bail pending another court appearance on Thursday. His attorney, Reginald Sharpe, could not be reached for comment. On Saturday, minutes before opening fire in the lively Village streets, police say Morales followed Carson and his companion and asked them 'Are you afraid? Do you watch the news? Do you know what happened in Sandy Hook?' according to the New York Post. He then asked Carson, 'Do you want to die here,' Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said.

            "(CNN) -- Casey Anthony walked free from a Florida jail early Sunday morning, three years and one day after she was first arrested for her role in the disappearance and, eventually, death of her 2-year-old daughter. Anthony walked out of the front door of the Orange County Jail at 12:09 a.m. with her lawyer by her side and two Special Response Team officers with green vests. Sheriff's deputies had two contingency plans laid out, but in the end opted to go with a public release. \"We have made every effort to not provide any special treatment for her,\" said Allen Moore, the spokesman for the Orange County Corrections Department in a statement. \"She has been treated like every other inmate in her custody class.\" Anthony had not received threats against her at the jail, but \"this release had an unusual amount of security. So therefore, in that sense, it would not be a normal release,\" Moore said. With $537.68 from her inmate account handed to her, Anthony offered a quick thanks to a Special Response Team sergeant. She then walked out of the jail building doors and into a dark-colored sport utility vehicle. Her hair was pulled up in a tight bun and she had on a bright pink V-neck T-shirt, blue jeans and sneakers. She did not show any emotion. Given the threats against her life by those furious at the not-guilty verdict, Anthony's lawyers have not said where she will go next. News helicopters that tracked the SUV showed it head to downtown Orlando and into the parking garage of her lawyer  Cheney Mason's office. Throngs of television camera crews and a crowd of about 1,000 people were at hand outside the jail to witness the release. Most of those who waved placards in the jail parking lot were there to voice their opposition to Anthony's release, but they did so peacefully. Police, some on horseback, kept a wary eye. As Anthony left, some demonstrators shouted and jeered. Some screamed, \"Killer!\" The Orlando woman's release comes 12 days after a jury acquitted her on murder and child neglect charges.

            "(CNN) -- The Navy detonated a large device described as being similar to a mine off the coast of Bay Head, New Jersey, Wednesday morning, sending a plume of water more than 100 feet in the air. The device, suspected to be either a moored or contact mine, was discovered Tuesday evening by a swimmer off the coast of Bay Head, about halfway between New York City and Atlantic City. The device was mostly buried in the sand, which made it hard to identify, according to Mike Brady, public affairs officer for the Naval Weapons Station Earle. An explosive ordnance disposal team was sent to detonate the device. The team determined the safest time to detonate the large device, which Brady said weighed several hundred pounds, was during the next high tide at 11 a.m. Wednesday. \"Out of an abundance of caution, we asked the local police to evacuate about 15 families from their homes in the immediate area while the detonation occurred,\" said Brady. The device was about 100 feet from the shoreline in 12 feet of water when the detonation occurred. There were no injuries. Brady said CNN it's unclear how the device got there or how long it had been there. It's possible the device may have moved during Superstorm Sandy, but it may never be clear where it came from. A piece of the device was secured and will be analyzed for clues about its origin. \"It's believed this is a one-of-a-kind event, and there do not appear to be any other devices in the area,\" Brady said.

Just don't expect to get any presents. Or be surprised when your traveling companion introduces himself as \"Mr. Scrooge.\" 1. Go to New Zealand . These days, one of the best ways to take a few hours out from modern life is to fly. With in-flight cellphone reception and free Wi-Fi still relatively rare on commercial flights, it's a rare chance to escape daily stresses. International aviation schedules keep going even over Christmas, so if you really want to spend December 25 out of the festive loop, there are few better ways than ascending to 30,000 feet. Because the pre-Christmas panic is over, tickets often become considerably cheaper -- and the cheaper the fare, the longer the travel time. Admittedly, you'll be dependent on your fellow passengers not trying to celebrate at altitude, but airline food will sap the festive spirit from even the most hardened traveler. New Zealand, thanks to its remote (for most of us) Southern Hemisphere location, makes an ideal destination as it's so far from everywhere else it'll probably take you 24 hours to get there.

Welcome to the Puente Hills Landfill, the largest rubbish dump in America. Over 150 meters of garbage has risen from the ground since the area became a designated dumping site in 1957. Now, six days a week, an army of 1,500 trucks delivers a heaving 12,000 tons of municipal solid waste from the homes and offices of L.A. County's millions of inhabitants. \"This used to be a dairy farm; a valley filled with cows producing milk. And now it's a geological feature made out of trash,\" said Edward Humes, author of \"Garbology: Our Dirty Love Affair with Trash\" -- a book that charts the history of garbage in America. Humes says most of the waste arrives straight from the bins of local residents. \"If you're like most of us -- most Americans -- you're making seven pounds of trash a day. Across a lifetime that adds up to 102 tons of trash per person,\" he said. In 2010 alone, Americans accumulated 250 million tons of garbage, and although recycling in the U.S. has increased by 34% since 1960, Humes believes the country's attitude to waste is still not sustainable. \"It's very convenient to roll your trash to the curb every week and have it disappear, but it's a magic trick -- and really there's not very much magic,\" he said. \"We need to have less packaging; use less disposable items; (use) things that last longer; make purchasing decisions that are more studied and less wasteful.\" The environmental impact of landfill sites varies depending on how well they're managed and resourced. However, typical problems include the contamination of soil and groundwater from toxic residues; the release of methane, a greenhouse gas produced during the decaying process that is more potent than carbon dioxide; and disease-carrying pests.

Tennessee is not alone. Saying schools are struggling to meet the student progress requirements of the No Child Left Behind law, the White House announced Monday it would be signing waivers that will relieve schools of some of the key provisions of the law. \"The law -- No Child Left Behind -- as it currently stands is four years overdue for being rewritten. It is far too punitive, it is far too prescriptive, lead to a dummying down of standards, lead to a narrowing of the curriculum,\" Education Secretary Arne Duncan said at a White House press briefing on Monday. \"We can't afford to have the law of the land be one that has so many perverse incentives or disincentives to the kind of progress that we want to see.\" The law requires that all students meet reading and math adequacy by 2014. If they don't, the schools are subject to reforms. As the standards have increased annually, schools are finding it increasingly difficult to meet them. \"We hope that this is simply a transition or bridge to fixing the law,\" Duncan said of the waiver plans. Rather than a large sweeping bill to reauthorize the entire Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), also known as No Child Left Behind Act, Rep. John Kline's committee has been working on smaller, more specific bills throughout the summer, to address ESEA concerns. The Republican-led House Education and the Workforce committee has passed three bills intended to streamline education programs, address charter school issues and give states and localities more flexibility in spending their federal dollars. These bills have not yet made it to the House floor for debate, nor have they come up in the Democratic-led Senate for debate. Only one of the bills -- the one on charter schools -- passed out of the House committee with bipartisan support. The committee is expected to take up separate legislation on teacher effectiveness...",

Jeb Bush after a convincing victory the night before in the Illinois primary but then saw a top adviser's televised comment provide new ammunition to his trailing rivals in the Republican presidential race. Eric Fehrnstrom, Romney's senior campaign adviser, was asked in a CNN interview Wednesday morning whether the former Massachusetts governor had been forced to adopt conservative positions in the rugged race that could hurt his standing with moderates in November's general election. \"I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign.

You can kind of shake it up, and we start all over again.\" Rival candidates Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, who are vying for conservative support against the more moderate Romney, seized on the comment as indicative of their longstanding criticism that Romney shifts his positions on issues such as health care reform and abortion to suit his political needs. Gingrich brought out an Etch A Sketch at a campaign appearance in Louisiana, where the next primary takes place Saturday. \"You have to stand for something that lasts longer than this,\" Gingrich said at the Lake Charles event, holding the drawing toy invented in 1959. \"You could not have found a more perfect illustration of why people distrust Romney than to have his (adviser) say that the Etch A Sketch allows you to erase everything in the general election,\" Gingrich added. \"You have to read the guy's quote to realize -- if he had set out to highlight for everybody why we distrust Romney, I think he couldn't have done a better job.\" Santorum's campaign posted a photo on Twitter of the candidate using an Etch A Sketch, saying it showed him \"studying up on (Romney's) policy positions.\" Romney \"will say what he needs to say to win the election before him, and if he has to say something different because it's a different election and a different group of voters,..."

            "(CNN) -- In a historic turnaround, the ballot box is showing America's shifting attitudes about same-sex marriage. After gay marriage rights died at the polls dozens of times in the past, on Tuesday they passed in at least two states. Rarely do popular votes reflect such dramatic social changes. The result: Maryland and Maine will now allow couples like Chyrino Patane and James Trinidad to tie the knot. The Maryland couple has been together for seven years, and now, after the historic vote, they plan to marry in the next six months to a year. \"Both families will be at the wedding,\" Patane said. But the win was hard fought and the margin of victory was small. \"We've lost at the ballot box 32 times,\" said Paul Guequierre of Human Rights Campaign. \"History was made tonight.\" In Maine, Erica Tobey and Ali Ouellette wed in September, but only now will the women's marriage be recognized under Maine law. \"It's hard to overstate the national significance of this vote,\" Marc Solomon, campaign director at Freedom to Marry, said of the Maine referendum. Related: French ministers back same-sex marriage . In Maryland, where just 51.9% of voters approved gay marriage rights, \"It was a little bit pins and needles,\" said Human Rights Campaign's Kevin Nix. \"It was going to be a close call all along.\" A similar ballot measure in Washington state is pending. And in Minnesota, voters rejected a measure that would have banned same-sex marriage. Pollsters got a hint of the coming change. Recent national surveys have shown shifting attitudes toward same-sex marriage, with a majority of Americans now approving of marriages between two men or two women. A June CNN/ORC poll, for example, reflected such a shift in opinion in the U.S. Support has been growing for decades. In the 1990s, most Americans told pollsters they did not know anyone close to them who was gay. By 2010, the number of Americans who said they had a gay or lesbian close friend or family member was 49%. This year, that number stands at 60%. Maryland, Maine approve..."

Surgeon David Sellu, 66, was found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter over the death of father of six James Hughes, following a trial at the Old Bailey. Mr Hughes, 66, died at the Clementine Churchill Hospital in Harrow, north-west London, on February 14, 2010. Sellu, of Hillingdon, west London, was found not guilty of perjury after he was accused of lying to the victim\u2019s inquest under oath. James Hughes (right) was in excruciating pain, the Old Bailey heard. Although Dr David Sellu (left) knew his patient had a perforated bowel, . he failed to operate for 40 hours. Mr Hughes later died . Mr Hughes suffered an unexplained tear to his bowel after a routine knee operation at the privately-run Churchill Clementine Hospital in Harrow, northwest London.

With just days until the June 14 election, a cyber-voting space is running a \"virtual election.\" This campaign -- free from the Islamic regime's constraints -- is helping to provide a virtual space for voters inside Iran to \"freely\" choose their preferred candidate. Russian chess legend Garry Kasparov is leading this effort, known as the \"We Choose\" campaign. He is joined by other internationally recognized former government officials, human rights advocates and technology experts. \"Democracy is both a political right and a human right,\" said Kasparov, chairman of the We Choose global committee. \"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Iran has also signed, declares that the will of the people shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections -- which are not the case in the current system of Iran, so if we want to understand the real opinion of the Iranian people, we need to give them an alternative platform to vote and to express their preferences,\" he said.

Soon after, the opposition was systematically crushed by regime forces, which left the massive movement for change in Iran shattered.

The 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196R fetched $29.65 million Friday at the auction in southern England, said Bonhams, with the identity of the buyer not disclosed. That figure beat the previous record -- a 1957 Ferrari was purchased in 2011 -- by about $13 million, added Bonhams. \"I have handled some of the world's most desirable and important motor cars during a motoring auction career spanning five decades, but I have reached a peak with this legendary grand prix car,\" Robert Brooks, the Bonhams chairman, said. \"It was a personal privilege to preside over the sale of this vehicle, which is not only one of the most significant motor cars of the 20th century but also the most important historic grand prix racing car ever offered for sale,\" he added. Argentina's Fangio used the car en route to winning the second of his five world titles. Soon after it was placed in a museum. Fangio won a record 45 percent of the grand prix he entered and started nearly 60 percent of his races from pole position -- reigning Formula One king Sebastian Vettel doesn't come close to matching that. He won the championship with four different teams -- the only man to achieve the feat -- and is also the oldest Formula One champion, claiming the title in 1957 at the age of 46. \"If he were here today Fangio would shake his head and smile his slow smile,\" Doug Nye, a racing historian, told Bonhams' website. \"He was a humble man, originally a mechanic from a potato town in Argentina and never forgot his roots. \"As a driver he was simply a genius.\"",

In 2009, the number was 354. Police said the greatest growth in the category came among students.  In 2009, 23 students killed themselves. In 2010, the number grew to 53 -- a 130% increase. The stark figures stood in contrast to the overall decrease in the number of suicides in Japan, down 3.5% to 31,690.  About 127 million people live in the island nation. Police figures also showed an increase in the number of child caretakers who killed themselves. The number in 2010 grew to 157, up 44% from 2009. Japan has one of the developed world's highest suicide rates. The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry says the number of suicides in Japan has been over 30,000 per year for 13 years in a row. Prime Minister Naoto Kan has made tackling suicides one of his priorities, saying, in the past that he aimed to \"reduce the factors that make people unhappy.\" On World Suicide Prevention Day last September, the government launched a website featuring a popular soccer star, urging the country become more aware of the warning signs of suicide.

As she's licked her fingers while talking viewers through her recipes, she has earned nicknames such as \"domestic goddess\" and the \"queen of food porn\" in the British media. But her successful cooking career has not been mirrored in her recent personal life. Her 10-year marriage to millionaire art collector Charles Saatchi collapsed after photos of the couple having an argument at a restaurant emerged in June. In the photos -- which were splashed across the front pages of national newspapers at the time -- Saatchi has his hand around Lawson's throat. Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault, and the couple announced they would divorce soon after. Since then, the trial of the couple's two former personal assistants -- who were cleared Friday of defrauding Lawson and Saatchi of hundreds of thousands of pounds -- has gripped the media. This has mainly been thanks to revelations of drug use by Lawson and insights into her troubled marriage to Saatchi. During the trial, the two former assistants, Italian sisters Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo told the court they believed the celebrity chef repeatedly used drugs. Saatchi had said in an e-mail that Lawson had used drugs regularly, but in his testimony before the court last month, he backed off that claim. The court heard that none of the witnesses had seen her take drugs. In her own testimony, Lawson, 53, confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times, during two periods of her life, and used cannabis in the past. But she denied being a habitual user, saying, \"I did not have a drug problem, I had a life problem.\" 'I am not a chef' Her admission of limited drug use may cause some surprise because of Lawson's connections with the British political establishment.

Uighur democracy leader Rebiya Kadeer waits to speak about the unrest in Xinjiang in Washington. The attacks were carried out on the opening day of the Melbourne International Film Festival -- in what organizers are calling the third phase of a \"concerted campaign\" to withdraw the film \"The 10 Conditions of Love.\" The documentary examines the impact on the family of activist Rebiya Kadeer as she fights for greater autonomy of the ethnic minority group, the Uyghurs, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China's northwest. Kadeer is the president of the World Uyghur Congress, made up of exiled Uyghurs. China accuses the group of inciting riots in the region this month that killed more than 200 people and wounded more than 1,000. \"The first stage was the local Chinese embassy asking us to withdraw the film,\" festival director Richard Moore said Sunday. \"The second was to find a way for other Chinese films to withdraw from the festival -- five did so.

Opening statements are scheduled for next week. Peterson's attorney Joel Brodsky told CNN's sister network In Session that he expects the trial to last about a month. Peterson, 58, is charged in the 2004 death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio. He also remains under investigation in the October 2007 disappearance of fourth wife, Stacy Peterson. In April, an Illinois appellate court ruled that prosecutors may use potentially incriminating statements made by Savio and Peterson's still-missing wife against him -- a key development in the case. Ex-cop attends hearing in wife's death . The ruling overturned an earlier judge's decision that forbid prosecutors from using eight statements made by Savio before her death and by Stacy Peterson before her disappearance. When Savio was found dead in a bathtub in 2004, it was ruled accidental. She had been divorced from Peterson for about five months when she died, though a court was still deciding how their marital assets would be divided. Savio was to receive part of Peterson's pension and other support. Just eight days after his divorce from Savio, Peterson married Stacy Cales, then 19. After Stacy Peterson went missing in October 2007, her husband became the focus of a police investigation. Authorities exhumed Savio's body and conducted a second autopsy, this time ruling her death a homicide. Since Savio is dead and Stacy Peterson is missing, the defense has argued that using their alleged statements to family and friends violates Peterson's Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. Among the statements the appeal court allowed is one in which Stacy told her pastor that she saw Drew Peterson return home the morning Savio died, dressed in black and carrying a bag of women's clothes that were not hers. Drew Peterson goes on trial in 3rd...",

Increased funding would boost that number to 2.5 million, while expanding AIDS prevention programs and offering care to millions more with AIDS. Despite some successes, the program has been criticized for requiring that participating groups emphasize abstinence education.

            "(CNN) -- Controversy in figure skating? What took so long? And Canada and the United States play to a familiar result on the hockey rink, while a Canadian faced long odds in the ski cross final four. Cue the conspiracists . Figure skating, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder. And to some the decision of the judges at Thursday's women's free program was downright ugly. As was the subsequent reaction on social media. It didn't help that one of the judges had in the past been suspended for a year for trying to fix an event at the Winter Olympics 16 years ago (apparently they don't have a Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis in figure skating). Or that another is married to the head of the Russian figure skating federation, which is cheering for the first Russian woman to win a gold medal in individual competition after she was awarded the highest score of her life. It was too much for defending Olympic champion Yuna Kim to overcome. Not everyone thinks the judging was crooked. Even though gold medalist Adelina Sotnikova had one notable mistake, she did have the more technical program. And that's where she won; her technical score was 75.54; Kim's was 69.69. Chris Chase of USA Today wrote: \"It's debatable, but not a robbery. Sotnikova skated well enough to win gold. She had a carefully constructed program with seven triples, five of which were in a combo. Kim had six and three, respectively. Thus, Sotnikova was going in with a higher total and made more margin for error, which she took advantage of with a minor hop after one exchange.\" Sotnikova said she knew she had skated well. \"When I had performed all the elements I knew I would be on the podium but not which medal. When I saw I had won on the technical elements I didn't believe my eyes,\" she said. There might be more of an argument that Sotnikova's short program score of 74.64 was a real gift.

Online petitions and social media postings targeted the acts who had signed on to play at the park. Only Justin Moore and Scotty McCreery remain from the original list of acts on the event calendar. Their representatives have not responded to CNN's repeated requests for comment. A promoter could put together a whale of a concert series with the acts that have canceled SeaWorld shows, including Trisha Yearwood, Willie Nelson, Cheap Trick, Heart, Barenaked Ladies, Martina McBride and 38 Special. SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck confirmed Adkins' cancellation, which CNN was initially alerted to through Twitter postings Thursday. \"While we're disappointed a small group of misinformed individuals was able to deny fans what would have been great concerts at SeaWorld, we respect the artists' decisions,\" Gollattscheck said in an e-mailed statement nearly identical to what was sent to CNN when others canceled last month.   \"We expect that other artists will be targeted in this campaign.\" Adkins' show was never officially announced, but it later appeared on his own online schedule for March 2, 2014.

The first version of the Stolen Valor Act was struck down by the Supreme Court as a violation of the First Amendment. Justices dismiss law making lying about military honors a crime . The bill focuses not on people who lie about having medals they didn't earn, but on any profits they make from lying about the medals, which is essentially criminal fraud. Rep. Joe Heck (R-Nevada) sponsored the new bill. His office issued a release saying the bill passed by a vote of 410-3. Heck said in a floor speech this week that the bill would survive judicial review because it resolves the \"constitutional issues by clearly defining that the objective of the law is to target and punish those who misrepresent the alleged service with the intent of profiting personally or financially.\" The bill targets those who falsely claim to have earned certain major military decorations, including the Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross, Air Force Cross, Silver Star, Purple Heart or a medal signifying you served in combat. A similar bill is moving through the Senate, but has not reached a floor vote yet. The Medal of Honor: What is it?",

            "Myth No. 1: A suntan's fine, as long as you don't burn. Reality: While even one sunburn may double the chance of eventually developing melanoma (the most serious type of skin cancer), your kids are still at risk even if they never burn. \"The more sun you get, the more likely you are to develop certain skin cancers,\" says Martin Weinstock, M.D., chairman of the American Cancer Society's Skin Cancer Advisory Group, no matter what your skin tone. \"Any tan indicates damage to your skin.\" Myth No. 2: A beach umbrella blocks the sun. Reality: It's not foolproof. Sand reflects 17 percent of UV radiation, so you're still exposed, says Dr. Weinstock. Nevertheless, it's smart to stay in the shade when the sun's rays are high; just make sure you're also slathered with sunscreen. Myth No. 3: Sun can't penetrate through windows. Reality: Glass filters out only one kind of radiation -- UVB rays. But UVA rays, which penetrate deeper, can still get through. That's why many adults have more freckles on their left side than their right -- it's from UV exposure on that side through the car window when driving. To protect yourself, apply sunscreen to any exposed areas (like your hands, forearms, and face) before getting into your car, especially in the spring and summer months, says Anthony Mancini, M.D., head of pediatric dermatology at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. If you're buying a new car, consider one with tinted windows, which keep out almost four times more UVA light than regular ones.

Ellie Sanders, four, was born with a rare condition called hemifacial microsomia which affects the development of the lower half of the face. It left her with just one functioning ear, meaning she desperately needs a special device to allow her to hear her teachers clearly on her first day of school in September. Ellie Sanders, (pictured with mother, Kelly) 4, was born without a right ear and has hearing loss meaning she will struggle to hear her teachers when she starts school in September . Her mother Kelly, 31, applied for the bone anchored hearing aid implant (Baha) which transmits sound directly through the skull and reaches the inner ear. But she says Ellie is the victim of a \u2018postcode lottery\u2019 with two NHS trusts arguing about who should pay the \u00a33,000 bill. While other children elsewhere in Britain get the aid Ellie, from Truro, Cornwall, faces starting school without one.

House Democrats remained undecided Friday on whether they would join a select committee created by majority Republicans to investigate the Benghazi terror attack. The chamber's Democratic leader, Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, described a split in her caucus over the matter in remarks to reporters that lambasted Republicans for what she called a \"political stunt,\" \"subterfuge\" and a \"diversionary tactic.\" Options under consideration include participating as a minority bloc, which Republicans have proposed; having a lone member take part to register disapproval but maintain a presence, or rejecting the entire process as a partisan witch hunt. \"The question is what are the terms under which Democrats can participate,\" Pelosi said, citing the need for her side to concur with any committee decision to issue subpoenas. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said it was Democrats who have to decide what to do. \"The ball is in their court,\" said the aide, Michael Steel. However, a letter from Pelosi to Boehner later Friday rejected the GOP stance as \"fundamentally unfair\" and said it would politicize the process. Boehner, meanwhile, used a glitzy Twitter post akin to a concert or pro-wrestling poster to announce the seven Republicans to serve on the new panel chaired by GOP Rep.

        [
            "(CNN) -- Nearly a month has passed since a joint Honduran-U.S. drug raid fired upon a riverboat that survivors say was carrying civilians, not traffickers. Four were killed, including two pregnant women. The mission -- carried out aboard helicopters owned by the U.S. State Department and with support of Drug Enforcement Administration agents -- laid bare the reach of U.S. involvement in Honduran security missions, as well as its associated risks. The apparent error stirred some local outrage, but the sentiment did not spread to the capital. The Honduran government, publicly at least, has not reprimanded the United States for any role it may have had, or said anything about reconsidering its cooperation arrangement. It contrasts what is seen when civilians are killed in Pakistan, for instance, where tensions between the two nations are inflamed. Or, closer to home, imagine if Mexican security forces killed civilians in an operation with any level of U.S. support, said Christopher Sabatini, senior director of policy at the Americas Society/Council of the Americas. There would be people in the streets protesting and visible outrage, he said. The relatively muted reaction in Honduras to the May 11 incident in the country's Mosquitia region, reveals much about the Central American country's relationship with the United States and the dire security situation it faces, experts said. Honduras has the highest per capita homicide rate in the world; it was 82.1 per 100,000 residents in 2011. It is also becoming a hotspot for drug trafficking, as Mexican cartels push their operations south of their own border because of increased enforcement in their country. The boat shooting was part of the response to these problems. Hilda Lezama, the owner of the boat that was attacked, says she was transporting 13 passengers before dawn on the morning of May 11 on a river near the town of Ahuas, when the helicopters appeared overhead. Her boat was nearing the landing, and she had never had problems on this route in 26 years, so she..."

Dr. Rohack called 2009 \"the year we need to have affordable health insurance coverage for all Americans.\" Dr. J. James Rohack told CNN the AMA supports an \"American model\" that includes both \"a private system and a public system, working together.\" In May, the AMA told a Senate committee it did not support a government-sponsored public health insurance option. \"The AMA does not believe that creating a public health insurance option ... is the best way to expand health insurance coverage and lower costs across the health care system,\" the organization wrote, explaining that a public insurance plan could lead to \"an explosion of costs that would need to be absorbed by taxpayers.\" Rohack, who recently became AMA president, suggested Wednesday that the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program available to Congress members and other federal employees could be expanded as a public option. That would avoid having to create a new program from scratch, he said. \"If it's good enough for Congress, why shouldn't it be good enough for individuals who don't have health insurance provided by their employers?\" Rohack said. He said AMA opposed expanding Medicare coverage for senior citizens into a broader general public plan, noting the plan is \"going broke\" and fails to cover the costs of participating doctors. His comments come as President Obama is pressing Congress to push through a comprehensive bill to reform the nation's ailing health care system this year.

For sure, as a Muslim, I am offended by those who recklessly and purposely denigrate my faith and those who share my faith. Certainly, some of the protesters represent the unemployed, the abused and the just plain forgotten in Arab and Islamic states that have been ruled by autocrats enjoying the patronage of Western governments. It is also an obvious point for anyone living in this part of the world that virulent anti-Americanism is a driving force for what is happening today. U.S. policy in the region has bequeathed a fatal breakdown in trust between successive American administrations and Arabs and Muslims. An unjust and illegal Iraq war, a \"war on terror\" that spawned a whole new drone industry, Washington's double standards in promoting human rights in the region and its unflagging support for Israel in spite of an expanding occupation in Palestine have all contributed to that legacy. As Arab states undergo a historic transformation, this breakdown in trust is having a devastating effect as the Obama administration wrestles with the right thing to do.

            "LONDON, England (CNN) -- There is a mathematical reason why the French Open is so different to any other of the Grand Slam tennis tournaments. Clay courts require a different type of game to grass and hard court surfaces . The Roland Garros tournament is currently being contested, with Rafael Nadal looking for his fifth win in a row, and world number two Roger Federer searching for his first ever French Open title. \u2022 Get the latest French Open news . What has brought problems to Federer, and to other greats like Pete Sampras and Boris Becker -- who never won a French Open, is the clay surface on which it is contested. The maths of the clay surface are distinctly different to grass or hard-court surfaces. All officially recognized courts have a court pace rating (CPR), which rates the \"speed\" of the court -- and clay courts are at the bottom. The crushed-brick mixture that constitutes the base of a clay court produces a the highest bounce and most friction of the three surfaces, meaning they have the lowest CPR of all three surface types and are considered as the \"slowest\". Grass courts are generally have the highest CPR numbers, and are the \"fastest\" courts. The CPR numbers give a hint as to whether a ball will bounce higher or lower on a specific surface, and how much friction there is to either slow the ball or allow it to skid on. An example court pace rating for each surface may be 23 for a clay court, 35 for a hard court and 46 for a grass court. \u2022 Try our special interactive to see how tennis ball bounce on different surfaces \u00bb . This number is calculated by considering both horizontal speed and vertical bounce of a tennis ball off a court. The equation used is CPR = SPR + 150 x (0.81-e). To make more sense of this, the International Tennis Federation, the game's law-makers, have produced a chart which simply matches the coefficient of friction (friction) and coefficient of restitution (bounce) to produce a court pace rating. But it's not just the bounce and speed of the ball off the clay surface that..."

Junior staffers see a side of their \"principal\"\u2014Washington-speak for boss\u2014that others do not. Being a special assistant involves a wide swath of activities: couriering papers, sitting in on meetings and delving into some policy issues.

She always asks people at all levels what they think; she's not concerned with hierarchy or status, just ideas. You see this in her strategy meetings, which always involve staff at all levels.

A Cairo court granted bail to Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed pending a retrial on charges that they supported the banned Muslim Brotherhood. Their colleague Peter Greste, who was convicted with them, was freed about two weeks ago and deported to his native Australia. Fahmy, a dual citizen of Egypt and Canada, posted about U.S. $ 33,000 in bail. Mohamed, an Egyptian citizen, was not required to pay but is barred from leaving the country before the retrial on February 23. \"Baher is home and with his family,\" said his wife, Jihan Rashed. Their employer applauded the decision to grant them bail Thursday, but said it was not enough. \"Bail is a small step in the right direction, and allows Baher and Mohamed to spend time with their families after 411 days apart,\" Al Jazeera  said. \"The focus, though, is still on the court reaching the correct verdict at the next hearing by dismissing this absurd case and releasing both these fine journalists unconditionally.\" The three were arrested in Egypt in December 2013, accused of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and broadcasting footage that portrayed the regime falsely with the intention of bringing it down. They have consistently denied the charges or any ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, saying they were only doing their jobs. Last year, all three were convicted on charges that included conspiring with the Brotherhood, spreading false news and endangering national security. Greste and Fahmy were sentenced to seven years in prison and Mohamed to 10 years. The three appealed their convictions. In January, Egypt's highest court granted them a retrial. Rights groups have held that they were pawns in a geopolitical dispute between Egypt and Qatar, the small Middle Eastern country that sponsors Al Jazeera.

As a teenage illustrator from the British mining town of Durham, Peyton was captured by World War II German forces while drawing maps of the north African desert for the Intelligence Corps. Yet amid the horrors of his prison camp - the 91-year-old recalls eating Nazi guard dogs that had been clubbed to death - Peyton carved a unique space for laughter by drawing wry, darkly humorous cartoons. Published in a prisoner-run newspaper, the drawings poked fun at camp life, offering Peyton a distraction from the everyday brutality and his fellow inmates a rare source of joy. They would also spark the beginnings of a career spanning seven decades, more than 20 books and the birth of an unusual new genre in illustration - nautical cartooning. It's a genre that Peyton has dominated for 70 years, amassing followers across the world with his trademark, roughly scribbled drawings of rain-sodden sailors naively headed for impending doom. If the leap from a 1942 prison camp to hopeless yachtsmen lost at sea seems huge, Peyton has the answer: \"The secret to cartoons is you always need something going wrong.\" Following the war, the then 24-year-old continued sketching his droll observations of everyday life. But it wasn't until Peyton bought a boat in his late 20s, setting up a business offering charter cruises, that he began to turn his illustrations to sailing. Now a retrospective of his work - \"The World of Peyton\" - published this week, features 150 of his favorite sketches. Read related: 'Queen of yachting' captures sailing's golden era on film .

            "(CNN) -- India has long been cited as one of the fastest growing economies in the world, but it hasn't always been the most hospitable place for business travelers. Ranked 132 out of 185 on the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index, the country is often viewed as a hassle by executives. Part of the problem is that India has grown faster than its infrastructure. \"Infrastructure that we created for 2020 are already getting filled up by 2012,\" says Amitabh Kant, the man who is planning to bring India up to speed by 2017. Kant already revolutionized his country once. The instigator of the \"Incredible India\" campaign, he polished India's flagging tourism image and turned it into a must-visit destination for the discerning traveler. Marketing aside, the campaign made sure journeying through the subcontinent was met with relative ease. Roads were repaved, landmarks rebuffed and the sector as a whole was trained to work with foreign guests. Today, the country sees 6.8 million overseas tourists annually. Now he is tackling what may be India's most ambitious infrastructure project to date. The Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, a $90 billion state-run enterprise, will involve connecting the 932 mile stretch between Delhi and Mumbai with new ports, airports, highways and rail links. For Kant, though, the real achievement will be the undertaking's economic knock-on effect. \"The train opens up a completely new route for India,\" he explains. \"It opens up the heart of six states, and what it does is really drive manufacturing. It creates seven new industrial cities of India,\" he explains. The country has already seen several new cities develop on the outskirts of industry centers. Outside of Delhi, for example, sits Gurgaon, a 30 year old suburb with a GDP that has started to match its next-door neighbor's. Unfortunately, many key urban features like adequate power and sewage are only just starting to be built. \"The city is doing some retro fitting,\" admits Kant. \"You are seeing power lines coming up, you are seeing..."

        "Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?\n\nArticle: Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- American voters need to decide what they really want from Washington. On the one hand, voters are dismissive of presidential and congressional candidates who can be called \"flip-floppers,\" people who shift positions or agree to compromise. On the other hand, voters rail against a dysfunctional Washington that seems unable to reach agreement on almost anything because politicians on the right and left don't seem willing to compromise . As a result, the approval ratings of Congress have fallen to only 9%. Voters insist they want the type of candidate who won't compromise, and thus won't be able to cut the deals that are needed to break through the partisan gridlock. Indeed, the term flip-flopper has become one of the dirtiest words in American politics. When candidates have a record that reveals inconsistencies in their position, their opponents pounce. In 2004, President George W. Bush's campaign eviscerated Democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry through a devastating campaign that focused on this point. In one television ad, Republicans showed Kerry windsurfing, arguing that this was a metaphor for his approach to politics. The narrator stated: \"In which direction would John Kerry lead? Kerry voted for the Iraq war, opposed it, supported it and now opposes it again. ... John Kerry: whichever way the wind blows.\" Right now the top candidates in both parties are viewed by many voters as flip-floppers. For some liberal Democrats, one of the biggest problems with President Obama has been that he has governed too much like President Bill Clinton. Rather than standing on principle, he has made deals. The president has consistently reached out to centrists and has been willing to accept the best that he could get, rather than challenging his opponents to a tough fight. On the other side of the aisle, there is former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the front-runner who Republicans love to hate. His critics argue he is a politician willing to stand for anything that will get...",

Football's world governing body has given dispensation to Kosovo to participate in friendly games against its 208 member states after repeatedly blocking previous requests for recognition. Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, is not a member of the United Nations -- despite being recognized by 90 countries -- or UEFA, which governs European football. It has been under U.N. administration and patrolled by NATO troops since a 1999 bombing campaign that halted a Serb-led campaign against Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. FIFA president Sepp Blatter told the organization's executive committee in Budapest that the decision would bring Kosovo into line with other Balkan countries and put it on the path to full membership. But the Football Association of Serbia (FSS) reacted angrily, posting a statement on its official website that spoke of the \"negative and harmful effects\" the ruling could have. \"We strongly protest the decision by FIFA's executive committee to allow the world soccer governing body's members to play friendly matches with the so-called national team of the so-called Republic of Kosovo,\" the FSS said. \"The decision made behind closed doors in Budapest without any consultations with either UEFA or the Serbian Football Association blatantly contravenes the FIFA statutes. \"Hence we will ask for an urgent meeting with FIFA President Sepp Blatter and his UEFA counterpart Michel Platini to demand a reverse of this unjustified decision which could have far-reaching consequences across the region.\" But in reply, FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke invited the Serbian FA to a meeting at the ruling body's headquarters in Zurich to discuss the ramifications.

Roanoke County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Judge Philip Trompeter found probable cause during a preliminary hearing for Jeffrey Scott Easley, who is accused of taking the girl across the country before being spotted outside a San Francisco supermarket. The judge also denied Easley's bond request, Roanoke County spokeswoman Teresa Hall said. Theresa Shanley in December spotted Easley, 32, and the girl outside a Safeway store in the Richmond district of San Francisco, then alerted police. Easley was subsequently arrested on abduction charges, as well as counts of credit card theft and credit card fraud. He waived extradition. Roanoke County Police Chief Ray Lavinder has said Easley is a \"very good suspect\" in the murder of Tina Smith, the mother of the girl he allegedly abducted. No one has been charged in the 41-year-old woman's death. For now, only the abduction charge will go to the April 1 grand jury, Hall said. Easley's attorney, Thomas W. Roe Jr., said his client will contest any and all allegations. Prosecutors are awaiting the return of DNA laboratory results before proceeding with any charges in Tina Smith's death, Hall said.

Nearly 100 protesters at UC campuses have been arrested over the past two days in the demonstrations over a 32 percent tuition increase. The demonstrators, students and nonstudents alike, were cited for trespassing, spokeswoman Claire Holmes told CNN. Holmes said those arrested would be cited and released rather than taken to jail, per agreement with student leaders. Three students were arrested earlier at Berkeley in the wake of protests across several campuses that have shaken up the University of California system a day after officials approved a tuition increase to be enacted over the next two school years. University officials said the $505 million to be raised by the tuition increases is needed to prevent even deeper cuts than those already made because of California's persistent financial crisis. Protesting students said the hike will hurt working and middle-class students who benefit from state-funded education. The first tuition hike, which takes effect in January, will raise undergraduate tuition to $8,373. The second hike kicks in next fall, raising tuition to $10,302, said university spokeswoman Leslie Sepuka. Students who live on campus could pay up to an estimated $17,200 in additional fees that include the annual cost of books and housing, according to the system's July 2008 finance guide. The January increase of about 15 percent is more than double the average public university tuition hike last year. On average, tuition and fees at four-year public universities nationwide increased 6.5 percent, or to $7,020, since the previous school year, according to data from College Board.

But even today, as in the past, Christians are being persecuted for their faith and even tortured and executed.

        "In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?\n\nArticle: (CNN) -- French peacekeepers in war-torn Ivory Coast were in control of the airport in the main city of Abidjan, the French Ministry of Defense said Sunday, as a battle for the city seemed to be looming. An additional 350 French troops joined the United Nations peacekeeping mission overnight, the ministry added. There were about 7,500 troops already in the country under the U.N. mandate. United Nations helicopters and French forces patrolled the skies over the city, as a tense calm reigned Sunday morning, a local resident told CNN. The uneasy peace came in the wake of claims of a massacre as fighters backing internationally recognized President Alassane Ouattara battle forces loyal to Laurent Gbagbo, who refuses to leave office. Foreign journalists reported being targeted and scrutinized. A group of journalists from the French TV channel France 2 were fired on by Gbagbo's forces when they tried to leave the Novotel hotel in Abidjan, according to the channel and two journalists who, to protect their security, did not want their names used. Since then, Gbagbo forces have been patrolling the hotel premises, preventing foreign journalists staying there from leaving, the sources said. One resident, whom CNN is not naming to protect his safety, said he had been to church as usual, where another parishioner said he had seen dead bodies by the road on his way to the congregation. A journalist in the city said many people were afraid to leave their homes, but were being forced to venture out to get water. Seyi Rhodes, who is staying at a hotel in Abidjan, said people were risking being shot in order to get to a water pump near the hotel. He saw French journalists come under fire, as they drove through the city, he said. Much of the city has no electricity, he added, calling it \"a really crude tactic to get people out on the streets.\" The United Nations moved about 200 personnel within the country for their own safety, as the situation got worse, spokesman Nick Birnback said Sunday. \"Peacekeepers and staff have been...",

            "Washington (CNN) -- A BP official says a gusher of oil pouring from its damaged Gulf of Mexico well could be shut off as early as next week. BP Managing Director Bo Dudley said Thursday night the company will pump fluids into the well this weekend in the beginning of a process that -- if successful -- could lead to the leak finally being closed off in a matter of days. \"If that option doesn't work, we've got a second and a third option we'll do after that,\" Dudley said on CNN's Larry King on Thursday. \"We're hopeful that next week we'll be able to shut it off.\" Earlier in the day, BP acknowledged that the underwater gusher is bigger than estimated to date, as new video showed a cloud of crude billowing around its undersea siphon. Company spokesman Mark Proegler said Thursday that the siphon is now drawing about 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons) per day up to a ship on the surface of the Gulf -- as much as government and company officials had estimated the spill was pouring into the Gulf every day for a month. Proegler declined to estimate how much more oil was escaping. BP America Chairman Lamar McKay said Wednesday that the figure used by the oil spill response team had a degree of \"uncertainty\" built into it. But figures by independent researchers have run up to many times higher: Steve Wereley, a professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University, told CNN's \"American Morning\" that the spill could be as big as 20,000 to 100,000 barrels a day. And members of Congress released video from the company that showed much more oil pouring out of the damaged well than the siphon was capturing. Rep. Ed Markey, who leads a House subcommittee investigating the disaster, told reporters, \"I think now we are beginning to understand that we cannot trust BP.\" \"People do not trust the experts any longer,\" said Markey, D-Massachusetts. \"BP has lost all credibility. Now the decisions will have to be made by others, because it is clear that they have been hiding the actual consequences of this spill.\" Meanwhile, the Coast..."

        "Summarise the article:\n\n(Kaiser Health News) -- A decade ago, almost all doctors kept paper charts on every patient. That is changing quickly as laptops become as common as stethoscopes in exam rooms. Recent hacking attacks have raised questions about how safe that data may be. Here are some frequently asked questions about this evolution underway in American medicine, and the government programs sparking the change. Are my medical records stored electronically? At least some of the information you share with your doctor or any hospital or clinic where you've been treated is probably stored on a computer. It's pretty common for most hospitals, clinics and doctors' offices to digitally store your basic information including your name, address and insurance company, the same way many retailers do. It's also likely that at least some information about your specific medical conditions is linked to that data. Health care providers have been using computers to help them get paid for decades. That means many computer-generated bills sent to you and/or your insurance company contain medical details like the conditions you were treated for, prescriptions and referrals to specialists. Where things are really changing quickly is in the use of electronic records for day-to-day patient care. Until recently, most doctors used paper charts to record information generated during patient visits. But the 2009 economic stimulus package offered doctors and hospitals tens of thousands of dollars to help buy computers and software designed to replace paper charts. Adoption was slow at first, but as of June most hospitals and close to half of all doctors in America report that they are using systems that qualify for those payments. Some are aggressively digitizing older records stored on paper; others are not. Does the Affordable Care Act require doctors and hospitals to use electronic medical records? No. The stimulus package, which pre-dates Obamacare, offers doctors, hospitals and some other health providers money to help them upgrade from paper to...",

        [
            "Jackson, Georgia (CNN) -- Troy Davis, whose case drew international attention, was put to death by lethal injection for the 1989 killing of an off-duty police officer in Savannah, Georgia, prison officials announced Wednesday night. Davis was defiant to the very end. After he was strapped to the death gurney, he lifted his head to address the family of the slain officer. He told the family of Mark MacPhail that he was not responsible for the officer's death and did not have a gun at the time, according to execution witnesses. Davis said the case merited further investigation, talking fast as officials prepared to give him the lethal cocktail. The execution followed the U.S. Supreme Court's rejection of a stay, allowing the state to proceed. Davis was declared dead at 11:08 p.m. ET. Throughout the day, Davis' lawyers and high-profile supporters had asked the state and various courts to intervene, arguing he did not murder MacPhail in 1989. Davis initially had been scheduled to die by lethal injection at 7 p.m. ET. But the proceeding was delayed more than three hours as the justices pondered a plea filed by his attorney. Several hundred people, most of them opposing the proceeding, gathered outside the state prison in Jackson where Davis, 42, awaited his fate. Others held a vigil in a nearby church. The inmate's sister, Martina Davis-Correia, was among those who held a vigil outside the prison. Before the U.S. Supreme Court's decision, she said officials needed to take more time to examine the case. \"When you are looking at someone's life, you can't press rewind.\" More than 100 officers, many in riot gear, stood guard over the largely-quiet gathering, which featured candles, occasional prayers and songs. At least three people who crossed the street had been taken away in handcuffs. \"Tonight the state of Georgia legally lynched an innocent man,\" Davis' lawyer Thomas Ruffin Jr. said. \"Tonight I witnessed something tragic.\" Davis' supporters, who also rallied outside the U.S. Supreme Court building, argued that..."

        "Extract key points from the article based on which the stock market could react:\n\nBy . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . A team of British scientists has discovered tunnels that are almost as tall as the Eiffel Tower under an ice shelf in Antarctica. Researchers from a number of UK universities and the British Antarctic Survey - a research centre based on the continent - detected the tunnels when they flew a plane over the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in West Antarctica. Radar from the plane, as well as satellite photos, revealed that ridges and cavities on the surface of the ice sheet corresponded to tunnels lying at its base. British scientists discovered the tunnel using radar from the specially-modified plane. It revealed that ridges and cavities on the surface of the ice corresponded to 820-foot-high tunnels hidden at the base of the sheet . The 820-foot tunnels are nearly as tall as the Eiffel Tower - which measures just over 987 feet - and more than four times as tall as Tower Bride - which comes in at 213 feet. Researchers concluded that the placement of the tunnels means that they were most likely  formed from meltwater - water released from melting ice - that flowing underneath the ice sheet, over land, and into the ocean. The data revealed that water moved beneath the ice in concentrated channels, similar to rivers. Scientists previously thought that meltwater flowed underneath ice sheets in more evenly-spread, thin, continuous sheets. Researchers used a specially-modified Twin Otter aircraft to make the discovery. The plane, designed to operate in remote environment, was fitted with remote sensors that provided scientists with data on the land, ice and sea that it flew over. Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey Base and researchers from a number of UK universities made the discovery at the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in West Antarctica.

            "(CNN) -- Kay and Mike Alexander's journey to obesity is a familiar road for many married couples. Neither was overweight when they met on a coffee break at work. Nor were they obese when they cut their wedding cake, iced with an image of Star Trek's USS Enterprise. But over time, working and raising foster children in Kalamazoo, Michigan, the pounds added up. \"I put on about five to 10 pounds per year for 20 years,\" Kay Alexander says. At age 55, she says she was \"one blood test away from being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes,\" when she started having chest pains. Remembering that her father died of a heart attack when he was only 55, she went to the hospital. There, a doctor told her she too had had a heart attack -- one that, without medical attention, would have left her with only hours to live. \"That was the big trigger,\" she says. At 5 feet, 4 inches tall, she was closing in on 300 pounds. She knew she had to lose weight, but also knew from experience that dieting wasn't the answer. Her husband, whose body mass index had increased from 23 to 34 since graduating college, agreed. So instead of cutting their portion sizes down to starvation rations, the Alexanders decided to rely on their training as chemical engineers. They began tinkering with recipes to see if they could reduce the calorie counts of their favorite foods. \"We put our food on a diet,\" says Kay Alexander. \"Dilution is the solution to pollution. That (theory) doesn't work for environmental engineering in the long run, but does work for food.\" The Alexanders' strategy is a powerful one, says Rachel Berman, director of nutrition for Caloriecount.com, a site Kay Alexander used to calculate calorie totals for her new recipes. Berman, also a registered dietician, uses the Alexanders' approach in counseling and has seen patients experiment with it in their homes. \"Deprivation does not work in the long run,\" she says. \"And Kay and Mike are a great example of how to turn this into a lifestyle change.\" It took four or five months of experimenting to..."

        "Summarise the article:\n\n(CNN) -- Android continues to dominate in the battle to be the top smartphone system in the world, thanks in part to Samsung, which reigned as the top phone manufacturer for 2012. Android grew its already significant chunk of the smartphone market to 68.8% last year, while Apple's iOS operating system stayed comfortably in second place with 18.8% of smartphone shipments, according to new stats from research firm IDC. Together, the two operating systems accounted for 87.6% of all new smartphones in 2012, leaving struggling competitors BlackBerry and Windows far behind. It's no surprise that Android has surged so far ahead of iOS. There are are thousands of Android handset models in every size and at every price imaginable, while Apple has released only six versions of the iPhone. Apple sold 130 million smartphones last year, according to Gartner. \"Even with the Apple Maps debacle, iPhone owners were not deterred from purchasing new iPhones,\" said IDC research manager Ramon Llamas in a statement. Apple released one new iOS phone in 2012, the much-anticipated iPhone 5. However, according to Gartner it was previous iPhone models, which dropped in price enough to make them a more appealing option in emerging markets, that accounted for much of Apple's smartphone success. Even though Apple's sales are growing, IDC points out that its year-over-year growth is actually slower when compared with the rest of the smartphone market. Samsung sold 384.6 million phones in 2012, only 53.5% of which were smartphones, according to Gartner. Chinese phone maker Huawei climbed to the No.3 smartphone vendor spot in the final quarter of 2012. Nokia has been struggling and 2013 will be a key year for the company. Its fate is largely tied to that of Windows Phone 8, which runs on Nokia's latest Lumia phones. Both BlackBerry and Windows are compteting to win over smartphone customers with their new offerings.

Julio Acevedo, 44, was arrested after a friend helped facilitate his surrender in the crowded parking lot of a mini mart in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, said Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne of the New York Police Department. The friend, Derrick Hamilton, traveled with detectives and a deputy U.S. marshal to the site. Acevedo was given a description of unmarked police cars to look for when surrendering, Browne said. Police said Acevedo was cooperative and was taken to a Pennsylvania State Police barracks to await extradition proceedings. He was arrested at 5:10 p.m. Video of the surrender, shot by CNN affiliates WFMZ and WABC and posted on their websites, showed Acevedo in a light blue hooded sweatshirt, his hands uncuffed, being helped out of a gray sedan and put into a silver SUV. Hamilton helped arrange for Acevedo to speak to reporters by phone Tuesday. During that call, Acevedo said he was trying to get away from someone shooting at him when he crashed, according to WABC. Police say Acevedo was going about 60 miles per hour early Sunday when the BMW he was driving crashed into the side of a livery cab carrying Nathan and Raizy Glauber, both 21. Raizy Glauber was pregnant; she and her husband were going to the hospital because she wasn't feeling well, said her cousin, Sarah Gluck. The couple's baby boy was delivered by cesarean section from his dead mother's womb but died the next day, police said. The driver of the cab survived. The front of the BMW was smashed but the black Toyota Camry cab was left a mangled wreck.

VBS.TV is the broadband television network of VICE. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe that this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Viewer discretion advised. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- The first time I heard anything about people living in the sewers in Colombia was back at the beginning of the '90s. The sewage system running under Bogota's streets was filled with packs of kids living waist-deep in human waste and taking in copious amounts of glue and crack in order to cope. This was at the height of Colombia's Dirty War, and the whole reason street kids had moved into the sewers in the first place was to get away from the violence above ground. But then the paramilitary death squads who had chased them off the street started coming into the pipes and shooting them or dousing them in gasoline or raping them. The sewer kids became a fairly big humanitarian story in the media for a while, with networks in America and Europe sending in TV crews to cover it and folks setting up charities abroad. Then, as happens with news stories, it fell off the radar, and I guess people kind of thought the problem had been resolved, if they thought of it at all. But what had actually happened was, about six months after all the stories aired, the death squads went in, armed with the whereabouts of the sewer-kid hot spots, and carried out massive reprisal killings. There was some talk in the government about cracking down on the death squads, but by all accounts, soldiers and off-duty cops made up a good part of most squads. So the situation just stagnated while the world turned its attention elsewhere. See the rest of Sewers of Bogota at VBS.TV . When we went into the sewers and started...",

They've got the wrong philosophy, but they're willing to die for what they believe, while we are busily giving away every belief and every value for the sake of political correctness,\" he said during his speech at the RNC's winter meeting. \"We have to change that.\" Carson acknowledged his comments were likely to spark controversy and gain headlines, but he preemptively dismissed the press attention. \"They are just so ridiculous,\" he said, to laughter from the crowd. The remarks are similar to ones he made previously, likening the United States government to Nazi Germany in that both, he argued, worked to silence their opponents. Carson stood by those comments when pressed in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. It's that very penchant \u2014 for frank and often controversial comments \u2014 that has made him so popular with the GOP base, and turned the retired neurosurgeon into a rising conservative star who just last month polled third in a CNN/ORC survey of the potential GOP presidential field. He's made no secret of his interest in the race, and recently said he \"feel[s] fingers\" from God to run. Many within the establishment wing of the party remain wary of him, however, because of his talent for the very remarks that make him so popular with the far right. He also started a firestorm of criticism over comments he made that Obamacare was the \"worst thing\" to happen to the U.S. since slavery. But his appearance at the RNC's winter meeting, alongside the likes of Wisconsin Gov.

While they're inevitable in many ways, people don't inevitably have to die because of them. That line of thinking is being raised following Washington state's disaster in Snohomish County, where at least 17 people died and 49 structures were destroyed after a fast-moving landslide buried a square mile in up to 40 feet of mud. After a smaller landslide struck the same area in 2006, officials invested millions of dollars to reduce the hazards, and residents felt safe, Snohomish County Emergency Management Director John Pennington contended this week. \"We really did a great job of mitigating,\" he told reporters. Officials and many residents have long known they live in landslide country, Pennington said. He cited how a 2010 Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan contains a chapter warning about the same land mass that collapsed a week ago.

Some experts and residents of Oso, Washington, now take sharp exception with Pennington. As rescue teams still seek survivors in the mud almost a week later, the disaster prompts new questions about how the local government allowed homes and a community to remain in the path of a potential landslide -- a peril that was highlighted as recently as 1999 in a Seattle-based geomorphologist's report to the Army Corps of Engineers. Landslides are as endemic to the area as earthquakes are to California, experts say. Last week's landslide occurred on the lush western slopes of the Cascades, where dense forests of 150-foot firs are drenched with 120 inches of rain a year, sprouting a biomass greater than the Amazon rain forests', said Ralph Haugerud of the U.S. Geological Survey's Seattle office. \"This is a valley lined with landslides, going back 14,000 years when the glaciers left,\" Haugerud said. \"And before that there weren't any landslides because it was submerged...",

He was 60. The former intelligence officer, who had suffered from prostate cancer, will be buried Monday, according to a Libyan foreign ministry spokesman. Al Megrahi's cousin, Omer al-Gharyani, told CNN he was at a Tripoli hospital with al Megrahi when he died. His death came more than two-and-a-half years after he was freed from a life sentence in Scotland because he was said to be dying. His brother said the family refers \"to the deceased as 'the convicted innocent.'\" \"May God bless his soul,\" he added. Relatives of those killed in the bombing expressed relief and, in some cases, anger. \"He was a mass murderer. I feel no pity,\" said Susan Cohen, whose daughter was among the 189 Americans killed. Lockerbie victims' families: Relief, anger . The destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 was the deadliest act of air terrorism targeting Americans until the September 11, 2001, attacks, according to the FBI. American and British investigators who painstakingly pieced together the wreckage concluded it was destroyed by a bomb. Authorities in those nations claimed al Megrahi -- once the security chief for Libyan Arab Airlines -- and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah were Libyan intelligence agents who planted the explosive. They were charged in November 1991 on 270 counts of murder and conspiracy to murder. That indictment set off the first battle over al Megrahi, until Libya handed him and Fhima over in the face of international pressure. Eight years after his trial and conviction, a fresh uproar arose when he was released from a Scottish prison because he was battling terminal prostate cancer. He received a hero's welcome upon arriving home in Libya.

The bomb went off at Jai Hospital's reception area, said Brij Lal, spokesman for Uttar Pradesh police. The hospital is about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from the famed Taj Mahal, India's most popular tourist destination. The blast blew out window panes and damaged the hospital's waiting room, where the three injured people were, said P.K. Tiwari, the inspector general of police in Agra. One of them sustain burn injuries. \"It is difficult to say what the cause and motive of the blast were. But we know that this was not a sophisticated device and seems to have not created too much impact,\" Tiwari said. \"My guess is this is a crude bomb.\" Police at the scene said they spotted several unclaimed lunch boxes and bicycles near the blast site. India's Home Ministry said it had dispatched commandos to Agra and was in the process of collecting evidence from the scene. The Agra blast occurred a day after Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned the nation's senior police officers about India's vulnerability. \"The security environment in the country continues to be uncertain,\" Singh said in remarks at a police conference Friday. \"The recent terrorist attacks in Mumbai and Delhi are grim reminders of the grave challenges posed by terrorism to our national security.\" India has suffered a spate of attacks in recent years, including the November 2008 siege of Mumbai that killed 163 people. This month, a bomb inside a briefcase at the high court in the capital, New Delhi, killed 11 people and injured 74 others. The Islamic extremist group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami claimed responsibility for that attack in an e-mail to several TV news channels. Authorities have detained three suspects from the Kashmir region. In July, 19 people were killed in three deadly blasts in Mumbai, India's largest city and financial hub.

A gaping hole is evidence of the U.S. firepower. Insurgents used the layered and intricate labyrinth of passageways and hatches to carry out summary trials and executions. The police show us clothing and shoes, saying they are leaving them in place in case the families of the victims decide to come back. The stench of decay still lingers.

            "Bur Gabo, Somalia (CNN) -- We had tried for weeks to get access to Kenya's incursion into lawless Somalia. The go finally came from the Kenyan military in a text message late one Saturday night. We're told to be at the Nairobi's military airbase before dawn. \"Bring our own flak jackets,\" we were told. In October, the Kenya defense forces surprised many by sweeping into Somalia to take on Al Shabaab, an Islamic militant group bent on overthrowing the weak transitional government. At first, the \"spin\" by generals and politicians was that it was a swift reaction to punish Al Shabaab for its suspected involvement in a series of kidnappings. But peering through the window of a rattling Mi-8 transport chopper, it is clear that what soldiers and security analysts have been telling us is true. The combat base on the Kenyan side of the border is well established -- an area of cleared ground dotted with orderly rows of tents and military hardware -- including artillery pieces. It's obvious the soldiers here have have been preparing for some time. This is no rescue posse thrown together. Kenya aims to obliterate Al Shabaab. \"The reason for this campaign is to liberate the locals here from the rule of the Al Shabaab,\" Major Seif Said Rashid tells me, several magazines of ammo in his front pockets. \"My troops are committed and they are out ready to sacrifice so that they are able to achieve the objective that has brought us here.\" The major says his biggest military challenge is that Al Shabaab's weakness is its strength. Militarily they couldn't match Kenya's firepower. But their small and mobile forces know the territory and terror. \"The war here is a blend of both conventional and asymmetrical,\" he says, \"and that poses some peculiar challenges.\" Not that the thrust of this front is being spearheaded by truly conventional forces. We are traveling with the 20th Parachute battalion -- an elite and sometimes-controversial group -- within the Kenyan army. With them are Somali militia and forces of the transitional..."

            "London (CNN) -- Charles Dickens is one of the world's best-loved writers, whose books -- and the countless film and TV adaptations they inspire -- still keep readers (and viewers) on the edge of their seats. Now, 200 years on from his birth, his genius is to be feted with a host of events marking the bicentenary of one of Britain's most famous sons. Dickens 2012 will see everything from readings to royal visits, celebrating the man who gave the world \"Oliver Twist,\" \"David Copperfield\" and \"Great Expectations.\" In London, the special events will begin with a celebrity performance, by actors Simon Callow and Joanna Lumley, at the Dickens family's graves in Highgate Cemetery on Monday. And on Tuesday, the anniversary of Dickens' birth, the Prince of Wales will lay a wreath at Dickens' grave in Poet's Corner, Westminster Abbey, while actor Ralph Fiennes, Dickens' biographer Claire Tomalin and the author's great-great-grandson, Mark Dickens give readings. There are more commemorations planned across the country, and around the world, so what is Dickens' secret? And why, above all others, is his work still revered, so many years after his death? Clare Pettitt, Dickens specialist at King's College London, puts his continued popularity down to his modernity. \"Everybody says this about absolutely every author ever, but Dickens really was a peculiarly modern writer, very attuned to what was new; he was writing at the beginning of the industrial revolution which, effectively, we are still in. \"He would have been fascinated by Twitter, for example -- he loved the telegraph, the railways, all sorts of modern communications technology, he was very 'on the button'.\" Adrian Wootton, co-director of the Dickens 2012 celebrations, insists that almost 150 years after his death, the \"Oliver Twist\" author still has something to say: \"Dickens is not some fusty historical figure, but still an ultra-relevant, dynamic innovator. \"He rewrote the style, form and substance of the novel; changed the process and dissemination of the..."

He didn't make it through the night. While the young boy died sometime between the night of Wednesday, September 24, and the following morning, it wasn't until Friday night that authorities figured out why: enterovirus D68, a particularly pernicious strain of an otherwise common virus that has been particularly widespread this year. While it's been detected in at least four people who died, Eli's case is the first in which authorities have definitively cited enterovirus D68 as the cause of death. Jeff Plunkett, the health officer in Eli's hometown of Hamilton Township, New Jersey, explained Saturday that, while the boy was born premature, \"he had no other existing condition\" and his parents no reason to believe he was direly ill before the virus took his life. Eli was 4. \"He was asymptomatic and fine, and the next morning he had passed,\" Plunkett told reporters. \"So the onset was very rapid, very sudden. And that's clearly the big difference (between enterovirus D68 and other enterovirus strains).\" Authorities are testing one other child who attended preschool at Eli's school, Yardville Elementary, albeit in a different class, for enterovirus D68. That boy has been treated at  Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and is now recovering at home, according to Plunkett. There are no other suspected cases in the town of 90,000 residents. Nor is there any sign of pervasive sickness at Yardville Elementary or other town schools, with attendance levels around normal. This speaks to the deadliness, the randomness and, in a sense, the pervasiveness of enterovirus D68. Hamilton Township Mayor Kelly Yaede pointed out that his parents \"nor anyone will ever be able to determine where Eli may have contracted this virus.\" \"The virus is out in the community, there is nothing we can do about that,\" the health officer said. \"The way to prevent it is from your own...",

The tiny pair were born to mother Lun Lun, a 15-year-old giant panda, at Zoo Atlanta on Monday, the first arriving at 6:21 p.m. and the second at 6:23 p.m. The zoo did not immediately know the gender of the cubs. The twins are the first for Lun Lun, who has two other offspring at Zoo Atlanta, and are the product of artificial insemination. Their father is 15-year-old Yang Yang, also a resident at Zoo Atlanta. \"We're thrilled to welcome Lun Lun's and Yang Yang's twins. This is a success we share with all of our fellow zoological organizations working to understand and protect this iconic species, and we share our joy with our local community and with our colleagues in China,\" Raymond B. King, president and CEO of Zoo Atlanta, said in a statement. The pink-colored twins -- black patches of hair will begin to appear in a week or two -- were separated shortly after birth, with one staying with Lun Lun and the other being cared for in the zoo's nursery. \"Twins are an entirely new scenario for Lun Lun, Zoo Atlanta and our animal care teams, who will no doubt be extremely busy over the next few months,\" King said. The zoo said twins typically weigh less than single-born panda cubs with a high risk of mortality. A single panda cub typically weighs just 3 to 5 ounces at birth, according to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Twins are not unusual for pandas, Zoo Atlanta said in a statement, but in the wild the mother will usually only care for one of them. That is why they were separated, but the zoo said they may rotate them in Lun Lun's care over the next few months. The public can expect to see the panda twins in the late fall, the zoo said. Their father and two brothers, Xi Lan, 4, and Po, 2, will remain on display. Fewer than 2,000 giant pandas remain on the planet, according to the Smithsonian.

The protests -- both made up largely of Shiite Muslims calling for the release of Shiite prisoners -- occurred despite a Saudi government ban on all kinds of public demonstrations. Demonstrators  in Hofuf, a city about 300 kilometers (185 miles) east of the Saudi  capital of Riyadh, began their march after Friday prayers, two activists told CNN . They asked not to be identified because of security concerns and  fear of reprisals. Three demonstrators were arrested by Saudi security forces, the activists said.

Ibrahim  al-Mugaiteeb, a Saudi human rights activist, told CNN that he saw \"no people in the streets and virtually no security presence.\" But by Friday night, about 200 people were out demonstrating near Qatif, according to a Shiite activist.

With their football counterparts qualifying for the 2010 World Cup finals with a win over Bahrain earlier on Saturday, it was left to Graham Henry's men to complete the double. But they were given a tough fight by underdogs Italy, who were inspired by an 80,000 crowd in a stadium normally reserved for Serie A giants Inter and AC Milan. Henry fielded a largely second-string team after last week's 19-12 defeat of Wales in Cardiff. Italy briefly led as former Australian rugby league international Craig Gower kicked a penalty. But New Zealand pulled ahead with two Luke McAlister penalties and Corey Flynn put them further ahead with the only try of the game after 25 minutes. McAlister landed another penalty before halftime to send the visitors into the break with a 14-3 lead. After the interval he kicked two further penalties with Gower getting his second for Italy. The All Blacks next play England, who saw off Argentina 16-9 at Twickenham in a poor quality match in difficult conditions. A late try by Matt Banahan gave Martin Johnson's men the edge and his sixth win from 13 games in charge. Fly-half star Jonny Wilkinson provided all of England's points in the first half, with a drop-goal and two penalties as the scores were tied at 9-9 at the half. Center Martin Rodriguez, one of a trio of Argentina debutants, kicked three penalties from five attempts to keep them level until the late home try. In other international action, former England coach Andy Robinson led his new Scotland team to a 23-10 win over Fiji. Johnnie Beattie and Graeme Morrison went over for tries for Scotland at Murrayfield. On Friday night, France shocked world champions South Africa 20-13 in Toulouse.

Her \"acknowledgement that the relationship between Britain and Ireland has not been entirely benign is a gross understatement,\" Gerry Adams said in a statement. The queen is on a historic four-day visit to the Republic of Ireland, the first by a British monarch since Irish independence from London 90 years ago. Adams, a pivotal figure in Northern Irish history as long-time leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, said earlier that the queen's visit was \"premature.\" But that is mild compared to incendiary language he has used in the past, according to a journalist formerly based in Ireland. \"When the queen's cousin Lord Mountbatten was killed by the IRA in 1979, (Adams) said it was an execution that was fully justified,\" Toby Harden said. Wednesday night, Queen Elizabeth expressed regret for the suffering of people on both sides. \"We can never forget those who have died or been injured, and their families. To all those who have suffered as a consequence of our troubled past, I extend my sincere thoughts and deep sympathy,\" she said. Adams said he thought her sympathy was \"genuine.\" But he said it was not enough, demanding that \"the future policy of her government (be) about building an entirely new future based on genuine equality, and mutual respect.\" The queen, who was applauded when she began her remarks Wednesday night in the Irish language, acknowledged the complex relationship between the neighbors separated by water and different cultures. On Tuesday she laid a wreath at the Dublin's Garden of Remembrance, which honors those who fought for Irish freedom from British rule. During a trip laced with historically significant gestures, the queen has visited the National War Memorial Gardens in Islandbridge and Croke Park Stadium, where British troops opened fire on a...",

Slovakia's Marek Hamsik scored in the 31st minute latching onto Juan Camilo Zuniga's cross to put the hosts ahead. The 25-year-old midfielder was also involved in the second, setting up defender Fabio Cannavaro who scored from close range a minute before the break. The win, which puts Napoli on 49 points, keeps the pressure up on Juventus who travel to Chievo on Sunday. Saturday's other game saw the mid-table clash between Torino and Sampdoria finish goalless. Roma, who crashed to a 4-2 defeat at home to Cagliari on Friday, have sacked coach Zdenek Zeman. \"AS Roma wishes to announce that Mr Zdenek Zeman has been relieved of his duties as first-team coach,\" said a statement released on the club's official website Saturday. \"The club thanks Mr Zeman and his collaborators for the professionalism and dedication shown in carrying out the job.\" Aurelio Andreazzoli will take temporary charge of the team.

George Baker, a retired salesman, had traveled from his home in Tempe, Arizona, to Lynchburg in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains for the wedding, said his son, the father of the bride. \"Several times at the reception, my daughter coaxed him out on the dance floor and I saw them one time hugging and I overheard him tell her how beautiful she looked, how happy he was for she and her husband and (how he) enjoyed the wedding service immensely,\" Gregg Baker told HLN's \"Prime News\" Thursday. He added that his father spoke that night with the pastor, telling him, \"If I die tonight, I die a happy man.\" After the ceremony, the patriarch was walking down Main Street toward a restaurant where the reception was to be held when he was attacked by the three boys in what they told police was an attempt to impress some girls, Gregg Baker said. The elderly victim was taken to a hospital, where he died Monday morning, police said.

And federal government offices in the area will be closed on Tuesday. But the snow isn't the only thing to worry about. \"We are going to see high snowfall amounts, but the ice is what is going to be the big story,\" CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray said, pointing at North Carolina. Raleigh, North Carolina, could see up to a half-inch of ice, which could knock out power and \"makes travel nearly impossible,\" she said. The bitter cold is coming from several fronts. This weekend, the Northeast weathered its fourth snowstorm in three weeks, and extremely low temperatures are predicted to hang around for two more weeks. A winter storm stretching across the Midwest and Southeast is bringing freezing rain and ice accumulation, especially from Arkansas to Tennessee. Late Monday, Tennessee declared a state of emergency as road conditions quickly deteriorated and power outages spiked. Temperatures across the eastern half of the United States will be below average for the entire week, and that's a big deal as winter fatigue sets in. In Boston, where 95 inches of snow have already been recorded this year, the latest storm was expected to skirt by and bring a few more inches, Gray said. This February is the city's snowiest month ever. Frank Ippolito, the owner of a snow removal business operating in Boston, said his staff was weary from lack of sleep. At this point, his snowplow drivers are putting snow \"anywhere and everywhere there's an open piece of land that won't obstruct the view safely of the driver or prevent someone from getting out of a doorway or moving a car,\" he said.

Instead, Christian LaBella, 25, and Lohan, 26, filed harassment claims against each other. \"Cross complaints for harassment were filed and LaBella's assault arrest was voided after detectives investigated further,\" NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said. The incident happened in a guest room at New York's Union Square W Hotel at 5 a.m., according to a police official who did not want to be named. Lohan said she and three other friends -- another woman and two men, including LaBella -- went to the room after a night of partying at a nightclub, another police source said. From there, the accounts differ. Lohan told police she asked LaBella to borrow his cell phone because her battery died, and then discovered photos he took of her at the nightclub, the source said. LaBella told police Lohan took his phone without permission and refused to give it back. When she refused to return the phone, Lohan told police that LaBella pushed her onto the bed and she suffered scratches, the source added. Lohan said she then ran out of the room and into the stairwell with LaBella in pursuit, according to the source. She accused LaBella of choking her during the struggle for the phone, the source said. Police, who responded to a fire alarm that officers said had been pulled by Lohan, arrested LaBella on two misdemeanor counts of assault and harassment based on Lohan's description of what happened. Those charges were dropped when investigators decided there was not enough evidence to support them. Both Lohan and LaBella could have difficulty pursuing competing civil claims, a police source said.

Connecticut Superior Court Judge Eliot Prescott's ruling upholds a decision by the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission to release the calls related to the December 2012 shooting. In doing so, the judge denied an application from State Attorney Stephen Sedensky to stay the commission's decision. In his ruling, Prescott grants \"the plaintiff and Newtown respondents a short period of time to attempt to obtain appellate relief from this decision.\" If no higher court grants the appeal, the 911 audio recordings will be released on December 4 at 2 p.m. ET. The massacre at Sandy Hook left 26 people dead, including 20 children, making it the second-deadliest shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Adam Lanza, shot himself at the end of his 11-minute rampage. The killings in Newtown, about 60 miles outside New York, happened less than five months after a similar bloodbath at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, outside Denver. Those mass slayings triggered a nationwide debate over gun violence, school safety and mental health, a debate that produced some new restrictions on firearms in several states. A backlash against those laws by gun-rights advocates followed, and there was only limited action on a federal level after a Republican filibuster blocked expanded background checks for gun buyers.

        "Sum the following article in brief: HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- In the decade since the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China, local movie-makers have faced daunting changes in the industry. A trend of fewer films being produced each year in Hong Kong at the time of the handover has continued into the 21st century. Stephen Chow's \"Shaolin Soccer\" is one of Hong Kong's all-time top-grossing films. People in Hong Kong's industry point to several causes for the comparatively leaner times: a lack of opportunities for new acting talent, inadequate training and schooling for people who produce movies and changing tastes within the Hong Kong public. At the same time, local film-makers have had to refocus their cameras for a new audience: mainland China. \"The Hong Kong film industry came to a rude awakening [in the late 1990s] that the world was changing faster than it was in the age of new delivery systems for home entertainment and the Internet,\" says Bede Cheng, a local film archivist and curator. \"Unfortunately, it seemed to be blinded by the 'golden age' of the '80s, where any film could easily rack in over $1.3 million.\" The box office numbers are sobering. In the early 1990s, Hong Kong released around 200 local features a year. By 1997, that number dropped to 85 films grossing $69 million, according to the Hong Kong, Kowloon and New Territories Motion Picture Industry Association (MPIA). By 2006, those figures slumped to 51 films grossing $37 million. Ten years ago, the top 10 grossing films accounted for 47 percent of the total box-office return; today, the portion is 58 percent. \"1997, unfortunately, coincides with the beginning of the collapse of the local film industry -- a well-documented fact,\" says screenwriter Jimmy Ngai. \"On the other hand, it also commenced the opening up of the mainland market. \"The result is that the industry has grown more and more accustomed to looking north for both investment and box return -- nothing political, but more of a survival instinct. What needs not to be spelt out for film-makers venturing north is that...",

A tearful Thomas Bjorn overcame the recent death of his father to shoot a superb five-under-par 65 despite difficult early conditions -- then late in the day 20-year-old amateur Tom Lewis shocked everyone by joining him at the top of the leaderboard with a record-breaking effort. The duo share a coach, but apart from that their stories could not be more different.

The Dane, 11 times a winner on the European Tour, has made the halfway cut just twice since his father passed away in May following a long illness, but at the windswept English links course he rediscovered the form that earned him two winning Ryder Cup appearances. \"Dad meant a lot to me,\" the world No. 80 told reporters before wiping tears from his eyes. \"He would have been very proud of what I did today.

Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore are both active members of the Twitter social-networking site. Moore, who was in southern France where her husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, is filming a movie, quickly replied to the threat saying, \"Hope you are joking.\" Twitter followers who saw the message tracked it to a San Jose, California, home, where police found a 48-year-old woman. The police took her into custody for a psychological evaluation, according to a police spokesman. About two hours after the initial exchange, Moore posted this message -- known as a \"tweet\" -- on Twitter: \"Thanks everyone for reaching out to the San Jose PD i am told they are aware and no need to call anymore. I do not know this woman.\" A San Jose police spokesman said a \"concerned citizen\" -- not Moore or Kutcher -- called his department at 4:37 a.m. to report seeing the threat on Twitter. Police went to the residence that the caller provided and found the woman unharmed but in need of help, Sgt. Ronnie Lopez said. \"We determined she did meet the criteria for a 72-hour psychological evaluation, and she was taken to a hospital for that treatment,\" Lopez said. Both Moore and Kutcher post tweets from their cell phones several times a day. Kutcher has 675,000 subscribers following his Twitter postings, while 380,000 have signed up to follow Moore. Twitter attracts many readers who enjoy seeing the behind-the-scenes writing, photos and video from celebrities who have embraced the social-network technology. This unusual access also allows subscribers to send messages to celebrities, who sometimes reply.

The deficit at the top after Rosberg's failure to finish in Singapore was three points. That became 10 after he struggled with the balance of his Mercedes in the wet in Japan.

While the Briton, who secured his 38th career pole on Saturday, appears to have raised his game, Rosberg has plateaued. He cannot hide from his winless stretch which now stands at five races; it has been 83 long days since he last took to the top step of the rostrum in Germany. Nico Rosberg congratulates Lewis Hamilton after he secured pole for Sunday's Russian Grand Prix . Of course, there have been poles during the interim, in Hungary, Belgium and in Japan. He also would have certainly challenged Hamilton in Singapore after finishing just seven thousandths of a second shy of his team-mate in qualifying. Yet his failure to convert any of those pole laps into victories has somewhat thwarted his chances of emulating father Keke and claiming his maiden championship win. It would be unfair and probably inaccurate, to say that the pressure is getting to the  ice-cool Rosberg. it would be daft, too, to write him off. But we should note that Hamilton has challenged for Formula One championships before, in 2007, 2008 and even in 2010. Rosberg hasn\u2019t.\u00a0Will those experiences benefit Hamilton?

Following an interview with Matt Lauer on Today -- and in preparation for her hosting gig on this weekend's \"Saturday Night Live\" -- Lohan swung by Thursday's episode of \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\" The genial Fallon asked Lohan just how, exactly, she landed the hosting gig. Lohan claimed that she'd been pestering \"SNL\" czar Lorne Michaels for a return trip to \"SNL\" for a long time. \"I kept asking him,\" she said. \"I wasn't giving up.\" Michaels apparently ran into Lohan in Los Angeles, and offered her the job on the spot: \"You know Lorne, he's very straight to the point,\" said Lohan. \"He was like, 'What about March 3?' I'm like, 'I'm free!'\" The ever-excitable Fallon was kind to the eternally beleaguered starlet, focusing his questions mostly on \"SNL\" and on her just-announced role as Elizabeth Taylor in an upcoming Lifetime movie. \"What's the name of the movie?\" asked Fallon. \"Liz and Dick,\" said Lohan, who endearingly couldn't understand why the audience immediately erupted into laughter. (Oh, get your mind out of the gutter!) From there, Fallon lightly skipped over the last eight years of Lohan's career, guiding the conversation into an mutual reminiscence about the very first \"Debbie Downer\" sketch back in 2004. If there was one awkward note in the interview, it came when Lohan asked Fallon -- apparently out of the blue -- if he'd be interested in swinging by \"SNL\" this weekend. (Fallon seemed nonplussed, and Lohan admitted she didn't know exactly what his role would be.) The actress stuck around to play a round of Pictionary. The clues included \"Pole Vaulting,\" \"Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is,\" and \"Corndog.\" (Oh, get your mind out of the gutter!) It was, in short, an undeniably pleasant interview that offered absolutely no indication whether this weekend's \"SNL\" will be a comeback event, a trainwreck, or a postmodern trainwreck comeback event.

        "Condense the article down to the essentials to present it in the form of short cards in mobile news apps:\n\nIn a David vs. Goliath battle that pitted the Federal Aviation Administration against the operator of a small model airplane, a federal administrative judge has sided with the aircraft's pilot. The judge has dismissed a proposed $10,000 fine against businessman Raphael Pirker, who used a remotely operated 56-inch foam glider to take aerial video for an advertisement for the University of Virginia Medical Center. The FAA alleged that since Pirker was using the aircraft for profit, he ran afoul of regulations requiring commercial operators of \"Unmanned Aircraft Systems\" -- sometimes called UAS or drones -- to obtain FAA authorization. But a judge on Thursday agreed with Pirker that the FAA overreached by applying regulations for aircraft to model aircraft, and said no FAA rule prohibited Pirker's radio-controlled flight. Thursday's ruling is believed to be the first to address the issue, but it was not immediately clear whether the FAA would appeal, or what impact it would have on others hoping to use drones for profit. As recently as last week, the FAA had publicized its restrictions on commercial use of drones. In a press release headlined \"Busting Myths about the FAA and Unmanned Aircraft,\" it stressed that UAS enthusiasts could not use drones for commercial purposes. \"A commercial flight requires a certified aircraft, a licensed pilot and operating approval. To date, only one operation has met these criteria, using Insitu's ScanEagle, and authorization was limited to the Arctic,\" the FAA's Busting Myths release said. \"There are no shades of gray in FAA regulations,\" the FAA continued. \"Anyone who wants to fly an aircraft-manned or unmanned-in U.S. airspace needs some level of FAA approval.\" The FAA could not be reached Thursday night for comment on the Pirker ruling. Pirker's attorney, Brendan Schulman, called it \"a tremendously significant decision for model aircraft and commercial drone operators.\" \"As a general matter, the decision finds that the FAA's 2007 policy statement banning the commercial use of...",

And as Election Day has drawn closer, those differences have become more pronounced. Republican opponents are trying harder than ever to link their rivals to the president, forcing Democrats to visibly distinguish themselves from the White House. Here are seven Democratic candidates who've kept Obama on the sidelines: . 1. Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky. As the Democrat challenging the Senate's top Republican in a state that voted for Mitt Romney two years ago, Grimes has been perhaps the most high-profile candidate to keep her distance from Obama. Most notably, she refuses to say whether she voted for the president, citing a matter of principle of privacy at the ballot box as her reason for not answering the question. She's been pressed about her support for the president because she's made a blatant attempt to paint herself as the Democratic antithesis to the commander in chief. \"I'm not Barack Obama,\" she said in a campaign ad. \"I disagree with him on guns, coal and the EPA.\" 2. Sen. Mark Begich, Alaska. Only 41% of Alaska voters sided with Obama in 2012, so Begich knows all too well that it's not a smart strategy to be a champion for the president. In fact, he likes to think of himself more as a \"thorn.\" \"I'll be a thorn in his [posterior],\" Begich told the Washington Post. \"There's times when I'm a total thorn, you know, and he doesn't appreciate it.\" Last week he admitted he voted for Obama but argued that his voting record was irrelevant because \"the president's not relevant\" and will be \"gone in two years.\" A limited role for Obama in his final campaign .

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- The flight data and cockpit voice recorders from JetBlue Flight 191, which made an emergency landing this week, have been retrieved and will be analyzed, officials said Thursday. The National Transportation Safety Board will download the data Friday, said spokeswoman Kelly Nantel. Information gleaned from them will be given to the FBI, she said. Investigators are looking into the apparent midair meltdown of the captain, Clayton Osbon, whose remarks and erratic behavior Tuesday led the co-pilot to lock him out of the cockpit. Crew and passengers subdued Osbon as he screamed and banged on the door so hard the first officer thought Osbon would come through, according to a federal criminal complaint filed Wednesday against Osbon. The complaint says Osbon began making remarks during the flight that concerned the first officer, who is his co-pilot. \"Osbon yelled over the radio to air traffic control and instructed them to be quiet. Osbon turned off the radios in the aircraft, dimmed his monitors and sternly admonished the FO (first officer) for trying to talk on the radio,\" the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of Texas said in a written statement. \"When Osbon said 'we need to take a leap of faith,' the FO stated that he became very worried. Osbon told the FO that 'we're not going to Vegas,' and began giving what the FO described as a sermon.\" It was not immediately known whether the alleged remarks are audible on the voice recorder. But federal regulations state that planes manufactured since 1991 must record cockpit chatter on microphones. The JetBlue plane was new and would be subject to the rule. The cockpit voice recorder captures two hours of data and the flight data recorder, which measures the plane's speed and altitude, contains 25 hours. About 3\u00c2\u00bd hours into the planned five-hour flight from New York's Kennedy International Airport to Las Vegas, the pilot left the cockpit to use the lavatory, but he failed to follow security protocol, alarming the crew, according to an affidavit...",

            "Koro, Uganda (CNN) -- One of the abducted boys featured in the viral video demanding the capture of infamous warlord Joseph Kony is now a man and says the time for justice has arrived. Jacob Acaye, now 21, revisited the village where he was abducted by Kony's Lord's Resistance Army to tell why Kony's crimes should not be forgotten. His story has touched millions since it was featured in \"Kony 2012,\" a video from the Invisible Children charity that created a global online buzz and renewed public interest in capturing Kony. Critics have questioned the film's accuracy and warned that it oversimplified the situation in Uganda. Kony first unleashed his fury in eastern Africa more than two decades ago and is wanted for crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. The LRA terrorized Uganda in a brutal campaign against the government and civilian population. Since 2006, when it was pushed out of northern Uganda, it has largely operated in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic. Invisible Children aimed to make Kony a household name and drum up global support to end the murders, rapes, abductions and other abuses committed by the LRA. Acaye -- sitting a few meters from where he was abducted -- told CNN: \"Whenever a brother is in a problem, whenever anybody is in a problem, it should get the attention of everyone in the world. \"It has been going on for the last 26 years. It shows that we are failing to solve it.

Darryl Littlejohn, 44, is already serving prison time for the attempted kidnapping of another student in 2005. Darryl Littlejohn, 44, was convicted of first-degree murder last month in the 2006 death of Imette St. Guillen, 24, who had been studying criminology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. Littlejohn, who is already serving 25 years to life for the October 2005 attempted kidnapping of a 19-year-old Queens college student, will serve out the sentences consecutively, said Sarah McNaughton of the Brooklyn district attorney's office. During the trial, witnesses said they saw Littlejohn and St. Guillen leaving The Falls bar in lower Manhattan together early February 25, 2006. Littlejohn was working as a bouncer at the bar. Hours later, St. Guillen's nude body was found in an isolated lot in Brooklyn. Her face was covered with strips of packing tape, and a sock was stuffed into her throat. She died of asphyxiation, and investigators determined she had been raped. Littlejohn was charged with murder after investigators linked his DNA to blood found on plastic ties used to bind St. Guillen's hands behind her back. Littlejohn's attorney, Joyce David, has filed an appeal on behalf of her client and maintains his innocence. She said that although Littlejohn has a long criminal record, he has no history of violence against women. The horrific incident spread shockwaves through New York City nightlife, which relies heavily on unlicensed bouncers to keep order in the city's bars and nightclubs. Littlejohn is being held at New York's Rikers Island maximum security facility. CNN's Chris Kokenes and Kristen Hamill contributed to this report .",

And what I've seen is surprisingly encouraging. The future isn't hard to excavate in Greece. Indeed, immediately upon arrival at Athens airport, travelers are confronted by spread of slick advertisements for a global bank. \"The future is full of opportunity. Be part of the future,\" one of these advertisements advises. \"Age will be no barrier to ambition,\" another promises. \"Even the smallest business will be multinational,\" a third guarantees. But today, in a Greece wracked by the most serious economic crisis for at least a century, the truth about the country's economic future is mostly the opposite of these advertisements. In Greece today, the future is mostly characterized by fear rather than opportunity. The problem is that this small country doesn't appear to be part of anyone's \"future.\" Increasingly peripheral, even to the euro crisis, Greece is in danger of drifting back into its dark 20th century past: back to the self-destructive politics of anti-capitalist violence and ethnic hatred; back perhaps to the drachma, to economic autarky and perhaps even to a financial apocalypse equivalent to the Great Depression.

Lawyers for the two sides are continuing talks on some final sticking points in the settlement covering the bank's mortgage securities practices. The outline of the deal was struck last Friday. The biggest point of contention remaining is whether some of the settlement money covering mortgage securities sold by Washington Mutual, which was acquired by JPMorgan, could end up coming from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the government-backed insurer of banking deposits, the source says. When JPMorgan bought failing Washington Mutual from the government in 2008, the FDIC was stuck with some of its liabilities. The Justice Department insists on language in the settlement that would prohibit JPMorgan from making claims against the FDIC for some of the money it is going to have to pay. On Friday, JPMorgan and the agency that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac concluded their portion of the broader settlement. The bank agreed to pay $5.1 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to cover alleged deceptive practices in sales of mortgage securities, including by Washington Mutual, to the government-backed housing finance giants. The FHFA agreement doesn't include a prohibition on JPMorgan recovering money from the FDIC. Justice Department lawyers want it included in their final deal. JPMorgan declined comment.",

Rapid HIV test swabs incubate at the Iris House in New York in 2007. The agency estimates that 72 of every 100,000 New Yorkers -- a total of 4,800 individuals -- contracted HIV in 2006, more than triple the national rate of 23 per 100,000. The findings are based on new lab technology and a newly derived statistical model developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The lab technology enables health officials to determine whether HIV-positive individuals contracted the virus within the past five months, and the statistical model allows researchers to then make projections about a population's infection rate. HIV, or the human immunodeficiency virus, is the virus that causes AIDS. The Health Department points to the city's demographics. \"The populations that bear the greatest burden nationally -- blacks, for example, and men who have sex with men -- are highly represented in New York City,\" Health Commissioner Thomas Freidan said in a written statement. \"Because HIV is more prevalent within those groups, the risk of HIV infection per sexual contact is higher.\" In June, the city launched a three-year initiative to administer HIV tests to the 250,000 Bronx adults who have never been tested. The program was announced just days after release of a study finding a high rate of \"unsafe sexual behavior\" in the city. Freidan said the study showed that 36 percent of gay and bisexual New York men who had five or more partners in the previous year did not use condoms consistently. \"This is a core group which is at high risk for getting and spreading HIV,\" Freidan said. In July, a study of 452 men interviewed anonymously at gay bars and clubs found 39 percent of those having sex with other men had not revealed their sexual orientation to their doctors, significantly diminishing their likelihood of being tested for HIV.",

Officials have said Jeff Bush's body won't be recovered. It remains buried somewhere in the sinkhole that stretches 20 feet wide and more than 50 feet deep. Authorities made the heartbreaking decision to stop the search for Bush, 36, after his odds of survival became abundantly clear. \"We just have not been able to locate Mr. Bush, and so for that reason, the rescue effort is being discontinued,\" Hillsborough County Administrator Mike Merrill told reporters Saturday. \"At this point, it's really not possible to recover the body.\" Sinkholes: Common, costly and sometimes deadly . A deafening noise . The family's nightmare began Thursday night, just as everyone was about to go to sleep. A deafening noise shattered the peace in the house in the Tampa suburb of Seffner. Jeremy Bush heard his brother scream and ran toward Jeff's bedroom. \"Everything was gone. My brother's bed, my brother's dresser, my brother's TV. My brother was gone,\" he told CNN's \"AC360.\" Jeremy Bush jumped into the hole and frantically shoveled away rubble. But as the house's floor further collapsed, a sheriff's deputy pulled him to safety and his brother remained trapped below....",

But when he goes to answer his door, the black actor knows what it's like to be an outcast. Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested last week on a charge of disorderly conduct. \"When I'm opening the door of my own house, someone will ask me where the man of the house is, implying that I'm staff,\" said Kodjoe, best known for starring in Showtime's \"Soul Food.\" It's a feeling some African-Americans say is all too common, even to this day in America: No matter your status or prominence in society, you're still typecast. That's why the recent arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr., one of the nation's most prominent African-American scholars, has stirred outrage and debate.

We are all suspects.\" In an interview with The Root, Gates said he was outraged by the incident and hopes to use the experience as a teaching tool, including a possible PBS special on racial profiling. \"I can't believe that an individual policeman on the Cambridge police force would treat any African-American male this way, and I am astonished that this happened to me; and more importantly I'm astonished that it could happen to any citizen of the United States, no matter what their race,\" Gates said. \"And I'm deeply resolved to...",

            "(CNN)  -- It was one of the most surreal images in American history: A river, so fouled with industrial waste that it caught fire and burned. In June 1969, Cleveland's Cuyahoga River become the poster child for the birth of the modern American environmental movement. Concerns over air and water pollution helped spawn the modern environmental movement in the 1960s. No matter that this was at least the tenth time the Cuyahoga had ignited. The times, they were a-changing, and a burning river confirmed what many already believed: The environment was changing, too. Rachel Carson's book, \"Silent Spring,\" published seven years earlier, had lit the spark. The mild-mannered government scientist documented how the pesticide DDT was jeopardizing countless bird species, from tiny hummingbirds to the national symbol, the bald eagle. Smog from traffic and factories had become a national concern. And six months before the torching of the Cuyahoga, a massive oil spill soiled the shores of Santa Barbara, California. In the midst of the anti-Vietnam war movement, the women's movement, and more, a divided America also found room for an environmental movement. \"We have been acting out the classic cartoon image of a man sitting on the branch of a tree and sawing it off behind him,\" wrote Philip Shabecoff in his 1993 book, \"A Fierce Green Fire: The American Environmental Movement.\" Shabecoff described environmentalism as a \"broad social movement\" that was attempting to build a \"desperately needed but difficult and obstacle-strewn road\" out of humankind's increasingly polluted predicament. The movement was sanctioned in April 1970 with a nationwide quasi-holiday, the first \"Earth Day.\" New organizations formed to rally the masses: Friends of the Earth (1969), the Natural Resources Defense Council (1970), and Canadian-born Greenpeace (1971). Books touting recycling, vegetarianism, and all aspects of a \"green\" lifestyle hit the best-seller list. An ersatz Indian who called himself Iron Eyes Cody became a national icon thanks to a..."

Rubble litters Beichuan, China, nearly a year after an earthquake killed thousands. The 52-page report, released Sunday and titled \"Justice Denied: Harassment of Sichuan Earthquake Survivors and Activists,\" documented instances where parents and relatives said they had been detained for up to 21 days for trying to get answers from officials about their children's deaths. Some said they had been detained several times. \"By unlawfully locking up parents of children who died, the government is creating more misery for people who have said in some cases they lost everything in the Sichuan earthquake,\" said Roseann Rife, deputy program director of Amnesty International Asia-Pacific. \"The government of China must cease harassing earthquake survivors who are seeking answers and trying to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives.\" CNN was not immediately able to get a response to the report from the Chinese government's Ministry of Civil Affairs and Ministry of Justice. The report accused authorities of having prevented parents and relatives from complaining to higher officials about the quality of construction in the buildings that collapsed, referred to by critics as \"Tofu Dregs Construction.\" It further alleged that many parents complained that their phones had been tapped and that they were arbitrarily detained so they would not be able to seek justice in the courts. The human-rights organization called on Chinese authorities \"to take immediate action to address the grievances of survivors and relatives of those who were killed or injured\" during the 8.0 magnitude earthquake, which struck at 2:28 p.m. May 12, 2008, when many children were in school.

Millions of Americans use it to help smooth their wrinkles. As more people use Botox as the ultimate wrinkle remover, doctors are realizing that its benefits go far deeper than the skin. Now it's being used to help stroke victims. A study showing these benefits was released in October 2005. What is Botox? Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent: Botox is a brand name for botulinum toxin type A. It's produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. In its purest form, botulinum is one of the deadliest poisons known to humans. It can cause death by paralysis. What does Botox do? Gupta: In 1989, long before physicians injected Botox into faces to smooth wrinkles, the FDA approved it for patients with debilitating neurological diseases such as dystonia. In these conditions, faulty connections between brain and muscle cause parts of the body to spasm. Muscles are locked into uncomfortable, often excruciating, positions. Amazingly, Botox liberated many of these patients by actually chemically allowing their muscles to relax. On a basic level, that is what's happening with Botox for wrinkles -- the muscle is loosening its grip on facial skin. This ability to stop the brain from triggering the muscle malfunction led researchers to use Botox for a whole host of other conditions. Up to four in 10 stroke survivors suffer from spastic disability. You may recognize it as stiffness on one side of the body, often seen in a club-like hand or foot. These people lose their independence -- the ability to wash themselves, to eat, even walk. Botox has been used for years in these stroke patients in combination with physical therapy. It allows some of them to gain back mobility and function in their muscles. Is Botox the perfect solution? Gupta: Botox isn't a cure-all. It can have minor side effects and more studies need to be done on long-term use. But for many patients, Botox provides...",

A car bombing in Homs' al-Zahra neighborhood killed 40, SANA reported, citing an unnamed source in the area. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, also reported many casualties, including women and children, in the car bomb attack. It described al-Zahra as an Alawite neighborhood. Syria's President Bashar al-Assad is a member of the Alawite religious sect, which is an offshoot of Shia Islam. In Damascus, mortar rounds hit the al-Shaghour neighborhood. Two slammed into the Badr-Eddin al-Hooni Institute for Islamic Sharia Sciences, killing 14. Four people were killed in a mortar strike at a center for displaced people in the Damascus countryside. Three of those killed were children. Scores of people were wounded in the violence. The unrest comes amid Syria's three-year civil war pitting government forces against rebels trying to end the rule of al-Assad. The government often refers to rebels as armed terrorists bent on destabilizing the country. The government announced this month that new elections would be held June 3. But that may not yield any change in a country where al-Assad's family has had a tight grip on power for 43 years. Al-Assad succeeded his father in 2000 and won a second term in 2007, unopposed. More than 100,000 people, including many civilians, have been killed in the war. Chlorine gas attack claims .

Chavez's death has captured the world's attention front and center with renewed vigor and interest. He first burst onto the world scene with his presidential victory in 1999. Since then, through his fourth re-election in January -- and while he was in Cuba fighting the cancer that would take his life -- his focus was on forging a new socialist Venezuela. This won many friends and advocates at home and abroad, especially among Venezuela's and the hemisphere's poorest populations. Other world powers demonized Chavez and sought to ostracize him, a la Cuba's Fidel Castro, on a global scale. But I believe peaceful, constructive negotiation should carry the day over isolation and demonization. That's why I visited Venezuela in 2005, just after the Rev. Pat Robertson called for the assassination of Chavez. He inflamed a chorus of extremist voices in seeking a way to \"deal with Chavez.\" That type of hot rhetoric serves no productive purpose. I went to talk with Chavez; I talked with Jewish religious leaders in Venezuela. I talked with Afro-Venezuelans. I learned about the transition taking place from the old banana republic regimes to the new leaders, with new ideas, such as Chavez in Venezuela, Luiz Lula da Silva in Brazil and Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia. I looked not to exploit differences and fuel division, but for common ground. That's why I went to Iraq to talk with Saddam Hussein in 1990 as he invaded Kuwait and convinced him there was no value in holding hundreds of people from the United States and other countries as \"human shields.\" He released them. That's why I went to what remained of Yugoslavia amid the flames of war in 1999, to talk with Slobodan Milosevic to persuade him to release the three U.S. soldiers being held hostage. He did. And that's why I went to Cuba in 1984 -- long under a senseless U.S. blockade -- to talk...",

There was simply no stopping the four-time world champion, who will be bidding for a record eighth straight Grand Prix victory and his 12th of the season when the race proper gets underway in Austin Sunday afternoon. Vettel looked to be second best to Webber until pulling out all the stops for a one minute 36.338 second clocking, just 0.103 seconds better than the Australian on his final run. It was Red Bull's fifth one-two on the grid this season and Vettel's 44th career pole. It served as the perfect 40th birthday present for team chief Christian Horner. \"Happy birthday to Christian,\" said Vettel. \"It's a good result to have both cars on the front row. It was a tricky session as the wind picked up quite a lot from this morning. It's not that easy round the high-speed corners. \"It was a good battle with Mark, he has got closer and closer as the weekend has gone on,\" he told the official F1 website. Webber was disappointed to miss out first place on the grid, looking to end his F1 career with a victory in one of the final two rounds. \"Today I let pole slip through my fingers. Well done to Seb. He put three sectors together and I put two-and-a-half together. It's not satisfying when you do that,\" he said.

            "It's official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria. Obama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons. The proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force \"to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction.\" It's a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle. There are key questions looming over the debate: What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria? What happens if Congress votes no? And how will the Syrian government react? In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to -- but because he wants to. \"While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective,\" he said. \"We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual.\" Obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9.

        "Sum the following article in brief: Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Nearly 60 Bahraini activists turned out Wednesday in downtown Manama calling for the release of hunger striker Abdulhadi al-Khawaja. His daughter, Zainab al-Khawaja, stood at the front of the crowd and accused the government of torture. Police pushed protesters out of the marketplace, known as the Souk, and used stun grenades in an attempt to clear the crowd. Reporters were kept behind the police line during the protest and were told that the protest was illegal. Al-Khawaja, 52, was arrested in April 2011 for his role in anti-government protests that began a month earlier with demands for political reform and greater freedoms in the Sunni-ruled, Shiite-majority nation. In June, Bahrain found him and seven other Shiite opposition activists guilty of plotting to overthrow the country's royal family. The government has said he can appeal his life sentence during a hearing April 23. Last week the human rights group Amnesty International asked for al-Khawaja's release, saying in a statement that Bahrain's \"determination to persecute him seems to override any consideration for justice or humanity.\" Zainab al-Khawaja said last week that her father was having trouble breathing and was harassed by hospital staff and security guards. \"His tone and the way he was speaking was like he was saying goodbye,\" she said on April 10. \"We're not sure if we'll ever see him again.\" The United Nations last week urged Bahrain to consider transferring the detainee, who holds Danish citizenship, to Denmark on humanitarian grounds, but a judicial panel has said al-Khawaja does not meet the conditions to be transferred into Danish custody, according to the Bahrain News Agency. On Wednesday, al-Khawaja's hunger strike entered its 70th day.",

The two casualties, Lt. Travis Manion and Lt. Brendan Looney, met a decade ago while attending the United States Naval Academy. They became close friends and lived together from sophomore year until their graduation in 2004, Travis' sister, Ryan Manion-Borek, told CNN. Their friendship was cut short in April 2007, when Manion was killed in Iraq during an ambush on the final patrol of his second tour of duty, according to the Department of Defense. He was 27. According to the Defense Department's website, Manion's actions \"ultimately saved the lives of every member of his patrol,\" and he was posthumously awarded the Silver Star and the Bronze Star with Valor. The Iraqis named their new headquarters \"Combat Outpost Manion.\" Though Manion-Borek told CNN that her brother had \"hoped to be buried in Arlington if anything happened to him,\" his family -- grief-stricken by the sudden loss -- chose to lay him to rest at a cemetery near his Pennsylvania home. When Looney heard the news of his friend's death, he was in Navy SEAL training and unable to leave. The situation almost drove him to quit the program. However, Manion-Borek said that after a phone call with Manion's mother Looney chose to stay, telling her he was, \"finishing this for Travis.\" Looney went on to finish first in his SEAL class, a position known as \"Honor Man.\" Following Manion's death, his family founded the Travis Manion Foundation, which helps soldiers who are returning home after deployments and veterans. In the foundation's first appearance at the Marine Corps Marathon as \"Team Travis,\" Looney was a teary-eyed guest speaker. Even through training and deployment, Looney continued to stay close to the Manion family and the foundation. But last week the Looney family got word that Brendan...",

That's how friends described Chad Wayne Oulson, who was fatally shot in a dispute about texting in a Florida cinema Monday. \"It is just going to be a huge hole in everybody's lives for him and his family. He'd give you the shirt off his back if he needed to,\" Joseph Trapani told CNN affiliate WFTS. Oulson, 43, was with his wife at the Grove 16 theater in the Tampa suburb of Wesley Chapel, where they were about to watch the Peter Berg film \"Lone Survivor.\" They were on a lunch and movie date, WFTS reported. Her friends said that Oulson's wife had taken off from work to spend the day with her husband during time off from his job. She works for USAA selling insurance, while Oulson did financial work for SKY Powersports in Port Richey, the affiliate said. At the movies, a confrontation arose between Oulson and a 71-year-old retired police officer when Oulson sent a text message during previews to his young daughter, police said. The former officer, Curtis Reeves, told Oulson to put away his cell phone, and a subsequent dispute ended when Reeves allegedly shot Oulson. Oulson's wife was shot in her hand when she raised it as the bullet was fired, police said. The single bullet then went into Oulson's chest. \"She's a wreck. I mean she just lost her husband, the father of her little girl over something that should have never happened,\" WFTS reported Trapani said. Reeves, a former Tampa Police Department officer, has been charged with second-degree murder. He was denied bond during his first court appearance Tuesday. According to an obituary on the website of Loyless Funeral Home in Land O'Lakes, Florida, a memorial service for Oulson is scheduled for Saturday. He was born in Alton, Illinois, and spent the last 20 years in Florida, according to the obituary.

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- A few years ago, Brian Daniel was driving around Los Angeles when he spotted a neon sign for a random storage facility. The red stick figures carrying yellow boxes glowed from the mundane building. It was like it was screaming out to him. Daniel loved how a sign could go from ordinary and unremarkable during the day to \"talking to you\" at night. L.A.'s neon won over the frequent traveler, who has concluded the City of Angels has the best neon anywhere. \"They have just enough peppered through the city where it just comes alive,\" said Daniel, a Chicago-based headhunter. \"I was so compelled by it that for two weeks I just drove around and took pictures of neon signs.\" What's disappointing for enthusiasts like Daniel is that neon is dying. Businesses are switching to cheaper, more energy-efficient LED bulbs and municipal planning boards are zoning out neon to decrease the number of unsightly displays. \"Neon spent most of its career in this country more hated than loved in terms of being banned and put under zoning ordinances,\" said neon historian Thomas Rinaldi. \"It's an iconic part of the 20th century, but it's been legislated out of existence in some places. There's a vindictive attitude toward it.\" Neon lights weren't always losing ground. They were once in LED's shoes, beating out an old mode of lighting. In 1902, just a few years after neon gas was discovered by British chemists, French engineer Georges Claude sent it coursing through electrified glass tubes, creating neon lighting. The new type of light quickly ousted incandescent bulbs, the former favorite of sign-makers. Claude started marketing neon signs in Europe and in the early 1920s came to America, where neon's popularity exploded, said Rinaldi. In the 1930s, neon was everywhere in America. In the beginning of the decade, shops saw the glowing lights as a novelty, though an expensive one, to keep them competitive. They were installed for big corporate chain retailers like car dealers. But by the end of the decade, big businesses had found...",

The first one helped get her elected mayor. The second has added fuel to the fire of scandal consuming the administration of Gov. Chris Christie, a possible presidential candidate. The stakes are high and Zimmer's right in the middle of it with her allegations the administration conditioned Superstorm Sandy relief money for her town to her support for a redevelopment project proposed by a company with ties to Christie. Zimmer was a little-known Hoboken City Council president when she stepped in as its first female mayor in 2009 after Peter Cammarano was arrested in a pay-to-play scheme. He was convicted on federal charges and jailed. She made her mark in local politics working to stop a high-rise redevelopment plan, a controversy that played out in court. A Democrat, the wife of a diamond manufacturing executive, and the mother of two children, Zimmer was reelected in November. Republicans paint her as one of many partisan opportunists seeking to derail Christie, who appeals to both GOP and Democratic voters in traditionally \"blue\" New Jersey. Her allegations have added a new dimension to allegations of hardball politics gone awry in New Jersey under the leadership of Christie, hailed by many in his own party, and some Democrats, as a straight-shooter and a refreshing change from scripted politics. \"It's stunning. It's outrageous. But it's true,\" Zimmer told CNN's Candy Crowley on \"State of the Union\" Sunday of her claims that Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno told her in a parking lot in May that Sandy funds were conditioned on her support for the redevelopment project. Guadango said her dispatch is \"a direct message from the governor,\" Zimmer said. The allegations, denied by Guandango, are the first time an official has connected Christie directly to recent controversies plaguing his administration.

The Internet giant on Tuesday embellished its search page with an animated, interactive doodle that lets users run the hurdles by tapping on their keyboards. Tapping the arrow keys makes the hurdler run, while hitting the space bar helps him leap over the 10 hurdles in his path. Each effort is timed, and runners can earn up to three virtual stars -- think of them as gold, silver or bronze medals. (Note from, ahem, personal experience: If you fail to clear a single hurdle, you win nothing and your runner hangs his head dejectedly at the finish line.) Bored office drones, say goodbye to your workplace productivity. Google's online hurdle race coincides, of course, with track and field events this week at the London Olympics. The brief animation is the latest in an occasional series of interactive Google doodles commemorating special events. Past doodles have let users observe a lunar eclipse, play notes on a virtual synthesizer to observe the 78th birthday of Robert Moog and elude ghosts in a playable online version of Pac-Man, the classic arcade game.

Recent comments by officials in both Kuala Lumpur and Beijing have emphasized the active cooperation between the two countries, while also downplaying accusations lodged by Chinese families against the Malaysian government. According to Hong Kong's South China Morning Post, China's Ambassador to Malaysia sought to distance these \"radical views\" from his country's official position. They \"do not represent the views of Chinese people and the Chinese government,\" he was quoted as saying. Some of the Chinese relatives of passengers aboard the missing Boeing 777 have been openly critical of the investigation. They went so far as to release a statement calling the Malaysian government and its military the \"real murderers\" of their loved ones. In a press conference Saturday, Acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein made it clear China will be an accredited member of the investigation team. A few days earlier, he spoke about Malaysia's duty to keep its Asian neighbor informed about all progress. James Chin, professor of political science at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, said the rift always appeared larger in the media than at an official level. \"I think among the diplomats they do understand this is just a small thing within the larger context of Malaysia-China relations and this will not alter relationships in the long term.\" Trade partners .

            "(EW.com) -- On the topic of TV shows getting a second life, it's impossible not to look to Sex and the City, the original model for Community fans' cheer of \"six seasons and a movie.\" After six fashionable years of Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte's adventures on TV, the iconic HBO comedy series found new life \u2014 twice \u2014 with two big-screen adaptations, both written and directed by series exec producer Michael Patrick King. During our chat with King about the revival chances of his other HBO show, The Comeback, the conversation of course veered into Sex territory. (How could it not?) The big question: could a third Sex and the City movie ever get off the ground? Back in January, Sarah Jessica Parker told InStyle that she believed there was one last chapter to tell. Well, King agrees. \"The great gift or riches or luck is that I worked on two shows that were so full that they spilled over into people's lives and the characters were rounded enough that you could still wonder where they are,\" King says, adding that Sex and the City is still thriving on TV, especially as alternative programming (HBO marathoned the series on Super Bowl Sunday). EW: Should there be a 'Sex and the City 3' movie? Acknowledging Parker's comments on a third film, King explains, \"Sarah Jessica and I both know what that final chapter is. That doesn't mean it will or should be told, but I do think there's one story left. Whether it ever happens is a whole other situation. But there's four girls, and those girls are still in my mind. There are other stories to tell and characters that haven't even been written yet.\" The show went off the air exactly 10 years ago, in February 2004, delivering series-high ratings for the emotional finale. Four years later, Sex and the City hit movie theaters and raked in $152 million at the domestic box office, with critical reviews split right down the middle. Sex and the City 2 opened with significantly less ballyhoo in 2010 and made $95 million at home, with the Rotten Tomatoes score at just 15%. If..."

How else can we explain the endless parade of otherwise successful individuals, who by all appearances seem intelligent and competent, and yet risk destroying their careers and their personal lives over the chance to have a sexual escapade? John Edwards crashing from the heights of promise to infamy, from presidential candidate to defendant in a trial after a secret affair; Secret Service agents ending their careers in disgrace over dalliances with prostitutes in Colombia, all join that long procession of men who managed to self-destruct, pulling a pin on the grenade of their careers and perhaps their personal lives for the sake of a little fun. The pageant of legacy-killing misjudgment includes a president, several might-have-been presidents, a few governors, a World Bank director, a former Dutch prime minister, an Israeli president and one of the top golfers of all time. And that is only a partial list. How to explain it? The question has baffled women, mostly, since biblical times. Perhaps the Secret Service agents thought their behavior, if discovered, would raise no eyebrows. But the stupidity was in evidence when one of the agents, who had earlier \"protected\" Sarah Palin, posted on Facebook that he was \"checking her out.\" Sounds like the claim of a 13-year-old boy. And the decision to post the comment displays the common sense of an 8-year-old. But that level of maturity and judgment shines compared to the decision of, say President Bill Clinton, who risked his presidency to have an affair with Monica Lewinsky, and then lied about it repeatedly. A brilliant man, everyone said about the president, but also one of only two presidents in American history impeached. The Clinton experience almost numbed us to the epidemic scale of the problem.

Les Bleus avenged their 2007 semi defeat by the English on home soil with a 19-12 victory in Auckland, setting up a last-four clash with Wales -- who went through after beating Celtic neighbors Ireland 22-10. With the other half of the drawing pitting hosts New Zealand against Argentina, and world champions South Africa versus Australia -- both games are on Sunday -- there could potentially be a repeat of the inaugural 1987 final when the All Blacks beat France. Coach Lievremont will be replaced by Philippe Saint-Andre after the tournament, but he has the chance to help France to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for the first time. His team lost to New Zealand and Tonga in the group stage, but roared to a 16-0 halftime lead at Eden Park as wing Vincent Clerc and fullback Maxime Medard crossed for tries, while Dimitri Yachvili kicked two penalties. England, the 2003 champions, rallied with second-half tries to fullback Ben Foden and wing Mark Cueto but a drop-goal by Francois Trinh-Duc in between those scores kept France safely ahead. \"You can't give a good team like France 16 points of a start.

A prefabricated court complex has been erected at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to try terrorism suspects. The decision marks another legal blow to the Bush administration's war on terrorism policies. The 5-4 vote reflects the divide over how much legal autonomy the U.S. military should have to prosecute about 270 prisoners, some of whom have been held for more than six years without charges. Fourteen of them are alleged to be top al Qaeda figures. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said, \"the laws and Constitution are designed to survive, and remain in force, in extraordinary times. Liberty and security can be reconciled; and in our system reconciled within the framework of the law.\" Kennedy, the court's swing vote, was supported by Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, generally considered the liberal contingent. At issue was the rights of detainees to contest their imprisonment and challenge the rules set up to try them.  Watch how the 5-4 ruling is a major blow for the Bush administration \u00bb . A congressional law passed in 2006 would limit court jurisdiction to hear so-called habeas corpus challenges to detention. It is a legal question the justices have tackled three times since 2004, including Thursday's ruling. Each time, the justices have ruled against the government's claim that it has the authority to hold people it considers \"enemy combatants.\" Preliminary hearings have begun in Guantanamo for some of the accused. A military panel this month arraigned five suspected senior al Qaeda detainees, including the alleged mastermind of the September 11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was transferred to the prison camp in 2006.

The 32-year-old Swiss officially retired for the second time back in 2007, but has entered the doubles at the Southern California Open in Carlsbad, partnering Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia. Hingis, who was inducted into the International Tennis Hall Of Fame in Newport last weekend, is looking forward to returning to the fray at the tournament, which begins on July 27. \"I feel in good shape at the moment after playing World Team Tennis,\" she told the official WTA website. \"My competitive spirit is still very much alive and I love being out on court.\" Hingis, who also won nine grand slam doubles titles in a glittering career, teamed up with Hantuchova in the final three events she played in her first comeback. \"We are honored to have such a great champion choose to make the Southern California Open her first tournament back on tour,\" said tournament director Alastair Garland. Hingis cut short that comeback when it was revealed she had tested positive for a metabolite of cocaine after her third round loss at Wimbledon six years ago. She maintained her innocence, but was banned for two years by the International Tennis Federation. Hingis first burst on to the scene in 1996 by pairing with Helena Sukova to win a grand slam doubles title while only 15 years of age. The following year she became the youngest ever grand slam singles winner at 16 years three months in the Australian Open before becoming the youngest World No.1 in history. Injuries forced her first retirement in 2002 before she returned four years later, but without recapturing her former dominance. There is no indication if Hingis will extend her second comeback to singles competition, but has been successful with Washington Kastles in team tennis. If she does decide to go down that route, Hingis will find that one of her former arch rivals Serena Williams is still in formidable form. The World No.1...",

The ruling by watchdogs will embarrass the lobby group, which has been found guilty of failing to live up to the high standards of fairness and accuracy it demands of the Press. The group hoped the power of celebrity would help it to victory in its cause and crafted an advert designed to win support. It featured the names of more than 200 public figures it said backed its campaign, which appeared under the headline: \u2018The Leveson Royal Charter Declaration\u2019. The language and presentation implied the proposals had been endorsed by the judge who led the inquiry into Press standards. In fact, there was no such endorsement from Lord Justice Leveson in the advert, which ran in the Guardian and some other publications. In a ruling today, the Advertising Standards Authority said the language used by Hacked Off was \u2018confusing\u2019, \u2018ambiguous\u2019 and \u2018misleading\u2019. The decision may disappoint the many famous names recruited to support the declaration, who ranged from actor Stephen Fry to former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams.

Researchers say trichomonas, an STD, is most common in men ages 25 to 39. The germ, a type of parasite, can infect the prostate and may cause inflammation that spurs the growth of prostate cancer later in life, says senior author Lorelei Mucci, Ph.D., an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. \"Our underlying hypothesis is around inflammation and, in particular, we believe that inflammation from a variety of sources is leading to prostate cancer progression,\" she says. In the study, Mucci and colleagues compared 673 prostate cancer patients to 673 men without prostate cancer, and tested their blood for signs of a past infection with trichomonas. All the men were enrolled in the Physician's Health Study, according to the report published this week in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. They found that roughly one in five men had been infected with trichomonas at some point in his life. Men infected with trichomonas were no more likely to develop prostate cancer in general. But those with a past trichomonas infection were two to three times more likely to develop an aggressive and potentially life-threatening form of prostate cancer. Trichomonas affects 174 million people around the world each year, and, at any given time, about 3 percent of younger men are infected with trichomonas; it is most common in men ages 25 to 39. However, trichomonas is an STD that's probably on more women's radars than men's because women are more likely to get symptoms such as discharge and itching.

A new film on PBS explores how the Chandler family helped develop Los Angeles through their newspaper. Los Angeles' development from an arid wasteland to a world metropolis and cultural capital is closely linked to the newspaper's rise under the ownership of one family. \"It would still be a desert,\" documentary filmmaker Peter Jones said, if Gen. Harrison Gray Otis didn't arrive in the 1880s to take over the bankrupt Los Angeles Times and his son-in-law, Harry Chandler, wasn't there to follow him. Jones' documentary is a saga of four generations of the region's most powerful family shaping Los Angeles as they pursued their own civil agendas -- and accumulated wealth. \"Inventing L.A.: The Chandlers and Their Times\" premieres Monday on PBS. Historian David Halberstam said in the documentary that the Chandlers dominated Southern California as no other family has dominated any major region of the United States. \"They did not so much foster the growth of Los Angeles as invent it,\" said Halberstam, who died in 2007. Harrison Gray Otis, Harry Chandler, Norman Chandler and Otis Chandler succeeded each other at the helm of the Los Angeles Times over a span of 100 years. The city grew from a small desert town to the nation's second-largest city, while the family became one of the nation's wealthiest. The Chandler family dynasty ended when the general's great-grandson Otis Chandler was ousted as chairman of the Times board of directors in 1985. The family eventually sold its Times-Mirror Company to Chicago's Tribune Company -- which is now in bankruptcy. Each man's personality and strengths were tailored for what was demanded of their time, said Jones. \"For each era, they were up to that particular era,\" he said. \"You couldn't actually rearrange them,\" said Harry Chandler's namesake and the great-great-grandson of the...",

Last year, police arrested the former minister, Andhimuthu Raja, and more than a dozen other defendants as part of high-profile investigations into the suspected below-price sale of telecom licenses. There are 17 defendants, including Raja and three companies, in the case. The 13 other individual suspects are already out on bail. Raja's lawyer Ramesh Gupta told CNN that the court ordered his client be released on bail Tuesday . The alleged scam has rocked the country's coalition government and investor confidence in Asia's third-largest economy. Suspects are accused of participating in a scheme involving the underselling of cell phone licenses at the height of India's lucrative telecom boom. Police have also questioned several high-profile executives. The firm of business tycoon Anil Ambani is among three companies named in the charge sheet spelling out the accusations. Politicians, bureaucrats and corporate officials linked to the probe have denied any wrongdoing.

James Michael Biela, 28, was convicted last week of first-degree murder and sexual assault in the death of Brianna Denison. He also was convicted of two counts of sexual assault for attacks on two other women and of one count of kidnapping relating to one of those attacks. The jury spent three hours behind closed doors Tuesday night and resumed deliberations Wednesday morning. On Tuesday, Denison's mother, Bridgette, told them to show no mercy for the man who killed her daughter and sexually assaulted two other college coeds. Denison, a sophomore at Santa Barbara City College in California, was last seen alive on her friend's couch on January 20, 2008. Three weeks later, her body was found in a field near her friend's home. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled. A pair of panties that did not belong to Denison were found near the body, in what police said was a \"calling card\" that helped them connect Biela not only to Denison but to the other assaults. From the witness stand in Biela's capital murder trial, one of the women recounted how she was attacked on the University of Nevada-Reno campus. She said her assailant threatened her with a gun, raped her and took her panties as a souvenir. The defense challenged the identification because she earlier told a friend she could not describe her attacker to police. The second woman, a student at the university, testified she was abducted outside her apartment and driven to a dark area and raped in the attacker's vehicle. The woman testified that her assailant asked for her panties and took them with him.

Ongoing violence in Somalia has devastated the capital Mogadishu. The incident occurred Monday along a road in Kismayo, the group said. Victor Okumu, 51, a Kenyan doctor; Damien Lehalle, 27, a French logistician; and a Somali driver named Billan were the MSF workers who were killed. Another member of the team was slightly wounded, the group said in a posting on its Web site. \"The exact circumstances of this fatal incident are not yet clear,\" the posting said. Also killed was journalist Hassan Kafi Hared, 36. The remote-controlled mine erupted as he was walking to a news conference in Siyad Village in northern Kismayu, said the National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ). He was working for the government-run Somali National News Agency and a Somali Web site called gedonet.com. He is survived by a wife and three children. \"This is a targeted attack and we declare that this brutal killing on the journalist and the aid workers is an attack on the society itself,\" said NUSOJ Secretary General Omar Faruk Osman, in a news release. \"We demand that transitional government and the authorities in Kismayu to identify the culprits of this crime and bring them to justice\" he said. The medical humanitarian organization said it was evacuating remaining international members of it staff from Kismayu. Hared is the second journalist to be killed this year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The first, 38-year-old Norwegian reporter Carsten Thomassen, died Jan. 15 in a suicide bomb attack in Kabul. In a written statement, a representative of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said he condemned the killings and \"demands a thorough investigation by the authorities.\" E-mail to a friend .",

            "(CNN) -- Seventy-one years have passed since that ninth day of April, 1942, on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines, where we witnessed the defeat of a once-proud Army. It was where Gen. Edward King, commander of all U.S. armed forces on Bataan, told his men, \"We have no further means of organized resistance, we are low on ammunition, have virtually no medical supplies, and our food is all but gone. Our front lines are destroyed and both flanks severely weakened. The situation has become hopeless.\" Then he continued, \"If I do not surrender all forces to the Japanese today, Bataan will be known around the world as the greatest slaughter in history.\" Those haunting words of surrender, following the Battle of Bataan, drifted down to the fighting men and women on Bataan that sad day, which marked the worst U.S. military defeat in our nation's history. Gen. Douglas MacArthur planned to keep troops on the peninsula and Corregidor Island until the U.S. Navy could provide supplies and reinforcements. But, according to an Army history, the Navy was still in shambles after the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, and no ships were capable of bringing reinforcements. Lacking supplies, the men on Bataan fought bravely for four months against the well-fed, well-armed Japanese military. The Japanese believed in the unwritten Samurai code of conduct, known as Bushido, which held that the true warrior was willing to die for the Emperor and would never surrender. King's decision to surrender was in direct conflict with an order he received from Gen. MacArthur. But he nevertheless ordered all of his troops on Bataan to lay down their arms and surrender to the Imperial Japanese. King told his men, \"You did not surrender; I ordered you to surrender.\" Some 12,000 Americans and 58,000 Filipino soldiers were surrendered that day; records show that of the 70,000 men captured, more than 20,000 were patients in field hospitals, and the remaining forces were unable to perform effectively due to being impaired by malaria or..."

George Lucas says he was \"completely surprised\" by \"Star Wars in Concert.\" Holding fast to his vision -- and his marketing rights -- for the \"Star Wars\" empire has made it the biggest franchise in history, and made Lucas one of the most powerful people in entertainment. But while he's enthusiastic about the new touring show \"Star Wars In Concert,\" it wasn't his idea, and when I talked with him before the first Los Angeles performance this week, he kept giving the credit to others. \"Star Wars In Concert\" is built around John Williams' well-known scores from the films, performed by a symphony orchestra and choir, and accompanied by specially edited clips from all six movies, displayed on a mammoth LED screen.   Watch Lucas rave about the show \u00bb . Anthony Daniels, who has played and voiced the golden protocol droid \"C3PO\" in every film and most of the spinoffs, provides live narration -- and another reason for the \"Star Wars\" fans in the audience, especially those waving lightsabers and dressed as everything from sand people to Imperial stormtroopers, to cheer mightily, as they did the night I interviewed Lucas. iReporter praises the 'Force' of the show . George Lucas: I've seen some presentations of, you know, live orchestras with \"Star Wars\" clips, and that sort of thing. But this is so much more than that -- it's so much more emotional, because what they've done is taken the emotional content of the score ... one is obviously the Imperial March, one is obviously romantic ... and then they've cut all the pictures around that from all the movies, so that you get this really wide range of visuals going with the music, and it really is quite powerful when you see the depictions of all of the various Imperial shenanigans that were going on over the Imperial March.

The famous Alpe d'Huez route asked more of the riders this year as, for the first time, the pack made a first ascent before descending back to the valley floor and then climbing the mountain for a second time. After an attacking ride, Froome fell foul of the energy-sapping conditions inside the last five kilometers of the 172-km route. The Briton sent his Sky team-mate Richie Porte back to the support car for food -- even though it is against the rules to 'feed' inside the last 20 kilometers of a stage. Race officials handed Froome a 20-second penalty but the yellow jersey holder still stretched his lead over rival Alberto Contador to five minutes, 11 seconds. \"Richie was feeling a lot better than I was and I was running out of sugars towards the end,\" explained Froome, who is aiming to win his first Tour de France after helping Sir Bradley Wiggins to the crown last year. \"I had to ask him to go back and grab me some sugars from the car. \"I was just getting in as best I could in those last few kilometers. I'm not sure if it made any difference at that point in the race. \"It's a horrible feeling and I'm just happy to have come out with more of an advantage than I had at the start of the stage. \"This was definitely one of the harder days that we've seen in this Tour but I think that's to be expected: two times up Alpe d'Huez and this late in the race, it's definitely a hard day.\" With three stages left to go before the Tour reaches its climax on the streets of the French capital, Contador must also find an extra burst of energy. The Spaniard was unable to respond when Froome pushed on twice during the second ascent. \"I wasn't on a good day,\" said Contador. \"It was hot and very humid.

In China, the number eight is culturally associated with wealth, prosperity and good fortune and rich Chinese nationals have been queuing up for the opportunity to live in Australia under the millionaire visa program. Since the scheme was launched in November 2012, 91% of the 545 applicants for the visas have been Chinese nationals, according to figures from the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection. So far, Australia has granted 65 'significant investor' visas to mainland Chinese. The requirements for getting one of the highly prized visas are simple: all you need is a clean criminal record and $A5 million ($US4.37 million) to invest. There is no language requirement, upper age limit and applicants do not even have to set up a business in Australia. Those able to park their A$5 million investment in Australia -- complying investments include government bonds, managed funds and Australian proprietary companies - for more than four years can apply for a permanent visa. Under the scheme, visa holders can keep their operations running in China if they wish. It's hoped that the move will attract a greater range of immigrants to Australia. Deloitte partner and global immigration leader Mark Wright told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the days of Chinese investors coming to Australia simply to start a corner store or a small business were over. \"Australia is now looking to attract a larger scale of investment to feed a greater level of infrastructure development,\" Wright said. According to a report by professional services company KPMG, the patterns of Chinese investment are beginning to change, with more private Chinese investors expanding their interests in the country.

Tutu, 81, also will undergo tests at the hospital in Cape Town to determine the cause of the infection, the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation said. Details of the infection were not released. \"The archbishop spent the morning in his office today before checking into hospital. He was in good spirits and full of praise for the care he receives from an exceptional team of doctors,\" the foundation said. The nonsurgical treatment is expected to take five days, according to the foundation. The Anglican cleric was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his efforts to end and heal the wounds of apartheid, South Africa's system of institutionalized racial segregation. He served as archbishop of Cape Town -- overseeing the church throughout South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Lesotho -- from 1986 until his retirement in 1996. He retired from public life in 2011. Tutu was successfully treated in the United States for prostate cancer in 1997. \"We wish him a speedy recovery and trust that he will soon resume his noble duties in the transformative socio-economic agenda of our country,\" said South Africa's governing African National Congress.

It is a 5,000-mile transatlantic commute, but that's the anti-doping plan FIFA will implement to ensure a clean World Cup in 2014. Football's global governing body was forced to take the step after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suspended testing at a laboratory in Rio. The LADETEC laboratory had its accreditation to conduct anti-doping tests taken away by WADA in August after failing to meet the organization's International Standard for Laboratories (ISL). \"Following the recent decision by WADA to revoke the accreditation of the LADETEC laboratory in Rio de Janeiro ... FIFA has decided to use the WADA accredited laboratory in Lausanne, Switzerland,\" read a FIFA statement. \"As WADA confirmed that following due process the LADETEC laboratory would not be able to achieve re-accreditation in time for the World Cup, FIFA has no other option but to handle the analysis of samples abroad.\" The facility in Lausanne was used following the 2013 Confederations Cup, a World Cup warm-up tournament held in Brazil earlier this year, for processing data on the biological profiles of players. WADA president John Fahey accepted that flying samples across the Atlantic Ocean is not ideal, but insisted the logistical hurdles were \"not insurmountable.\" \"It's almost certain it won't happen before the World Football Cup next year,\" Fahey said at the World Conference on Doping in Sport in Johannesburg. \"Clearly that will involve using another laboratory ...

Now, here's the honest truth, the plain truth: there's no silver bullet; there's no quick fix to these problems. AZUZ: President Obama, spending part of the Labor Day weekend talking about jobs in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It's part of a White House plan to put a spotlight on the U.S. economy. During yesterday's speech, the president talked about transportation projects: rebuilding roads, building and maintaining railways, working on airport runways. He says that all of that would help create jobs and help the country's economy. Now creating jobs, definitely a big priority. The government just released the latest unemployment numbers last week. And unemployment is at 9.6 percent. That is up one-tenth of a percent from the previous month, and it's been right around that same range since May. Congress would have to approve all of the president's proposed transportation projects. And some analysts don't think there's any chance of that happening soon. A recent CNN poll shows almost 60 percent of Americans disapprove of how President Obama is handling the...",

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decried what he called \"violent demonstrations\" aimed at undermining Israel's existence. \"We hope for the peace and restfulness to return quickly, but no one should be mistaken -- we are determined to defend our borders and our sovereignty,\" Netanyahu said. The conflicts broke out on \"Nakba Day.\" Nakba -- Arabic for \"catastrophe\" -- marks the period when more than 700,000 Arabs were displaced from their homes during fighting that followed the creation of Israel in 1948.

We asked Arsenal fan site\u00a0Highbury House just what the supporters feel about a former captain and hero lining up for their bitter rivals against them, especially since he's been playing so well. If you wanted a symbol of the divide among Arsenal supporters at the moment then you will find no better example than Cesc Fabregas. There is an on-going debate, both within the Emirates and on the numerous websites devoted to the club, about Arsene Wenger and his continued tenure and Barcelona\u2019s\u00a0sale of Fabregas to Chelsea has rubbed salt into those wounds. For many of us, Cesc epitomised the great things Wenger achieved over so many years.

A large amount of jellyfish inhabiting a cooling-water intake at a major Swedish nuclear plant caused operators to manually shut down production at its largest reactor this week, according to OKG, the company that runs the plant. \"The operations management at unit O3 chose to disconnect the facility from the grid at noon on Sunday due to a large amount of jellyfish present at the cooling water intake,\" an OKG statement said. \"This decision is a preventive safety measure in order for the unit to not be automatically shut down due to too-low cooling in the condenser.\" OKG did not immediately return CNN calls seeking comment, but numerous media outlets reported that Oskarhamn Unit 3 was back up and running Wednesday. \"Furthermore we have reinforced our clearing system to deal with any future jellyfish invasions,\" the outlets quoted OKG as saying in a statement. The company noted that the cooling water was used to cool steam before it went into the reactor, and the \"water has no connection to the cooling of the reactor vessel.\" The plant, located 19 miles north of Oskarshamn on the southeast Baltic coast, is Sweden's first commercial nuclear plant, commissioned in 1972, and the third reactor went into operation in 1985. It has an output capacity of 1,450 megawatts. The plant's three reactors account for 10% of Sweden's electricity generation, OKG says.

On another dominant day for England in Birmingham they finished on 456-3, to lead by 232 after India slumped to 224 all out in their first innings. Cook took full advantage of a lackluster Indian bowling attack by batting all day for an impressive 182 not out with captain Andrew Strauss and Kevin Pietersen also notching half centuries. England are now odds on favorites to go 3-0 up in the four match series and confirm their status as number one. Resuming on 84-0, Strauss and Cook made a patient start and amassed another 100 runs before Strauss was bowled by Amit Mishra for 87. Ian Bell made a confident 34 and the ball before he was clean bowled by Praveen Kumar, Cook notched up his 19th century to a standing ovation from the Edgbaston crowd.

Officials reported trains were largely empty in the Indian financial capital of Mumbai, where protests by Hindu nationalist opposition activists often bring the city to a halt. Indian railway spokesman Anil Saxena said the eastern parts of the country were the hardest hit. \"Obstructions (by strikers) are more pronounced on the eastern side,\" Saxena said. He was referring to communist-ruled West Bengal state and neighboring Orissa and Bihar. Truckers also joined the strike, parking their rigs and shutting down traffic that would normally carry goods in and out of the busy port. Opposition parties called for the strikes after the government began implementing a roll back in fuel subsides by lifting state controls on gasoline and other fuels. Demonstrations over fuel-price rises also took place in parts of New Delhi. Opposition protesters deflated tires of state-run buses in some neighborhoods. Private schools were closed Monday in the Indian capital. Television footage showed police using bamboo canes to break up a violent protest in the northern Indian city of Lucknow. Activists were also shown blocking a train in Patna in eastern India. For the average Indian, the changes are having a real impact. Usri Das Mahapatra's kitchen budget has soared the past year.

CHP Officer William Ogilvie tells the Chronicle that it's not uncommon for calls about 'animal hazards' to work themselves out before the officers arrive because animals don't like traffic any more than humans do. NBC reports that the deer seemed entered the bridge from the south, according to CHP Officer Andrew Barclay. The deer forced three northbound traffic lanes to a halt as they scampered all the way from San Francisco toward Marin. 'They pretty much created their own traffic break,' Barclay said. 'That could be what saved the deer from getting hurt ... If it was lighter traffic the cars would have been moving faster,'he added. This isn't the first time that animals have been spotted on the Golden Gate Bridge but this is the first time it's happened during his two years as serving as a public information officer. Despite the commotion, the deer got off the bridge safe and sound and the drivers were able to put their...",

A woman yells out at one point, \"They are preventing us from accessing our churches to pray.\" Some time later, the people are stopped by security forces. Barricades are set up, only to be picked up and taken away. There's also some pushing and shoving before the scene eventually calms down. The special coordinator's office explained that the group had intended to move from the area's New Gate to the Holy Sepulchre \"at the invitation of the Palestinian Christian community in Jerusalem.\" It said the group had been earlier given \"assurances ... of unhindered access,\" only to have \"the Israeli police refuse ... to allow such entry claiming they had orders to that effect.\" Serry expressed \"dismay\" over the incident, adding, \"I call on all parties to respect the right of religious freedom, granting access to holy sites for worshippers of all faiths and refraining from provocations, not least during the religious holidays.\" Yet Israel's government saw the matter in a different light. Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor -- in a message retweeted by Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner -- said, \"UN envoy #RobertSerry shows poor judgment in fabricating an incident out of a non-event, mishandling sensitive issue of religious freedom.\" Palmor told the Jerusalem Post that police were acting to limit the number of those packed into the church and the narrow streets around it, dismissing what happened as \"a micro-incident.\" This incident is not Serry's first run-in with authorities: The U.N. envoy said he was threatened by armed men in Crimea, which broke...",

Women wearing burqas in North West Frontier Province. The deal implements Islamic law, or sharia, in the Swat Valley region of North West Frontier Province. Last week, pro-Taliban cleric Sufi Mohammad announced he was pulling out of a peace deal for Swat Valley, saying the government was not serious about implementing Islamic law, or sharia, in the region. Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said Saturday the peace deal remained intact. Mohammad brokered a cease-fire in February between the Pakistani government and his son-in-law, Maulana Fazlullah, who commands the Taliban in Swat Valley. Although details of the deal were not immediately available, it was understood that the area will come under the Taliban's strict interpretation of sharia. The central government has little control in the area, but it launched an intense military offensive in late July 2008 to flush out militants from areas of the North West Frontier Province. As retaliation for the military presence, the Taliban carried out a series of deadly attacks, beheadings and destruction of girls' schools. They also continued to gain ground, setting up checkpoints throughout the area. Pakistan is under enormous pressure to control the militants within its borders. The militants are blamed for launching attacks in neighboring Afghanistan, where U.S. and NATO forces are fighting militants. Swat Valley was once one of Pakistan's biggest tourist destinations. It is near the Afghanistan border and is 186 miles (300 kilometers) from the capital, Islamabad.",

A day after his path to the GOP nomination cleared by chief rival Rick Santorum's withdrawal, Romney sought to reverse a gender gap problem by attacking Obama's economic policies as bad for women. According to a Washington Post/ABC News poll released Tuesday, Romney trails well behind Obama among women voters -- a result also seen in recent Gallup and CNN/ORC polls. Obama had the support of 57% of women, compared with 38% who said they backed Romney, while Romney had the backing of 52% of men, compared with 44% who backed Obama, the survey found. In a speech in Delaware at a woman-owned small business, Romney referred Wednesday to a Democratic attack line that Republicans were waging a \"war on women\" through socially conservative policies involving abortion, health care and other issues by saying: \"The real war on women is being waged by the president's failed economic policies.\" \"Now the president says, 'Oh I didn't cause this recession.' That's true,\" Romney said. \"He just made it worse, and made it last longer. And because it lasted longer, more and more women lost jobs, such that in his three-and-a-half years, 92.3% of the people who lost jobs have been women. His failures have hurt women.\" However, the nonpartisan website PolitiFact.com rated the 92.3% job loss statement \"mostly false,\" saying it included figures from the beginning of the Obama administration, before his policies could take effect. In addition, PolitiFact.com said the figure failed to reflect a historical pattern of recessions first causing unemployment in traditionally male-dominated industries such as construction, and then later affecting fields with larger percentages of female workers.

It's one of my favorite places to stay in the world. Next August, however, its main building is slated for tearing down to make way for a new, bigger hotel in advance of the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. Okura's problem is also its main appeal -- it seems stuck in time. Built in 1962, before Tokyo's last Olympics, the hotel is a masterpiece of Japanese aesthetics and modernist design that's remained largely untouched over more than five decades. It's hard not to fall in love with the elegance of the main lobby, lit by hanging, hexagonal lanterns and furnished with chairs and tables that resemble plum blossoms. The map with a Seiko clock -- displaying time zones in cities across the world -- still includes Leningrad as an option. The Bar Highlander whiskey lounge serves cocktails that have long fallen out of favor elsewhere in the world. Devoted staff look after customers with a level of devotion that's rapidly disappearing elsewhere. After helping me buy tickets to a baseball game in Yokohama last year, I was given a packet of directions not just to the city or the stadium, but to my actual seat. Not the time nor the place for progress . I even love all the things about the Okura that annoy my friends and colleagues. Though the rooms have been renovated since the '60s, they feel cramped and outdated by modern standards. Sending the most petite lady on staff to deliver 100 kilos of camera equipment to my room isn't a great display of hotel management. And the room service menu is, I think, the most expensive in Asia. (For the money, that better be the best burger in the entire world.) Somehow the origami turtle on my pillow seems to make up for all manner of faults.

She says that while the local campaign seems to be getting more donations this year, the demand also has risen. \"They go out as fast as they come in.\" As large boxes of toys make their way from the loading dock to the warehouse office, volunteers sort the toys by gender and age group and then fill orders they've received from various charitable organizations in the greater Boston area. \"It's been tough for everybody with the economic climate the way it is,\" says Betty Whalen, a volunteer who works sorting the toys. She points out the empty bins normally used to store the toys. Volunteers won't bother putting new donations in the bins, she says, \"because as soon as we sort all of this and start making up orders, it'll be gone.\" Last year the economy made it tough for many people, and Toys for Tots was hit hard as well.

            "(CNN) -- Keeping global warming down to a level people can live with means cutting carbon emissions to \"near zero\" by the end of the century, even in an increasingly industrialized world, the top U.N. experts on the issue reported Sunday. That may be doable, but it will take \"substantial investments\" in everything from planting more trees to replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon power sources like solar, wind and nuclear energy, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change announced in its latest report. \"What this report clearly shows is that the challenges to resolve the global common problem are huge,\" said Ottmar Edenhofer, a German economist and one of the lead authors of Sunday's document. \"But also this report shows that there are some steps to resolve this issue. I would say in that sense the report also outlines the challenges, but it provides hope -- modest hope.\" Jennifer Morgan, the director of the Climate and Energy Program at the World Resources Institute, agreed. \"The report shows that the scale of change require to tackle climate change is massive, but the ability to solve it is possible,\" she said Sunday. \"We need to do it quickly, before it will get so expensive to respond that we may hit the points of no return.\" Little time left to turn down the world's heat, U.N. says . 'Substantial investments' Edenhofer's modest hope will require more than tripling the share of electricity produced by renewable sources or nuclear power, along with refining the still-evolving technology of capturing carbon emissions and storing them underground. And it will take a coordinated global effort, likely including taxes on emissions, he said. No direct price tag was attached to that scenario, but Edenhofer said it would require \"substantial investments,\" and more delays just drive up the expected cost. The impact could amount to shaving the projected average growth of the global economy by six-hundredths of a percentage point -- from about 2% per year to 1.94% -- over the coming century.

        "Summarise the article:\n\n(CNN) -- HBO execs say they have nothing to worry about with \"Game of Thrones\" -- and not just because it's the most-nominated program at the Emmys this year. The fantasy series is based on George R.R. Martin's \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" book series, and as \"Game of Thrones\" approaches its fifth season, fans are concerned it'll soon run out of source material. But on Thursday, HBO CEO Richard Plepler and network Programming President Michael Lombardo assured reporters at the Television Critics Association press tour that \"Game of Thrones\" will get its fully story. \"George is an integral part of the creative team, so next season every move is being choreographed very closely with him,\" Lombardo said. \"Certainly after next year we'll have to figure it out with George, but we're not concerned about it.\" A rumored \"Game of Thrones\" movie isn't on the radar, but Plepler wouldn't dismiss it entirely. \"In my conversations with George, he's 100% focused on the books and the show,\" the HBO CEO said. \"GOT\" is HBO's most-watched series (ever), but \"True Detective\" is its newest gem. On Thursday, the freshman anthology series earned 12 Emmy nods, including nominations for best drama, best writing and two best actor nods for Season 1 stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. The show's structure presents a new cast of characters and story each season, and while Lombardo didn't have any casting news on Thursday he did drop a major tease for Season 2. \"The two scripts we have are -- I hate to jinx it -- but they are more exciting than the first season,\" he promised. \"True Detective\" creator Nic Pizzolatto was just as cryptic with The Daily Beast, saying little except that it will be set in California, and there are four central roles. \"We're not keeping any secrets, so when something concrete develops, we'll announce it to everybody,\" Pizzolatto said. \"But everything has just been empty rumors so far.\"",

Balotelli appeared to catch the side of Parker's head with his boot after the pair had clashed in the second half at the Etihad Stadium. And to compound the misery for Spurs, Balotelli went on to score a last-minute penalty in the top-of-the-table clash, with his winner putting City eight points clear of third-placed Tottenham. Manchester clubs sink London rivals to move clear at summit . An FA statement read: \"The FA has today charged Manchester City forward Mario Balotelli with violent conduct following an incident in his side's home game against Tottenham Hotspur. \"Balotelli was involved in an incident with Tottenham's Scott Parker during Manchester City's 3-2 victory at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday 22 January 2012. Balotelli has until 6 p.m. on Wednesday 25 January 2012 to respond to the charge.\" The incident angered Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp, who told reporters: \"I don't like people kicking other people in the head on a football pitch. \"It is not something I understand. Why should he go and back-heel someone in the head when he is on the floor?\" Should Balotelli be found guilty, he will be banned for four matches because he has been sent off once already this season. Balotelli would miss the Premier League trips to Everton and Aston Villa, plus the home encounter with Fulham and the second leg of the League Cup semifinal against Liverpool.

            "Los Angeles (CNN) -- A hearing in Charlie Sheen's custody battle with estranged wife Brooke Mueller took place Tuesday in private, despite a request from the actor's lawyer that reporters be allowed to witness the proceeding. While the results were sealed by the judge, Mueller was smiling broadly as she left court, in contrast to a stone-faced Sheen. Los Angeles County, California, Superior Court Judge Hank Goldberg granted Mueller's request for privacy, agreeing with her lawyer that the publicity would not be good for the couple's twin 2-year-old sons. About an hour after he entered the courtroom, the actor departed, strolling down the hallway with a woman on one arm and lawyers and guards surrounding him. He looked straight ahead as he moved to a non-public elevator for a departure from the basement garage. Mueller, surrounded by cameras and reporters as she left the courthouse, smiled but said little. Asked how she was doing, she said, \"Excellent, now let's go home.\" She then pushed through the scrum of media toward her limo. Sheen detoured Tuesday from the East Coast leg of his \"Violent Torpedo of Truth\" stage tour to ask Goldberg to award him full custody of the boys after Mueller failed to appear for a drug test that was required under their child-custody agreement. As he arrived Tuesday night in Washington for a performance, Sheen told a crowd of about 30 people gathered outside that he could not talk about his custody battle and didn't know the current status of his legal battle with Warner Bros. television over his firing from the CBS sitcom \"Two and a Half Men.\" His performance was pushed back an hour as he was traveling cross-country from the hearing. \"I was about to make a phone call and see how that thing went today,\" Sheen said. \"I just landed, got a police escort from the airport. We ran more red lights than Brooke Mueller going to a pawn shop.\" At the California hearing, Sheen's lawyer, Mark Gross, had argued that Mueller was \"a dollar short and a day late\" in asking for the case to be sealed..."

The Islamist militants renowned for their bloodthirsty beheading videos and slick social media propaganda, may have extended their skills into low-level hacking, a cyber-security human rights group believes. The Citizen Lab obtained new malware that has targeted the ISIS opposition group \"Raqqa is being Slaughtered Silently,\" or RSS, and released an analysis of it Thursday. The researchers from the University of Toronto can't confirm that the cyberattack is coming from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, especially since the Syrian regime led by Bashar al-Assad has also used Trojan horse software to fight activists since 2011. But the workings of the malware, its intended target and what it achieves for the attacker lead The Citizen Lab to suspect ISIS the most. ISIS hates RSS . ISIS is particularly motivated to strike RSS. The Islamist extremist militants like to depict their stronghold city of Raqqa to the world as a caliphate paradise, where life under strictest Sharia is practically Heaven on Earth. But RSS activists in the city reveal on social media Raqqa's bleeding underbelly, the terrorizing of residents. Warnings of graphic content speckle its Twitter feed, where photos of public beheadings and stonings of residents in Syrian cities are posted in unflinching detail. RSS also reports coalition airstrike hits against ISIS and warns Raqqa residents about new strict Sharia rules the militants impose on them. But activists participating in RSS activities have another enemy. Before ISIS took over their town, they were taking the same actions against the Syrian regime. Slapdash malware .

It's no use. The heartless thief takes her precious strappy sandals anyway. Ok, so while it's a pretty far-fetched story line -- how many criminals are going to spot a designer heel two meters away? -- it does point to the \"Sex and the City\" character's unhealthy obsession with the shoe label. Indeed, Manolo Blahniks were as much a part of the hit TV show's lexicon as Cosmopolitans and Rampant Rabbits. The six-year series introduced the Blahnik brand to millions of women across the world -- even if they could never actually afford them. Of course, Carrie's shoe infatuation wasn't just the stuff of fiction. Actor Sarah Jessica Parker -- who won four Golden Globes for her portrayal of the sassy New York columnist from 1998 to 2004 -- is a Manolo Blahnik diehard for real. So when she called up the coveted shoe company's chief executive, George Malkemus, on the off-chance he'd want to create a range together, she was delighted when the business mogul \"took on this little pipsqueak.\" \"I was terrified at picking up the phone and being bold enough to say to George: 'Would you ever consider a partnership?'\" says 49-year-old Parker, while sitting next to Malkemus in an interview with CNN's Maggie Lake. \"I was perfectly willing for him to say no, prepared for it in fact.\" \"But I did not say no,\" adds Malkemus, who had never worked with a female designer before. \"I said 'come to my office tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.'\" Accessible accessories? The shoes will cost between $195 and $500 and be sold at U.S. retail giant Nordstrom --a place partly chosen for its accessibility to a wider range of women. \"I have always felt that there was this group of 10 million women that I was honor-bound to in some way,\" said Parker. \"I wouldn't be having this opportunity if it weren't for the dedication and diligence with which they committed to the TV show and my character...",

        "Could you please generate a TLDR (Too Long Didn't Read) summary of the following news article?\n\nArticle: San Francisco (CNN) -- Mobile payments company Square is supersizing its hardware. On Tuesday, CEO Jack Dorsey unveiled the Square iPad stand, which the company hopes will replace traditional cash registers. The Square Stand is a white countertop unit that looks like a small iMac. It holds an iPad 2 or 3 and features a card reader that juts out on the bottom. It's the company's first piece of hardware since the original Square reader. The $299 unit includes a USB hub that can connect to third-party tools that traditional retailers still rely on, such as a cash drawer, receipt printer and barcode scanner. Square believes the future of payments isn't swiping a card but merely giving a cashier your name, which is stored within the company's database and linked to a credit card. But there are a lot of companies that still take cash, and customers who want paper receipts. Smaller mobile merchants such as food trucks, coffee shops and taxis have all flocked to the small Square reader, which plugs into an iPhone or iPad's headphone port. But Square wanted to create a product that could work for higher volume brick and mortar merchants, including those that still accept old-fashioned cash. Square also thinks that having a more solid physical register is a good move for smaller merchants. \"It adds this sense of security, validation that you're a business,\" Dorsey said at an event here. The Square Stand can be affixed to a table or drilled in through a hole in the counter for added security. It tilts and swivels around so customers can do their part, like adding a tip or signing their name. It connects to the iPad's dock connector instead of the audio jack, and the company said the credit card reader works every time a card is swiped. Dorsey wouldn't say if the readers were coming to Square partner Starbucks anytime soon, though he did say that the two companies were working together. According to Dorsey, Square didn't want to disrupt Starbucks' counter setup until it knew it had a product that could beat the speed of...",

Until recently, Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport had about 70 access points for what's called \"back of the airport\" employees, including baggage handlers and ramp workers. The workers were not subject to bag and body check screening when going to work. Before the new measures, employees only had to swipe their badges to gain access to secure areas of the airport. Now private security guards are checking their bags and personal belongings before they are allowed to enter a security door at the main terminal. \"There's a phased-in approach to get to full employee screening,\" airport spokesman Reese McCranie said. A day in the life of the Atlanta airport . In addition, after a CNN inquiry, airport officials closed one access point to the ramp used by Delta Air Lines employees arriving for work on the lower level of the airport. The employees have to punch in an access code to the door, and once inside, swipe their badges to go through another door. They still have access to the outer door, but the second inside door that leads to the ramp is now restricted. Delta subcontractors confirmed to CNN that employees could access the airfield after punching in their code and going through another door. \"Yeah, they can get into the terminal,\" the employee said. \"The break room allows you to go through a door where they have access to the mezzanine. The mezzanine is the outside where the planes are, it's where they do their work. They have other elevators that they can go through that'll take them up to the terminal.\" Within days of CNN's visit, the airport restricted access. \"The area that we visited ... that leads from the Delta break room to the baggage make-up area is being locked down,\" McCranie told CNN. \"It will remain an emergency exit per fire code.

Released in December 2009, just six months after the multiplatinum crooner pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna, \"Graffiti\" -- frankly, not a bad collection at all -- was widely panned. Everything from the title of his new disc, \"F.A.M.E.\" (an acronym for the off-putting title ''Forgiving All My Enemies''), to his recent nude photos and ill-advised tweets suggests that Brown has not yet mastered the art of image rehabilitation. Musically, though, he's in top form. \"F.A.M.E.\" (out March 22) shines brighter than anything he produced before that now-infamous incident. Melodic raps on tracks like ''Say It With Me'' and ''Oh My Love'' lead to intoxicating hooks, as do bedroom knockers ''Wet the Bed'' and ''No Bs,'' which for better (or worse) rival the bump-'n'-grind heights of '90s Casanova crew Jodeci. The uncertainty of love is a recurring theme on the album: On the thumping midtempo cut ''Next to You,'' Brown and guest Justin Bieber trade verses assuring their ladies of their dedication. The more relevant question is whether Brown can count on his old fans to be just as devoted. The fact that several singles have already crept into Billboard's top 20 is a good indication that he's winning them back. \"Graffiti\" clearly came too soon. And some still think Brown should go -- and stay -- away. But on its own merits, \"F.A.M.E.\" deserves to be heard. B+ . See full article at EW.com.

Dudes just don't dig bloodsuckers, since vampires pretty much look like girls. We prefer zombies, because we love chainsaws, flamethrowers, and samurai swords. And because, on some level, we know that besides being vehicles for sperm, our other important, if lesser, genetic imperative is to defend our loved ones from hordes of unthinking, flesh-eating metaphors for current social anxieties. To most guys, vampires are the monster movie equivalent of that sensitive man-sponge in college who plays acoustic guitar in order to seduce chicks. They're what you get when you cross your average Renaissance Fair enthusiast with a mosquito. And what's with their greatest weaknesses being most kinds of Italian food, Sunday school, and the sun, which helps flowers grow? Really? Why women find date-rapey parasites who wear capes compelling must have something to do with deeply primal fears. A vampire is a monster, who looks, acts, and talks like a man. Who is passionate, romantic, and tortured. To surrender to this character is to play with fire. The vampire, in many ways, is the prototype of the bad boy. Women love bad boys - they're exciting, and the chance to change him, to break him like a horse, must be an irresistible challenge. If self-destruction weren't seductive on some superficial level, then no one would ever need rehab. But I am like most guys in that I am a fan of zombie flicks. \"28 Days Later\" may possibly be my favorite movie ever. I'm also a fan of alien and robot movies, but more often than not, it seems women are more adept at dispatching those. Zombie movies indulge male power-fulfillment fantasies.

That adds up to an average of 2,221 people in the United States -- a conservative estimate, according to the CDC \u2014 dying annually, making it one of the leading preventable causes of death.  The numbers come from death certificate data collected from 2010 to 2012. Alcohol poisoning is when a person consumes a toxic amount of alcohol, usually after a binge of drinking. Typically, \"binge drinking\" for men involves consuming five or more alcoholic beverages in two to three hours, according to the CDC. For women it's drinking four or more in that same period. However, earlier research shows most of the 38 million or more Americans who admit to binge drinking say they actually drink about eight drinks in two to three hours and they do this on average four times per month. When you are suffering from alcohol poisoning, your liver can't keep up with the amount of alcohol in your body. Alcohol is a toxin and the liver has to filter it out of your blood. What the liver can't filter out backs up into your bloodstream. If the blood alcohol concentration in your bloodstream becomes too high, it has a severe impact on your mental and physical self. Your breathing could slow down and so could your heartbeat and your gag reflex. If these don't work correctly, you could lose your breath and pass out or you could stop breathing. Alcohol poisoning can also cause you to choke or cause your heart rhythm to become erratic. You could slip into a coma.  Other signs that someone may be suffering alcohol poisoning include severely slurred speech, loss of coordination and vomiting. While college students get a bad rap for binge drinking, the study found it's not typically college age people who die from drinking too much. In what the CDC said was a surprise, it found that white men between the ages of 35...",

        "Could you please generate a TLDR (Too Long Didn't Read) summary of the following news article?\n\nArticle: Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Authorities in Argentina's Tierra del Fuego province denied entry Monday to two cruise liners that were seeking to dock in the southern port of Ushuaia, in incidents linked to the political dispute over the Falkland Islands. The government was applying a provincial law barring ships traveling under British colony flags from docking at the port, said the state-run Telam news agency. Both ships were registered in Bermuda, a British territory. One of the ships -- the Star Princess -- departed Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on February 18 on a 14-night South America cruise. \"Because the ship had previously called at Stanley, it was denied entry to Ushuaia,\" said Julie Benson, a spokeswoman for Carnival Corp. She was referring to the port city in the Falkland Islands, which are referred to in Argentina as Las Malvinas. \"We are extremely disappointed about this alteration of the cruise itinerary, and are refunding the cost of shore excursions purchased by our passengers,\" she said in an e-mail. The ship is continuing to its next scheduled port of call, Punta Arenas, Chile. The 289-meter (nearly 950-foot) luxury liner, which has a capacity of 2,600 passengers, had docked in Ushuaia several times in recent years, she said. The P&O cruise liner Adonia, which is on a South American tour from Southampton, England, with an almost entirely British contingent of passengers, got a similar reception on Monday. The ship \"was this morning refused permission for its scheduled docking in the Argentinian port of Ushuaia by the local mayor on the grounds that it had visited the Falklands Islands two days before,\" said CNN contributor Robin Oakley, who was aboard the Adonis as a lecturer. Both P&O Cruises and Princess Cruises are Carnival Corporation cruise brands. The law cited was passed last August and refers to ships that carry out \"work related to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources, or to military vessels, within the ambit of the basin of the Malvinas Islands on the Argentinean...",

        "Extract key points from the article based on which the stock market could react:\n\nNew York (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's policy toward Syria -- three years of red lines and calls for regime change -- culminated Monday in a barrage of airstrikes on terror targets there, marking a turning point for the conflict and thrusting the President further into it. The U.S. said Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Jordan had joined in the attack on ISIS targets near Raqqa in Syria. The U.S. also launched airstrikes against another terrorist organization, the Khorasan Group. Obama described its members as \"seasoned al Qaeda operatives in Syria,\" and U.S. officials said the group was plotting attacks against the United States and other Western targets. Initially hesitant to become involved in the Syrian conflict, which pits an authoritarian regime led by President Bashar al-Assad against a patchwork of rebel groups, Obama has moved from sending weapons to opposition fighters last year, to backing away from airstrikes against al-Assad, to ordering Monday\u00b9s campaign to take out ISIS terrorists who have used the Syrian unrest to gain a foothold. Airstrikes: What you need to know . It\u00b9s new ground for the U.S., which lacks robust intelligence capabilities in Syria and hasn't sent any ground forces there. Unlike the campaign against ISIS in Iraq, the U.S. doesn\u00b9t have al-Assad\u00b9s permission to launch airstrikes in Syria, though the U.S. notified him before the attacks began. The coalition strikes began the evening before Obama made his annual visit to the United Nations General Assembly, where the White House hopes to secure broader support for the anti-ISIS campaign from a range of allies. The main focus, officials say, is on stemming the flow of foreign-born fighters who have joined up with ISIS and other terror groups in Syria and Iraq. The U.S. intelligence community believes there are 15,000 foreign fighters from 80 countries who are fighting alongside ISIS and other similar terror groups -- 2,000 from Europe and roughly 100 from the United States.

Ross and a female passenger were not hurt by the wreck or the gunshots, Garcia said. \"The suspects fled from the area prior to police arrival,\" she said.

Cochran and her grandmother had just enjoyed a hot dog at the Salem, Oregon, wholesale outlet. She had 7-day-old Derrik out of his baby carrier as she ate and people at nearby tables asked about the infant's age and expressed amazement that Cochran was already out and about after the pregnancy. She put Derrik back in his Infantino \"SlingRider\" and headed out to the parking lot, but something was amiss when she reached the car, she said. \"He was not the right color. He was yellow. He had purple spots from where the sling rubbed marks on his face,\" said Cochran, 27. Cochran called 911. Her fianc\u00e9, Jerrid Fowler, administered CPR. An ambulance arrived and paramedics also tried to revive the infant. \"By the time I got to the hospital, they told me they weren't able to save him,\" she said. Cochran filed a lawsuit in January, asking for millions of dollars in damages and alleging that Infantino was negligent and liable for her son's May 7, 2009, death. The death certificate cited compression asphyxia/suffocation as Derrik's cause of death, Cochran said. Infantino issued a recall Wednesday of two baby slings, the \"SlingRider\" and the \"Wendy Bellissimo,\" offering customers replacement slings. The San Diego, California-based company said consumers should stop using the recalled slings immediately but did not take responsibility for any deaths. \"Our company is comprised of moms, dads, sisters, aunts, uncles and grandparents and we care deeply about the quality and safety of our products,\" President Jack Vresics said in a statement. \"All of our products go through rigorous testing and we work closely with governmental agencies as well as other third-party testing organizations continually to ensure the safety of our products.\" Earlier this month, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning about the use of certain baby slings, saying it had identified 14 deaths...",

        [
            "(CNN)The cold gripping much of the eastern United States is bitter, it's sprawling, and it's deadly. And it's apparently not going away -- at least for any length of time -- anytime soon. From a frozen Niagara Falls to endangered Florida oranges, there's no shortage of evidence about how cold it has been over the past few days. But the worst such examples come in places like Tennessee, where 10 deaths have been blamed on the harsh winter weather, according to that state's emergency management agency. Four of the deaths stemmed from car accidents, and five were tied to hypothermia, which is abnormally low body temperatures that can cause confusion, sleepiness, slowed speech or reactions, and can be fatal if not treated quickly. The 10th death was a dialysis patient who was unable to get to treatment. Tennessee is hardly the only state affected. Some 185 million people are felling the deep freeze, with wind chill warnings and advisories posted for Thursday and Friday in more than 20 states. The National Weather Service notes that temperatures on Thursday were 25 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit below normal in some locales, where some records should smash like an icicle. Even Deep South states like Georgia and Alabama, and even Florida -- known more for sweltering than shivering -- have hard freeze and freeze warnings in effect. And no one should expect beach days in the immediate future. Instead, the weather service says, \"Get ready for an even more impressive surge of Arctic air later this week as another cold front drops south from Canada.\" \"There are indications\" its forecast adds, \"that this could be some of the coldest weather since the mid-1990s for some parts of the Southeast U.S., Mid-Atlantic, and central Appalachians.\" Things should warm up some over the weekend. But that doesn't mean East Coast residents can break out their swimsuits, what with yet more snow predicted Saturday and Sunday in places like Boston and a return to frigid temperatures next week.

In this case, it's a lawman -- specifically, a San Francisco street cop whose in-uniform images are making him a cyber-celebrity with a badge. San Francisco Police Officer Chris Kohrs -- the \"Hot Cop of Castro\" to his fans and friends -- became a viral sensation after a stranger created a Facebook page in his honor, nicknaming him after Castro Street, where Kohrs was posted at the time. The Facebook page has received close to 19,000 likes in about three weeks. \"I was out there one day doing traffic control and some guys asked if they could have photos of me and I consented. It kind of went viral from there,\" the 36-year-old Kohrs said in a phone interview with CNN. Kohrs' Facebook page creator Nathan Tatterson told CNN it all started with his friend's photo of Kohrs sitting on his motorcycle. \"Other people in the neighborhood starting recognizing the 'Hot Cop of Castro' and started taking and posting their own photos,\" said Tatterson. \"Once people started recognizing Officer Kohrs, they started chatting with him and realized that he wasn't just a pretty face. He was funny, nice, respectful, with a huge dose of charm and humility. He also clearly loved his job.\" User comments ranged from praise (\"One of San Francisco's Police Finest!\") to a touch risqu\u00c3\u00a9 (\"Crime has increased in the Castro with men of all stripes begging to be arrested and punished on the spot.\"). Kohrs, who has been on the police force for six years, said it was \"all a shock\" to him. \"I've never met the person that created the Facebook page. I'm not even on Facebook,\" he said laughing.

More than half of the workers made between $99,000 and $223,000. All the cases took place over the past five years. \"It is nothing short of disturbing that high-ranking officials within the SEC were spending more time looking at pornography than taking action to help stave off the events that brought our nation's economy to the brink of collapse,\" said Rep.

Democrats of all stripes, including Clinton allies, have predicted for months that the former Secretary of State -- who was campaigning for midterm candidates in Iowa on Wednesday -- will face some kind challenge in the race for the Democratic nomination if she decides to run. The prospect of a Clinton campaign seems more likely with each passing day. But with the presidential race set to lurch into gear after next week's midterm elections and no clear alternative to Clinton emerging, there are questions about whether she will be the sole candidate on the ballot. That would mark a dramatic shift from the rollicking caucus fights in previous campaigns, including Clinton's battle with Barack Obama and John Edwards in 2008. \"There is a distinct possibility that there will be no serious alternative,\" said Kurt Meyer, a plugged-in Democratic activist from Mitchell County, Iowa. \"She may in essence have the field to herself, with one or two fringe protest candidates and no serious candidates opposing her.\" The prospect of an uncontested race is a little bewildering to some Democrats here, where competitive caucuses are ingrained in the culture. \"It could be a process with just one person,\" said Bonnie Campbell, a longtime Clinton loyalist in Des Moines. \"None of us can imagine that, because it hasn't really happened before.\" For their part, the GOP isn't worrying about a boring race. A platoon of Republicans \u2014 Chris Christie, Rand Paul, Rick Perry, Ted Cruz and others \u2014 have paraded through Iowa for the last two years, almost shamelessly transparent about their national intentions.

        "Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?\n\nArticle: Washington (CNN) -- Former President George W. Bush said Tuesday that he wanted to publish his personal biography about his father, former President George H.W. Bush, now because \"I wanted Dad to be alive -- to be able to see how much not only I care for him but a lot of people care for him.\" \"His presidency in many ways was overshadowed by his predecessor, and that's understandable,\" Bush said. \"[But] people are beginning to reassess the presidency of 41 and I want to be a part of that process and I wanted him to know that that process was going to take place.\" Bush's comments came at an event with his father Tuesday marking the launch of the 43rd president's personal biography of the 41st president. The discussion was moderated by former George W. Bush chief of staff Andy Card and held at the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library at Texas A&M University in College Station. It was a heartfelt tribute to the elder Bush, who left the White House 22 years ago and is now 90. At 90, Bush 41 'enjoys life to the fullest' The younger Bush called \"41: A Portrait of My Father,\" \"a pretty good read\" about the man he said is the best one-term president in U.S. history. He said the inspiration came from a conversation with the daughter of renowned presidential biographer David McCullough, who told him that her father had always wished he could have read a book by John Quincy Adams about his father, John Adams. Bush said he thought: \"Well, I can do that.\" During the 45-minute event, the younger Bush told a number of stories about his father -- some funny and some touching. He said his father thinks about the men he served with when he was a pilot during World War II -- including radio man John Delaney and gunner Ted White, who died when their plane was shot down. The elder Bush was the only survivor. Bush said he didn't know until he started researching for the book that his father had invited the sisters of Delaney and White to visit him in the Oval Office. \"That's one of the most difficult aspects of the presidency is...",

While spokeswoman Leslie Scott applauded the crew of Flight 1651 for their \"vigilance\" after they alerted authorities to the boy, she sought to reassure travelers that the airline is going through the video as it reviews \"our policies and procedures to make sure something like this does not happen again.\" As of Monday, the boy was still in Las Vegas, where his status will be discussed in court Tuesday, a spokesman for Minnesota's Hennepin County said. Officials in Hennepin County are waiting until \"things are resolved out there\" before proceeding with the case, Chuck Laszewski said. The child's parents are said to be cooperating fully, CNN affiliate KARE reported. The boy went through security with other passengers, the Transportation Security Administration said in a statement Sunday, but officials are still trying to figure out how he did it -- and how he then got on the flight Thursday. Patrick Hogan, a spokesman for Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, said the crew \"became suspicious of the child's circumstances\" during the flight. Crew members got in touch with authorities in Las Vegas and turned the boy over to Child Protective Services, Hogan said in a statement. A longtime flight attendant told KARE that children who are traveling alone normally get special attention. \"It's a big responsibility for the airline as well as the flight attendant,\" Gregg Proteaux, a longtime flight attendant, told KARE. \"You're responsible for them. How do you let 110 people on board when you only have 109 boarding passes?\" The boy spent a good amount of time at the airport before boarding the plane, KARE reported. He was there the day before, the station reported, citing airport officials. He passed his time by taking luggage from a carousel, bringing it to an airport..."

It's a couple of hours before the duo's show on the first night of this year's Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, and Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney are hanging on a couch in a backstage trailer, checking out Pulp's opening set on a flat-screen TV. \"Holy smokes,\" Auerbach continues, as Cocker gesticulates at the huge crowd just a few yards from where the Keys sit. \"Man, he's going for it.\" Carney stares at the screen. \"Maybe we should take some theater lessons.\" \"I know, man,\" says Auerbach with a wry grin. \"We suck.\" This year marked the Black Keys' fifth trip to Coachella, and their debut as mainstage headliners. \"I like to remember the first time we played Coachella, in '04,\" Carney says. \"It was hot as f****** balls.

Alejandrina Gisselle Guzman Salazar was deported on Tuesday, her lawyer said, a day after she pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of a false visa. Shortly after Guzman Salazar's arrest in October, a U.S. federal official told CNN that she was the daughter of Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, who authorities have said heads Mexico's Sinaloa cartel. On Wednesday, her lawyers declined to comment on whether she was related to the accused drug lord. \"I don't know the answer to that, and it wasn't part of the case. ... We never asked, because it wasn't relevant, whether it was true or not,\" attorney Guadalupe Valencia said. Read more: Mexican police deny accused drug lord's government corruption claims . Another attorney for Guzman Salazar, Jan Ronis, said he watched her cross into Tijuana, Mexico, on Tuesday, but he declined to comment on where she headed after that. In October, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents arrested Guzman Salazar at the international crossing in San Ysidro, California. A spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment Wednesday on whether she had been deported, citing privacy rules. U.S. District Judge Cathy Ann Bencivengo ordered her released on time served after a hearing Monday, according to court documents. In a plea agreement, she admitted to possessing and attempting to use a fraudulent visa to gain entry to the United States. Guzman Salazar is between seven and eight months' pregnant, Valencia said. She entered with a false visa in October because she wanted to give birth in the United States, he said. \"All these facts were part of the public record that she wanted to come and have her baby here,\" he said. \"We live in the greatest country in the world, and people want to come here to live and give their kids an opportunity to be here, so that was it.\" Guzman Salazar is a doctor working as a general practitioner, he said. \"When she's back in Mexico, hopefully she can go on...",

        "Sum the following article in brief: London, England (CNN) -- Conservative Party leader David Cameron said it was \"clear that the Labour government has lost its mandate to govern this country,\" as exit-poll predictions put his party on course to win more seats than it had for 80 years. He said the Conservatives had fought a \"positive and energetic\" campaign. It was clear from the results that \"the country wants change\" and \"that change is going to require new leadership.\" Exit polls suggest the Conservatives are on pace to win 305 seats -- though this would be 21 short of a majority in the 650-seat House of Commons. Prime Minister Gordon Brown gave no indication early Friday that he would step down after being returned to parliament by his constituents in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. Full election coverage . The \"outcome is not yet known but my duty .. is to play my part in Britain having a strong, stable and principled government,\" he said. \"I will not let you down. \"I am very determined and have been through quite a lot in my political career and in my personal life, and I am used to difficulties.\" If the predictions are borne out by results, the UK is heading for a \"hung parliament\" in which no single party controls an overall majority. The leader of the largest party traditionally gets the first chance to form the government and become prime minister. But if no party has a majority, the sitting prime minister has the right to stay in office and try to win a confidence motion in parliament. \"The sitting prime minister and the incumbent government are given the first chance to create a majority that commands the confidence of the House of Commons, and if they fail to do that it passes to the leader of the opposition,\" top Labour politician Peter Mandelson told CNN. Brown arrived at Labour Party headquarters in London early Friday after flying in from Scotland. He smiled and shook hands as he entered the building with his wife, Sarah, but said nothing to waiting cameras and reporters. Several high-profile incumbents lost their seats overnight,...",

        "Summarise the article:\n\n(CNN) -- Violence in Mexico is back in the news and so is the perennial question: Is Mexico safe? In just the last few weeks there have been stories of 12 young people allegedly abducted in daylight from a Mexico City club; the death by beating of Malcolm X's grandson, also in the capital; the kidnapping of a U.S. Marine reservist from his father's ranch; the freeing of 165 people, including two pregnant women, who had been held prisoner; and the case of an Arizonan mom traveling on a bus who was arrested and jailed, accused of smuggling drugs. That's all before you look at the staggering toll of the years-long war between security forces and drug cartels -- at least 60,000 people killed in drug-related violence from 2006 to 2012, according to Human Rights Watch. Other observers put the number even higher. Disappearances in Mexico City linked to gang . Outside of war zones, more Americans have been killed in Mexico in the last decade than in any other country outside the United States, and the number of U.S. deaths jumped from 35 in 2007 to 113 in 2011. But those numbers do not lead to any simple conclusion. Millions of Americans visit Mexico every year without incident, and the number of tourists continues to grow. Nearly 6 million U.S. citizens visited Mexico in 2012, according to data from Mexico's tourism ministry. The first quarter of 2013 has seen a 5.9% uptick in American tourists compared to a year before, the ministry reported. Analysts and travel experts agree that security in Mexico varies -- sometimes dramatically -- from place to place. It's a contradiction -- Mexico is both as dangerous as ever or as safe as ever, depending on one's destination, actions and common sense. \"I think what you see in Mexico over the past few years is this movable target of what's safe and what's not safe,\" said Shannon K. O'Neil, senior fellow for Latin America studies at the Council for Foreign Relations. Of course you can be hurt anywhere, but the risks are different for a business trip to the capital, seeking sun...",

        "Sum the following article in brief: Prisons in developing countries can usually be characterized as hazardous and chaotic places for offenders. Due to limited resources, the prisons are left to be run by ruthless gangs. In the Pedrinhas prison in northern Brazil, the decapitation of inmates by a rival gang highlights \"the lawlessness\" within Brazil's correctional system. Prisons in the Philippines bear many similarities. However, the Philippine prison system is about to go through reformation following last year's passing of the Modernization Act by the Philippine Congress. Plans include the building of a new super-max facility to replace New Bilibid Prison (NBP) to reduce congestion and eliminate gangs within the system. But is this the right path? From over four years of ethnographic research we have conducted in NBP, we don't think so. Gangs dominate prison . NBP, on the outskirts of Manila, is one of the world's largest maximum-security facilities. Recent statistics we have collected from the Bureau of Corrections, which administers NBP, has the inmate population to be now exceeding 14,200. With space for only 5,500, this makes the congestion rate around 260 per cent. Around 95% of inmates belong to 12 gangs that share control of the prison. In these overcrowded conditions, corruption is endemic and contraband, such as drugs and high-calibre weapons, is readily available. Over the past three years, prison raids have uncovered automatic machine pistols and other lethal weapons held by gangs. Two M-16 hand grenades have also been thrown during gang disputes. We have observed how easy it is for inmates to acquire mobile phones. The telephones facilitate criminal activity on the outside to be freely run from the inside. From all this, one can easily conclude that, like Pedrinhas prison, NBP is dysfunctional. However, from participant observation studies and over 100 informal interviews with gang leaders, inmates and prison officials, we have developed an alternative perspective on prison gangs. Why gangs are important . While there is no doubt...",

Students in Dallas, Texas, had November 22, 1963, off from school in recognition of the visit. Warren decided to take along his 8mm camera. The result was \"the best home movie known to exist of the Kennedy arrival,\" according to Gary Mack, curator of the The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza. The color film offers new glimpses of the president and Mrs. Kennedy, wearing a pink Chanel suit, coming down the steps from Air Force One and greeting well-wishers. The Kennedys can then be seen from the side as they walk past the camera smiling. Vice President Lyndon Johnson is seen close up as he greets people standing on the tarmac. \"I was very excited,\" says Warren, now 61. \"It had rained the night before and cleared off that next day, which was an interesting event, and it was a very positive day. It was cool and yet the sun was shining bright, and there was lots of excitement.\" Warren donated the 8mm color home movie to the museum, Mack said in a news release. According to the news release, the only color images of President Kennedy in Dallas were made by amateurs, except for a brief film by a White House photographer. The museum is on the sixth and seventh floors of what was known in 1963 as the Texas School Book Depository. The Warren Commission determined that Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy from that location."

Mixing the idea of Google's Street View with multi-spectral thermal camera technology, Massachusetts-based startup Essess is building a giant database mapping residential and commercial properties in the U.S. The project is the idea of Sanjay Sarma, professor of mechanical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who wanted to create a way of identifying and remedying inefficiencies in buildings. Essess currently has a fleet of five cars mounted with thermal cameras that take a matter of seconds to assess an individual building. The brighter the colors, the greater the \"heat leak.\" Company CEO, Storm Duncan says they are capturing around two to three million buildings per month at the moment. \"The purpose of the approach is to provide a snapshot of the energy efficiency. It answers about 20-30% of the problems of your home.\" Duncan said. \"I consider it a fabulous way to start a broader dialogue about the more comprehensive (energy) profile,\" he added. Essess have also developed computer programs that generate energy reports highlighting specific areas of concern and calculating their cost -- financially and environmentally. The beauty of the reporting system (see gallery) is its simplicity, says Duncan, with consumers immediately getting a sense of how efficient their homes really are. The database will also create what he calls \"an eco-system around building efficiency\" becoming the cornerstone of a competitive hub where homeowners can link up with specialists who can remedy problems. Buildings consume around 40% of the U.S.'s total energy requirements annually, according to the Department of Energy, with over one third of that power going to waste. The company is evolving a business model which Duncan hopes will mean customers won't pay a cent to view information about their home. Instead, audits will potentially become part of the service provided by...",

The Serbian appeared on course for an easy victory after winning the first set, but the 24-year-old completely lost his cool as his 30th-ranked opponent fought back in the second. Djokovic was given a warning after smashing his racket into the ground three times, a petulant outburst that ensured the Centre Court crowd was firmly behind Baghdatis -- a 2006 semifinalist here after losing in the final of that year's Australian Open. Djokovic, seeking his first Wimbledon title after his 43-match unbeaten run ended at the French Open semifinals, recovered his poise to triumph 6-4 4-6 6-3 6-4 and set up a fourth-round clash with France's Michael Llodra. Baghdatis will not feature when the second week of the tournament begins on Monday, but the 26-year-old won plenty of fans with his big-hearted performance as he tested Australian Open champion Djokovic right until the end -- even winning an 18-shot rally despite his tiring legs. \"To pull a win out of this game was great.

He was the kind who would stand in the corner at a party swaying side-to-side, quietly sipping on a beer while others danced and socialized. \"We called him Fudgie,\" Marlon's cousin, Juarez Jackson, said. \"Fudgie was a great cousin with a smile that could light up an entire room. He was not the person with the most words, but he had a great sense of humor and personality.\" CNN first learned about Marlon when his name was added to the Home & Away database, an interactive memorial for the troops who have lost their lives fighting in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Thanks to Juarez, we were given an opportunity to learn more. Marlon was nicknamed Fudgie after a character in a reggae song who was known for being outgoing and was quite the ladies man, someone who Marlon was not. Juarez, a native of Kingston, Jamaica, explained that it is common in Jamaican culture to give someone a nickname that is opposite of who they really are. \"If someone's big, we call them smally. If they're tall, we call them shorty,\" Juarez said. \"It was kind of a play on him not being that outgoing and him being a real introvert.\" Marlon was born in Jamaica and adopted at nine by Leighton Jackson and Lois La Grenade and a few years later, he moved to New Jersey with his adopted father. Around 14, his cousins in Georgia, who he would visit often, dubbed him Fudgie. He often introduced himself to others using the obverse nickname. \"He loved it,\" Juarez said. \"Everybody called him Fudgie, and he got a big kick out of it.\" Marlon might have been quiet, but according to Juarez, when he did talk, he always had something interesting to say. \"Some people, they don't need to say anything and they just have that way about them,\" Juarez said. \"Everyone listened when he said something because he rarely spoke. (Marlon was) just very on point with the words that came out of his mouth.\" But when Marlon enlisted with the U.S. Army in 1999, Juarez saw a big change in his cousin's personality. He started...",

        "In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?\n\nArticle: (CNN) -- Chinese New Year is a dangerous time for pet dogs in Thailand. Traditionally the time of peak demand for dog meat in Vietnam, the dog smugglers of the Mekong work deep into the night shipping thousands of animals -- sometimes dozens to a cage -- across the river border with Laos to be trucked on to the dinner tables of the nouveau riche in Hanoi. \"I'd say about 98% of them are domesticated -- a lot of them are stolen pets,\" says John Dalley of the Phuket-based Soi Dog Foundation. Soi is a Thai word meaning backstreet or alley. \"They've been trained and respond to commands, some of them are even still wearing collars,\" he says. Gathering dogs for market was once simply a matter of exchanging plastic buckets for the many soi dogs that live around Thai towns and villages. But with demand soaring in the winter months -- dog meat is regarded as a \"warming\" food and one that is believed to confer good luck in Vietnam -- it's a sellers' market. \"The sheer number of dogs required means this method is no longer sustainable and rustlers will travel across most of Thailand in search of dogs,\" says Dalley. \"Some are bought. Others are snatched from streets, temples, and even people's gardens.\" The recent floods in Thailand have also been a boon for dognappers for whom lost and displaced dogs are an easy target. Some operators simply drive around in pickups collecting dogs as they spot them. \"One pickup truck stopped in September had 130 dogs in sacks piled in the back,\" says Dalley. \"More than 30 of the dogs were already dead from suffocation.\" The trade is illegal in Thailand and while authorities have made a number of raids involving thousands of dogs, the Thai Veterinary Medical Association estimates as many 500,000 dogs are sold across the Mekong every year. This month, a Thai navy patrol rescued 800 dogs packed into 40 wire cages on a six-wheeled truck on the banks of the Mekong River in Nakhon Phanom province. Police said they made one arrest but the other smugglers disappeared into the night. Mekong...",

Quintana Roo Attorney General Francisco Alor said through a spokesman that the investigation file, with recommended charges, was sent to the judge on Friday. \"It is our understanding that the issuance of an arrest warrant normally entails a detailed judicial review that takes anywhere from several weeks to several months,\" Hirsch said. \"It appears that the way this matter is being handled constitutes a rush to judgment.\" Bruce Beresford-Redman was briefly detained after Monica Beresford-Redman's body was found in a sewer at the Moon Palace Resort on April 8. His passport was taken by investigators and he was told not to leave Mexico until the probe was concluded. The former producer on TV's \"Survivor\" recently returned to his Los Angeles, California, home, to take care of family business and see his two young children, his lawyer said. His lawyer issued a statement from Beresford-Redman Monday after learning of the arrest warrant. \"I am devastated at her loss,\" Beresford-Redman said in the statement, \"and I am incensed at the suggestion that I could have had anything to do with her death. I am innocent. My children have had one parent taken from them by a senseless act of violence. I implore the Mexican authorities not to take their remaining parent by a miscarriage of justice and to do what is right,...",

In an effort to prevent cervical cancer, which can be caused by HPV, public health officials have been encouraging young women to get vaccinated since the Food and Drug Administration approved the first HPV vaccine, Gardasil, in 2006. The vaccine has been approved for boys and men since 2009, but health officials and doctors haven't pushed it with the same urgency. \"Because the story started with cervical cancer, the studies started with females,\" says the lead author of the study, Anna Giuliano, Ph.D., of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute in Tampa, Florida. \"The study of HPV in men is a late bloomer.\" Health.com: 12 vaccines your child needs . Gardasil is given in a series of three injections. In the study, which included more than 4,000 sexually active males between the ages of 16 and 26, roughly 0.5 percent of the boys and men who received all three shots developed genital warts during the subsequent 2 to 3 years. By contrast, about 2.8 percent of the study participants who received a placebo vaccine developed warts. The vaccine also reduced the risk of contracting an HPV that persists for at least six months, though not as dramatically. HPV can cause certain cancers of the anus and penis in men, although those diseases are far less common than cervical cancer in women. The study was designed and funded by Merck, the maker of Gardasil (also known as Silgard). The National Institutes of Health also provided funding.

            "(CNN) -- If you're Barack Obama or Mitt Romney, you'll get one more hour to scour for votes ahead of Tuesday's presidential election. If you're spending a night out on the town, that could translate to 60 more minutes dazzling the dance floor. And if you're tired, or perhaps lucky, that means one more hour of sleep. Daylight Saving Time may bring health problems . All options are on the table this weekend, when U.S. residents turn back the clock as part of the semi-annual daylight saving routine. At 2 a.m. Sunday, people will \"fall back\" one hour -- in essence, allowing them to relive the 1 a.m. hour two times over. The change affects all those in the United States except for people in Hawaii and parts of Arizona who do not observe daylight saving time. The territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and American Samoa also do not recognize the change. For those who do change the digits on their clocks, the sun will seem to come up earlier in the morning and it will set earlier at night, relative to conditions just a few days earlier. The idea for daylight saving came from legendary American inventor, statesman and founding father Ben Franklin who, in a 1784 letter to a French journal, suggested that Parisians could save thousands of francs annually by waking up earlier in the summer so they wouldn't have to buy so many candles to light the evening hours. TIME: 8 ways to beat the winter blues . The United States didn't adopt the practice until the 20th century -- for a brief time during World War I, again during World War II and on a state-by-state basis in the years after the war. It became a national policy, with some tinkering, beginning in 1966. Dozens of other countries now observe some form of daylight saving as well. The extra hour that people will get this weekend will only last so long. Americans will have to give it back by \"springing forward\" -- and turning ahead their clock -- one hour on March 10, 2013."

The interview covers a broad range of topics tied to Bush's response to the attacks -- a response which remains a source of deep political division both within the United States and overseas. \"We could see in the interview that the president was very taken by the events of that day,\" Schnall said. \"He was very emotional.\" Bush told Schnall that initially he thought a light aircraft had hit one of the towers at New York's World Trade Center. \"First I thought it was a light aircraft and my reaction was, man, either the weather was bad, or something extraordinary happened to the pilot,\" Bush said in the interview. But then-White House Chief of Staff \"Andy Card's Massachusetts accent was whispering in my ear -- 'A second plane has hit the second tower.

Chris Lewis joined Surrey to play in Twenty20 matches for the 2008 season. The 40-year-old all-rounder, who played 32 Tests and 53 one-day internationals for England in the 1990s, was arrested Monday when border officials at London's Gatwick Airport found cocaine hidden in luggage that had arrived on a flight from the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. Four kilograms of cocaine with a street value of around $350,000 was seized by the UK Border Agency, the UK's Press Association said. The drugs were in a liquid form hidden in fruit tins, officials said. Lewis and basketball player Chad Kirnon, 26, both from London, were held and questioned by Customs officials and later charged. British Revenue & Customs spokesman Bob Gaiger told PA: \"This was an excellent detection by UK Border Agency officers. \"HMRC, together with UKBA, play a vital role in the fight to prevent illegal drugs from entering the UK and in protecting our communities from the violence and corruption that always accompany this hideous trade.\" The two men made a brief appearance at Crawley Magistrates' Court in West Sussex on Tuesday afternoon, where Lewis had a bail application refused, PA reported.

Yet in the years since leaving the isolated enclave of Manhattan, I've taken pleasure in expanding my horizon and checking off all-American rites of passage, most recently, the baseball spring training road trip. By now, it's a familiar tradition: as spring approaches, Major League Baseball teams head for camps in Florida and Arizona to work off the winter flab and get ready for the regular season.

A new era of enhanced training facilities and stadiums have all the 21st-century bells and whistles, but in some respects, spring training is still a throwback to a more casual, pastoral brand of baseball. My initiation was an abbreviated tour, three games in three stadiums, with a beach condo in Indian Shores as home base.

Turney posted videos showing the helicopter arriving on a makeshift helipad on the ice near the trapped ship and taking off into the crisp blue sky.

It remained calm Wednesday morning as people sought to go about their normal business. On Wednesday evening, M23 rebels were seen packing their equipment to possibly move out of Goma, but the group continued to give mixed signals about whether they would go. The M23 helped orchestrate a rally of mostly young men to show who supported the group. Several hundred protesters carried placards calling for President Joseph Kabila to stand down and saying \"yes to the revolution.\" Some complained about tribal discrimination.

Nixon offered money or other discreet aid for the effort if it could be made available, the document shows. \"We must try and prevent new Allendes and Castros, and try where possible to reverse these trends,\" Nixon said. Medici said he was \"happy to see that the Brazilian and American positions and views\" were so close. The declassified document, a previously top secret memorandum for Nixon's file written by National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, was published by the National Security Archive, a nongovernmental research institute in Washington. The memorandum, along with other documents, were declassified in July as part of the State Department's Foreign Relations of the United States series. \"This is an explosive document that details collusion between the colossus of the North [the United States] and the colossus of the South [Brazil],\" said Peter Kornbluh, the director of a Chile and Brazil Documentation Project for the National Security Archive. He called it \"a smoking gun of confirmation of Brazil's effort to engage in operations to overthrow the government of Chile and a discussion of collusion with the United States.\" The two leaders also discussed the creation of a back channel for direct communication outside normal diplomatic protocols, according to the document.

The president and his supporters from the powerful Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist factions have argued that the move was essential to protect the country's recent revolution. However anti-government protesters viewed the move as a power grab, and have clogged the city's streets fighting pitched battles with pro-government demonstrators ahead of the country's vote on its new constitution on December 15.

        "Sum the following article in brief: Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A court in Pakistan reissued an arrest warrant Saturday for former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf in connection with the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, a public prosecutor told CNN. Prosecutors claim that an investigation shows Musharraf was responsible for not providing adequate protection for Bhutto and has not responded to a prosecutor's request to answer questions, prompting the court-ordered arrest warrant. Authorities were unable to serve an arrest warrant issued last week because Musharraf is not in Pakistan, prosecutor Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali told CNN. Ali said the court ordered authorities to serve the new warrant at all of Musharraf's residences, including those abroad. Musharraf is currently living in self-imposed exile in London. Ali said the court was adjourned until March 5. Bhutto, who spent many years in exile, was assassinated in 2007 as she campaigned against Musharraf for the presidency. Some have accused Musharraf of being involved in the assassination, but Musharraf denies any involvement. Late last year, Pakistani authorities arrested two police officials in the case. A United Nations panel looking into Bhutto's assassination concluded that Pakistan's former military-led government failed to adequately protect her and that intelligence agencies hindered the subsequent investigation. The panel's scathing report in April 2010 said the suicide bombing that killed Bhutto \"could have been prevented\" and that police deliberately failed to pursue an effective investigation into the killings. But Musharraf's government has said Bhutto had been afforded adequate protection. Musharraf's legal adviser told CNN that Musharraf has not appeared before the court because the accusations against him are baseless and politically motivated. \"This is political victimization against Musharraf,\" Muhammad Ali Saif said. \"Musharraf was never contacted by investigators to get his version of the assassination.\" Musharraf went to London after resigning in...",

Sri Lanka's Mahinda Rajapaksa concedes defeat to opposition candidate Maithripala Sirisena in the country's presidential election, prime minister-designate Ranil Wickremesinghe tells CNN. [Previous story, posted at 8.17 p.m. ET] . (CNN) -- In November, when Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa called an election two years earlier than necessary, the path ahead looked clear for an unprecedented third term in office. But as the nation of 15 million eligible voters waits for the results of yesterday's polls, the 69-year-old's electoral ambitions may be in jeopardy. After enabling an extension of his presidency by doing away with a two-term limit, Rajapaksa's campaign was spectacularly wrong-footed by the surprise defection of dozens of political allies -- including the man who now threatens to unseat him. Maithripala Sirisena, 63, was general-secretary of Rajapaksa's Sri Lanka Freedom Party and health minister in his cabinet when he defected. He is now challenging him for the presidency, on behalf of a broad opposition alliance analysts describe as the most serious challenge Rajapaksa has faced. The race -- which watchdogs say has been marred by hundreds of incidents of political violence and government misuse of state media -- has been too close to call. Opinion polls and analysts spoken to by CNN are divided on the outcome. \"It's not auguring very well for (Rajapaksa). He's got a contest on his hands,\" said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of Sri Lanka's Center for Policy Alternatives. He said Rajapaksa, accustomed to a weak and fragmented opposition, could not have anticipated facing a united alliance of nearly 40 parties -- including 23 parliamentarians who have defected from the president's own grouping, as well as nationalists from the Sinhalese majority and Tamil and Muslim minorities in the ethnically diverse nation. \"He didn't expect the candidate to be Sirisena,\" said Saravanamuttu. \"I think he probably underestimated the...",

Entrepreneur Ashar Aziz has donated the remaining half of the $1 million Babar Suleman and his 17-year-old son Haris were hoping to raise for a Pakistan charity that helps poor children go to school. The Sulemans' plane crashed into the Pacific Ocean near American Samoa on July 22, ending a voyage that was months in the making and would have taken the father-son duo on a 26,500 mile adventure around the world in 30 days in their single-engine plane. Had they completed the flight, the teenager would have been the youngest pilot to achieve the feat. \"I was deeply saddened and shocked to hear of the tragic end of Babar and Haris' fundraising mission,\" said entrepreneur Ashar Aziz. Aziz was a high school classmate and friend of Babar Suleman. \"I felt that the best way to honor this brave father and son duo was to complete their mission of raising $1 million for the charity that was dedicated to providing free education for the underprivileged.\" The Sulemans were raising money for the Indiana-based group Seeds of Learning, which supports the work of The Citizens Foundation in Pakistan. They had raised half their goal when their Beechcraft Bonanza A36 crashed into the Pacific 23 miles from the island.

President Obama made veterans' affairs a big priority in the 2008 campaign and continues to do so. The joint virtual lifetime electronic record will, among other things, help ensure a streamlined transition of health care records between the Pentagon and the Veterans Administration. It will provide \"a framework to ensure that all health care providers have all the information they need to deliver high-quality health care while reducing medical errors,\" the White House said in a background statement. \"When a member of the armed forces separates from the military, he or she will no longer have to walk paperwork from a [Defense Department] duty station to a local VA health center. Their electronic records will transition along with them and remain with them forever,\" Obama said in remarks delivered near the White House. The system will \"cut through red tape\" and allow new veterans to start receiving their benefits more quickly, he promised. During the announcement, Obama was joined by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. \"We welcome this news. ... This is a huge day for veterans and troops,\" Paul Rieckhoff, head of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, told CNN. \"This is a good way for [Obama] to come back from Iraq and make a powerful statement.\" The White House recently proposed a significant budget increase for the Veterans Administration, including an 11 percent hike in fiscal year 2010. In March, however, the administration abandoned a controversial plan to charge private insurers for treatment of veterans' service-connected ailments. Veterans' representatives and members of Congress angrily opposed the proposal, which White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said was never finalized.",

        "Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?\n\nArticle: (CNN) -- Democrats will soon return to the airwaves in Kentucky to back Alison Lundergan Grimes, according to a source at the Democratic Senatorial Congressional Committee. The decision comes as Democrats insist polls show their candidate, Lundergan Grimes, can still win in her race against Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. As of last week, the DSCC had not purchased airtime for Lundergan Grimes at all through the end of the campaign. That news got out the morning after she was roundly criticized for awkwardly refusing to answer questions about whether she voted for President Barack Obama. But polling suggests Lundergan Grimes is still competitive. A Courier-Journal/Survey USA poll of voters from Oct. 15-19 found McConnell up by just one point. The DSCC source said their polling suggests undecided voters are moving toward Grimes, though there's little public data to back that up. Even last week when they conceded they had no plans to air TV ads for Grimes, national Democrats still promised to spend money on the ground to get out the vote. The reality is that the back and forth about money for TV ads is more symbolic of how national Democrats view Lundergan Grimes' chances -- and perhaps differences with locals over how to run the campaign -- than it is practical . Kentucky is flush with cash from both the campaigns and outside groups and sources in both parties concede at this point neither candidate will win or lose for lack of money.

        "Condense the article down to the essentials to present it in the form of short cards in mobile news apps:\n\n(CNN)Everything was going to plan for Cowdenbeath during its Scottish Championship clash with table-topping Heart of Midlothian Saturday. The game was 25 minutes old and the relegation threatened-side, ironically and lovingly nicknamed the Blue Brazil by Scottish football fans, had managed to shut-out their hosts and in-form opponents. Then, the goals began to arrive. Minutes 26, 27 and 29 saw Hearts Dutch striker Genero Zeefuik grab a quickfire hat-trick, the third after a penalty and red-card to Cowdenbeath defender Lewis Toshney. A brief lull followed before Hearts scored again in minutes 33 and 39 through Sam Nicholson and Jamie Walker respectively. And while half-time provided Cowdenbeath some brief respite, another torrent of goals was to come when play resumed. By the end of the 90 minutes, Hearts had scored five more times to ensure an astonishing 10-0 victory. Morgaro Gomis, Alim Ozturk Danny Wilson and substitute Osman Sow (twice) did the second-half damage. \"I've never been involved in a result like that in my entire career,\" said Hearts head coach, Robbie Neilson after the game. \"I spoke to the players at half time and told them to keep going, try to score more,\" he added. The result matches Cowdenbeath's heaviest ever loss, an 11-1 reverse to Clyde way back in 1951. But that's still nowhere near the record of the biggest defeat ever recorded in senior Scottish football. That distinctive honor remains in the possession of wonderfully named Bon Accord who were trounced 36-0 by Arbroath in 1880. It might be little consolation to Cowdenbeath tonight, but at least they were along way off Bon Accord levels of ineptitude.",

Zelaya supporters burn tires Monday near the presidential palace in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa. The Telesur TV network showed soldiers advancing on some streets of the capital, Tegucigalpa, and blue-helmeted police clashing with noisy demonstrators, one day after military troops detained Zelaya and sent him into exile. Other images showed troops, tanks and other military assets deployed around the presidential grounds. The station, a conglomerate formed by several Latin American governments and partially funded by the pro-Zelaya Venezuelan government, also aired images of demonstrators setting fires in the streets. Gauging the size and scope of the demonstrations and clashes was difficult because of limitations that journalists reported. Adriana Sivori, a reporter for Telesur, reported that she and other journalists were briefly detained and mistreated by Honduran soldiers. She was live on television as she described the troops transporting them at gunpoint. Two national television stations were taken off the air following Sunday's military-led coup, and a third station told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol that its content was being limited by authorities.

White sand beaches busy from sunup to sundown; the souvenir shop running out of bikinis, boogie boards, airbrushed sand dollars and decorative hermit crab shells; more stop than go on the two-lane road that cuts through the island; more bathing suits than socks in the wash. There should be a wait for martinis at The Jellyfish Bar, a wait for oysters at the Flora-Bama lounge, a wait for coffee at Lost Key Java, a wait for fresh snapper at Perdido Bay Seafood. It is summer in name only on this narrow band of beaches. After oil spilled from a BP well and flowed toward Florida's panhandle, almost no tourists came to stay. Residents are losing their jobs. They're learning it doesn't matter if the sand looks pristine at the moment; oil slick and tar balls could return at any time, and people are afraid. \"Bartenders are trained to hear people's problems, make them feel better, but every single person that comes in here has the same problem,\" said Marcus Story, who opened the Jellyfish here four years ago, and usually pays his bills for the year with money earned during summer but can't afford to this year. \"The stress -- they can't sleep, everybody's irritated, everybody's on edge. I'm tired of thinking about it.\" Perdido Key, Florida, has a reputation as the place to unwind, a haven from bigger, busier Pensacola, Florida, and Orange Beach, Alabama, just down the road. Its name translates to \"Lost Key,\" and it's home to about 2,000 full-time residents, 3,400 rental condos and not a single hotel. More than half its area is taken up by undeveloped state and national parkland. Tourism is its greatest economy, and untouched beaches its best selling point.

It's a transformation that has taken place over decades: From the shaggy-haired, scrawny commander of Irish Republican Army (IRA) gunmen in the early 1970s, to the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland's power-sharing government, where he represents Sinn Fein, the province's most popular, mainly Roman Catholic, Republican party opposed to British rule. In his home city of Londonderry I saw that fear firsthand while shooting a documentary about him a little over a decade ago. McGuinness had long been rumored to have had a direct hand in the killing of an IRA man turned informer. I visited the man's mother, who lived just a few streets away from McGuinness's modest terraced house in the city's notorious Bay Side neighborhood. The killing had allegedly taken place decades earlier but the man's mother was still too afraid to talk. Queen arrives in Northern Ireland on jubilee visit . Derry, as he would call his city, or Londonderry, as the province's mainly Protestant, pro-British Loyalists refer to it, was where McGuinness first tried his hand at politics. While shooting the documentary I met with one of his former political colleagues who also was a secret agent for the British government. He had been pulled out and relocated to mainland Britain when his cover was blown a long time ago, but he told me he warned his British government handlers that McGuinness's early ballot box victories were a fraud: Countless ballots cast in clear infringement of the law.

Ashin Kovida made a narrow escape from Myanmar's military regime. \"The soldiers started shooting and I had a narrow escape, I saw monks being beaten,\" he told CNN, describing his exit. His main offense? Acting as a key organizer of protest marches that slowly escalated until thousands took to the streets in a movement underscoring the people's desire for pro-democracy leadership. The uprising, dubbed the Saffron Revolution for the monks' saffron-colored robes, lasted for several weeks before being snuffed out by the iron hand of the ruling junta. The protests were initially sparked by a huge fuel price increase imposed by the military government. They quickly became much more. Video smuggled out of the secretive country has shown unarmed protesters being beaten by government security forces, and one man -- believed to be a Japanese journalist -- shot and killed at close range. U.N. envoy Paulo Sergio Pinheiro has said as many as 110 people were believed to have been killed during the demonstrations -- including 40 Buddhist monks -- and 200 others beaten. The regime has since admitted to detaining more than 2,900 people, but hundreds more remain in custody, some facing deplorable conditions. Myanmar's humanitarian crisis has sparked international outrage, concern, attention and brought new focus to Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate who has been under house arrest on and off for nearly 20 years in Yangon, the country's biggest city. Pitting his Buddhist faith against Myanmar's oppressive military regime, Kovida described what inspired him to take a stand. \"I was an ordinary monk, but then I heard about the death in Bokoku I was surprised no monks came onto the streets,\" he said, describing an incident in...",

Tuvalu hopes to set an example to bigger nations by relying totally on clean energy by 2020. Located between Hawaii and Australia, the tiny Pacific nation is one of the world's climate change hotspots and many believe it is already seeing the negative affects of rising sea levels. The highest elevation on the island is just 4.5 meters (14.8 feet), and king tides have become increasingly damaging over the past 10 years, threatening the homes and livelihoods of its 12,000 inhabitants. The government of Tuvalu is working with the e8, a consortium of 10 energy firms from the G8 nations that was set up after the 1992 Rio Earth Summit as a non-profit organization. The Tuvalu government estimates that it will take around $20 million in investment to reach the goal of 100 percent clean energy by 2020. The first stage of the project has seen the roof of the country's largest football stadium covered in solar panels, which supplies 5 percent of the electricity needed by the nation's capital, Funafuti. According to e8 figures, after 14 months in operation the solar stadium has reduced consumption of generator fuel shipped from New Zealand by 17,000 tons and saved 50 tons of CO2 from being released in the atmosphere. A further benefit is the reduced risk of diesel spills around the atoll's reefs. \"There may be other larger solar power installations in the world, but none could be more meaningful to customers than this one,\" said Takao Shiraishi, general manager of the Kansai Electric Power Company that helped implement the scheme. \"The plight of Tuvalu versus the rising tide vividly represents the worst early consequence of climate change. For Tuvalu, after 3,000 years of history, the success of UN climate talks in Copenhagen this December may well be a matter of national survival,\" he said in a press statement. The next scheme is building a solar power system for a secondary school...",

            "(CNN) -- Let's be clear about one thing: Vice President Joe Biden's recent comment about being OK with marriage equality did not place the president in a difficult situation. The president placed the president in a difficult situation the day he decided to push his conscience back into the closet. In 1996, when Barack Obama first ran for state office, he was in support of marriage equality. But once he started targeting the national stage, he became less supportive. Today he says he's \"evolving,\" which seems to be shorthand for, \"Back off, I don't want to lose this election.\" To be fair, Obama's not the first politician to rewrite his history for political gain and he certainly won't be the last (right, Mitt?). And without question Obama has done more to help the gay community than any other president. But this awkward dance he's doing with the issue of same-sex marriage is a self-inflicted wound to his integrity. All Biden did was speak from the heart. Just because the president lacks the fortitude to do the same does not mean the campaign should try to massage Biden's words to mean something other than their original intent. Besides, Biden's comments, along with Education Secretary Arne Duncan, may feel good, but they're not moving any needles. There is no real pressure the gay community can put on the president, because the reality is the gay community doesn't have any leverage. It's either Obama or the guy who vows to push a Constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages. No, the only question is how many days President Obama will allow his legacy to reside on the wrong side of history. How many pages of his future biographies does he want dedicated to him not supporting this issue? Thirty years from now, when the CNN specials are aired and the documentaries made, how much footage does Obama want his grandchildren to see of him ... \"evolving\"?

Ministers are to risk a major row over immigration by scrapping the ten-yearly National Census after more than 200 years. An announcement axing the survey is expected this month, together with moves to find cheaper ways of counting the population. But the Government faces accusations of trying to hide the truth about immigration. Ten-yearly National Census that counts the number of people living in UK will be scrapped after 200 years . The future of the census has been in question since the disastrous 2001 survey led to bureaucratic chaos and a final population figure at least a million short of the reality. The Office for National Statistics has been exploring replacements based on \u2018administrative data\u2019, which could include NHS and tax and benefit records and the electoral roll. However, officials also want to use the vast databases run by private sector organisations to supplement publicly-held information. The ONS has canvassed the idea of tapping into information held by internet search engines such as Google and the databases of corporations such as Tesco and the energy supply giants. The results of the consultation will be made public later this month. Sir Andrew Green of the Migrationwatch UK think-tank warned that the proposals \u2018need to be examined very closely\u2019. \u2018There must be no question of burying the truth about the scale of immigration,\u2019 he said.

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- The long-anticipated Apple smartwatch became a reality this week when the tech giant unveiled its entry into the growing wearable-tech field. The Apple Watch, which comes in three styles and two sizes with multiple options for colors and wristbands, was expected to energize a market that's been slow to catch on as smartwatches from competitors such as Samsung, Sony, LG and Pebble rolled out over the past two years. More than just a tiny smartphone, the Apple Watch, which hits the market early next year, packs a ton of watch-specific features. It has a \"crown\" knob to control scrolling and zoom without having to touch the screen, silent pulse notifications, a slate of health and fitness apps and compatibility with Apple's new Apple Pay app, which lets users scan and pay card-free at participating stores. But there are also questions. The company is still mum on many of the device's specifications, including memory, screen resolution and -- most crucially -- battery life. The exact differences between the low-, middle- and high-end watches are also still blurry. The watch must be tethered to an iPhone -- some observers had hoped for a standalone device -- and its $350 price tag is more than many were expecting. So did the company do enough to make Apple Watch a breakthrough device that will shake up the gadget market the way its iPod, iPhone and iPad did? Many analysts said they think so. \"The Apple Watch defines the category in ways that other competitors will now have to work furiously to catch up to,\" said James McQuivey, a tech analyst at Forrester Research. \"In classic Apple style, the company has introduced a new interface -- the digital crown along with a tap and touch capable surface -- that will make Apple's watch experience significantly easier to use than anybody else's.\" While many competitors have released a single smartwatch, sometimes in designs that have been panned for being bulky and unfashionable, Apple's trademark attention to design could make a difference, said Carolina Milanesi,...",

The Pew Project on Excellence in Journalism took an in-depth look at how people use tablets to get news. When the study was conducted in July, Apple's iPad made up the vast majority of tablet computers in use in the U.S., although Pew researchers also looked at people who used similar devices, such as the Samsung Galaxy Tab, the Motorola Xoom and even the Nook Color. The project noted several differences between tablet users and the general U.S. population. First, tablet users tend to be more highly educated: Fifty-one percent have a college degree, compared with 28% of all Americans. Tablet users also tend to be richer: Fifth-three percent have an annual household income greater than $75,000, compared with 28% of the total U.S. population. (Conversely, 15% of tablet users have an annual household income of less than $30,000, while over a third of American households earn that much or less each year.) Most tablet users have jobs: Sixty-two percent are employed full time, compared with 41% of the total population. Along other demographic lines, tablets mostly mirror the general population in terms of gender, race and political ideology. But age indicates some differences: Nearly half (46%) of tablet users are age 30-49, while just 35% of Americans are in that age bracket. Also, only 7% of tablet owners are age 65 or older, while 17% of Americans are seniors. This part of the population is growing fast as baby boomers age. Tablet users do seem to be hungry for news. The project notes: \"About half (53%) get news on their tablet every day, and they read long articles as well as get headlines.\" Many news organizations are building and promoting their own apps specifically designed for tablets. The project found that about two-thirds of tablet users have a news app installed on their tablets, but that's not where they get most of their...",

It was almost a million dollar start for new hosts Equatorial Guinea -- almost but not quite. The squad had shared a seven-figure bonus after winning their first game of the tournament three years ago, but Congo Brazzaville put paid to any hopes of a windfall this time around. A late equalizer from Thievy Bifouma canceled out captain Emilio Nsue Lopez's opening goal for the hosts. Bifouma, who plays his club football in Spain with UD Almeria, put the ball through goalkeeper Felipe Ovono's legs in the 87th minute to earn Congo a share of the points. The Group A match was played in front of a sell-out crowd of 35,000 fans, which included Equatorial Guinea president Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. In the group's later game, Burkina Faso were defeated 2-0 by Gabon. The exciting curtain raiser was just the tonic for the 30th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which is being staged against a backdrop of off-field controversy. In November, Morocco pulled out as hosts citing fears about the spread of the Ebola epidemic. Many footballers, who are representing their countries at AFCON, are determined to put on a united show of solidarity in the fight against the deadly illness. The Confederation of African Football banned Morocco from the entering the prestigious event and turned to Equatorial Guinea. The tiny, oil rich nation in Central Africa co-hosted AFCON in 2012 with Gabon, which meant it had the facilities in place to handle its short notice call up.

I will leave it to them to defend the quality of their decisions.\" He declined further comment \"because the matter is now before the courts.\" A spokesman for the Immigration and Refugee Board earlier also had declined to comment on the grounds that refugee claims are confidential. However, a member of the board's Refugee Protection Division, William Davis, has written in The Toronto Star that the board found that Huntley's case demonstrated \"a picture of indifference and inability or unwillingness\" by South Africa to protect \"white South Africans from persecution by African South Africans.\" About 79 percent of South Africans are black; 9.6 percent are white. Huntley's attorney, Russell Kaplan, said his client had been attacked seven times by black South Africans who called him a \"settler\" and a \"white dog.\" \"In each instance, there were racially..."

Or in the case of HBO's hit series, \"True Blood,\" all bad things must meet the true death. After seven dark and twisted seasons of the drama, based on Charlaine Harris' \"Southern Vampire Mysteries,\" fans of the show -- referred to as \"Trubies\" -- must say their final goodbyes to Sookie (Anna Paquin), Bill (Stephen Moyer), Eric (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd) and the rest of the supernatural creatures of Bon Temps this Sunday. While some fans have argued the show's quality has declined over the years, it doesn't mean people have stopped watching. Here are the storylines we're absolutely dying to have wrapped up in the final episode: . Will there be a true cure to Hep-V? Hepatitis-V, a disease that infects both humans and vampires and is lethal to the latter, has been the main plot point of season seven. At first, the disease caused bloodsuckers to lose their minds and eat humans at an alarming rate. Midway through the season it began to transform and just weakened the vampires until eventually they withered away. Yes, Sarah Newlin's blood contains the cure to Hep-V, but only a select few actually know this -- and Mr. Gus of the Yakonomo Corporation (Will Yun Lee) wants to keep it that way. Instead of releasing the real cure to the world, he has teamed up with Eric and Pam (Kristin Bauer van Straten) to synthesize a partial antidote. That way, infected vampires will need to take the medicine regularly without ever being fully cured. Smart business move, but no doubt morally corrupt. Newlin (Anna Camp) has spent the last few episodes held captive, but will she finally escape in the series finale? Or will Eric and Pam turn on Gus and release the cure to the world? Could this maker-progeny duo actually make an ethical decision that doesn't also benefit them financially? Only time will tell. But as tensions rise between Gus and Eric, fans can definitely expect a showdown. Especially now that Sookie is in Gus' crosshairs. And everyone knows when it comes to Sookie, Eric does not...",

Iraqis mourn outside the Sadr City hospital Wednesday after several people were killed in clashes. Most of the casualties consist of civilians and \"criminal elements attacked by us,\" said Tahseen al-Sheikhly, a spokesman for the Baghdad security crackdown called Operation Enforcing the Law. Civilians are being caught in the crossfire because militants \"use the population to cover themselves,\" al-Sheikhly said. The number of Iraqi civilians killed and wounded nationwide continued to increase during April. According to Iraq's Interior Ministry, 969 civilians died and 1,750 were wounded during April. In March, the total was 923 civilians killed and 1,358 wounded -- a sharp increase over February, when 633 died and 701 were wounded. Despite Shiite militants' calls for the Iraqi government to honor a cease-fire, al-Sheikhly said, the crackdown on insurgents will end when the insurgency ends. \"I don't think there is a timetable for all this. I can't tell that this will end tomorrow or the day after,\" he said. The attacks \"will end when those aspects of violence end.\" He echoed sentiments expressed earlier in the day by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who said the government will not accept the existence of a nongovernment armed force.

A third major title of his fledgling career means the Northern Irishman is just a green jacket away from a career grand slam.

Indonesian soldiers provide security near a PT Freeport-owned gold mine in Timika, Papua province, on July 18. The state-run Antara News Agency had said that two people were reportedly killed when a 12-bus convoy carrying employees of PT Freeport was attacked by unidentified gunmen in the country's eastern-most province. The company clarified that a vehicle was wrecked in the province, killing one person and wounding several others. When police and mechanics drove to the area to assist, shots were fired at them. Three people were hurt in the shooting, the company said. \"No shots were fired at the PT-FI bus convoy as earlier reported,\" the company said.

            "(CNN) -- The Queen of the Blues is dead. Koko Taylor performs in Spain in 2005. Her last performance was in May of this year. Koko Taylor, a West Tennessee sharecropper's daughter who went to Chicago, Illinois, with \"35 cents and a box of Ritz Crackers\" at 24 and wound up an award-winning blues legend, died Wednesday at her Chicago home at 80. She died of complications from a May 19 surgery for gastrointestinal bleeding, her Web site reported. Just days before the surgery, Taylor won her 29th Blues Music Award, picking up the trophy for Traditional Female Blues Artist Of the Year. She performed her signature song, \"Wang Dang Doodle,\" at the ceremony. Known for her powerful vocals, Taylor was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1997, won the Blues Foundation Lifetime Achievement Ward in 1999 and was awarded a National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellowship in 2004. She also won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album in 1985 for her album \"Queen of the Blues.\" Taylor was born Cora Walton and picked up the nickname \"Koko\" because of her love of chocolate as a child. She also displayed a love of singing from an early age. She and her future husband, the late Robert \"Pops\" Taylor, traveled to Chicago in 1952, where Pops Taylor worked for a packing company while Koko Taylor cleaned houses. By night, the two roamed Chicago's blues clubs, where Koko Taylor sat in with top bands and was soon a popular guest artist. But it took 10 years for Koko Taylor to record on her own, after Willie Dixon got her signed to Chess Records and produced several singles, including \"Wang Dang Doodle.\" Taylor landed a permanent home with Alligator Records when Chess was sold in 1975. Her final performance was the May 7 blues award show, but earlier in the year she performed at the Kennedy Center Honors program honoring actor Morgan Freeman. Throughout her lengthy career, she shared the stage with nearly every blues performer imaginable, from Junior Wells and B.B. King to Taj Mahal and Muddy Waters. She was a..."

Five years ago, she was living in an orphanage in Lodwar, the largest city in northern Kenya, and she wanted a better education than her circumstances provided. \"I told them maybe if you take me to another school, maybe I can do better,\" Ikiru recalls. It was her request for a better school that sparked a direct change in the lives of the Johnsons, who are Georgia natives. It all began with Lee Johnson's first trip to Kenya as a volunteer. Eventually Carole joined him, and the pair spent time volunteering for the same orphanage where Ikiru lived.

        "Could you please generate a TLDR (Too Long Didn't Read) summary of the following news article?\n\nArticle: (CNN) -- A Mississippi judge Wednesday evening issued a temporary injunction forbidding the release of any more prisoners pardoned or given clemency by outgoing Gov. Haley Barbour, whose actions created an uproar. The pardons include four convicted murderers and a convicted armed robber who were released Sunday. The five now must contact prison officials on a daily basis as their fate is adjudicated. The pardons are \"a slap in the face to everyone in law enforcement and Gov. Barbour should be ashamed,\" said state Attorney General Jim Hood. The process of releasing 21 other inmates has been halted, said Hood, who sought the court order. A court hearing on the matter will be held January 23. Hood said Barbour violated Mississippi's Constitution because the pardon requests for many inmates were not published 30 days before they were granted, as required. \"He's tried to rule the state like Boss Hogg and he didn't think the law applied to him,\" Hood told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night, referring to a character in the 1980s TV series \"The Dukes of Hazzard.\" \"These families are afraid out here,\" Hood said of relatives of crime victims. Hinds County Circuit Court Judge Tomie Green issued the injunction, saying it appeared some pardons, including those for the four murderers, did not meet the 30-day requirement. Any inmates released in the future must meet the standard, Green ruled. On his way out the door, the Republican governor approved full pardons for nearly 200 people, including 14 convicted murderers, according to documents the Mississippi secretary of state's office released Tuesday. The four murderers who received full pardons last week -- David Gatlin, Joseph Ozment, Charles Hooker and Anthony McCray -- were cited in Green's order. They were all serving life sentences and worked as inmate trusties at the governor's mansion, said Suzanne Singletary, spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Trusties are inmates who can receive additional rights through good behavior. Hood told...",

The \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" and \"Bowling for Columbine\" director later expanded on his remarks, saying: \"But if you're on the roof of your home defending it from invaders who've come 7K miles, you are not a sniper, u are brave, u are a neighbor.\" Moore has long been a staunch advocate for stricter gun control laws in the U.S., and his statements are known to court controversy. His latest comments quickly prompted backlash. Former U.S. House speaker and CNN contributor Newt Gingrich invited Moore to spend some time with terrorist cells overseas, then weigh in on the value of snipers. The movie, starring Bradley Cooper and directed by Clint Eastwood, earned $105 million in weekend ticket sales and nabbed six Academy Award nominations last week, including best picture. The box office take trumped previous records for a January opening and is expected to grow on Monday as moviegoers enjoy another day off for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. Moore isn't the only one in Hollywood taking aim at the film: Actor Seth Rogen equated the war drama to a Nazi propaganda film shown in Quentin Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds.\" \"American Sniper\" is based on the best-selling memoir of the same name by Chris Kyle. Kyle served four tours in Iraq with the Navy SEALs and is lauded as \"America's deadliest sniper.\" He was not without controversy of his own, including disputed claims in his book that he punched former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura and killed two armed carjackers. Kyle was shot and killed by a former Marine in 2013.",

        "In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?\n\nArticle: Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration and many of its national security critics agree that it's time to revisit the war authorization that Congress approved a week after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. But when to end it and how to replace it is another matter. The House defeated an amendment by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, that would have \"sunsetted\" the so-called \"never-ending war\" a year from now. Attention now turns to the Senate and whether a proposal will emerge there. The law authorized a military response to the terrorist attacks by striking back against al Qaeda and associated forces, including their Taliban allies, who at the time ruled Afghanistan. Its scope is broad enough that it has been used by successive administrations to carry out military attacks as far afield as Africa and Yemen. When to end it is a prickly enough issue that the White House has done little to move ahead with President Barack Obama's promise, as described in a 2013 speech at the National Defense University, to work with Congress to \"refine and ultimately repeal\" the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF. As in other national security policy fights -- that of drones, for instance -- the rise of tea party-affiliated libertarians and Obama's sagging popularity have scrambled some of the traditional alliances on the war authorization. Liberals and right-leaning libertarians who criticize the war authorization as too much of a blank check to the President are uniting to support a repeal of it as a way to assert congressional authority. Some conservatives -- who not long ago supported extending the current AUMF -- now suggest replacing it with a law that specifies the groups the U.S. is fighting. \"I think we have abdicated our responsibility to define the nature of the conflict we're in,\" Schiff said in an interview. His amendment appeared to have gained steam, in part because the White House has struggled to make clear what it thinks should happen. At a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing...",

        "Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?\n\nArticle: Washington (CNN) -- Just hours after taking office, the new House of Representatives reinstated a team of ethics investigators that had faced what seemed like a certain death due to lawmakers' inaction. Overshadowed by the recent fiscal cliff hubbub, lawmakers from the last session had neglected to decide whether or not to renew the Office of Congressional Ethics. Last week, CNN reported on the concerns among public interests groups that lawmakers were purposely trying to kill the OCE through their inaction to avoid future ethics investigations. The House on Thursday night voted in new rules to reauthorize the OCE, and also added language that would allow members -- whose terms were set to expire -- to continue on the board. The OCE is considered to be one of the most important watchdogs in Washington. It's the only quasi-independent government body that's sole mandate is to formally investigate members of Congress. It was formed just four years ago when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others declared they wanted to \"drain the swamp\" of scandals and corruption in Washington. Among the biggest scandals that prompted action was that of Jack Abramoff, a former lobbyist, who admitted in 2006 to illegally showering gifts on officials in exchange for favors. The probe into those allegations led to convictions or guilty pleas for 20 lobbyists and public officials -- including a member of the House and several aides to congressmen. Other scandals included those tied to former Reps. Tom DeLay, Mark Foley, William Jefferson and Duke Cunningham. Since its creation in 2008, the OCE has launched more than 100 investigations of lawmakers, raising serious questions about possible congressional misdeeds. In about one third of its investigations, the OCE found that House ethics, and sometimes federal laws, were likely violated. Those 37 cases were referred to the House Ethics Committee for further review. House Speaker John Boehner and House Democratic leader Pelosi had previously said they would reauthorize the OCE and appoint...",

Still harboring a dream to excel at sports, the impoverished Guilhermina enrolled on a disability project being run by the Betim city council, focusing on swimming and running. \"I found an association that had sports for the vision-impaired. I joined and started to compete.\" She initially chose swimming because she didn't own a pair of running shoes, but her sister, who worked as a maid, said \"here, take mine.\" Guilhermina may have had a pair of hand-down trainers and a coach who encouraged her to compete in her first race, but her visual handicap left her at a further disadvantage. \"I had to train when no one was around because I had no guide,\" she said. So for fear of obstructing other runners, Guilhermina took to the track when it was deserted. \"I had to train at the hottest time, which was from 12-2 p.m. because...",

A glimpse of Africa's urban future or utopian fantasies? The jury might still be out, but these are the snapshots of urban life being touted by international property developers who are announcing plans for new satellite cities and vast modern compounds across Africa. They are usually planned to be built from scratch on the edges of the continent's existing metropolises, many of which are creaking under the weight of growing populations and rapid urbanization rates. From the Konza technopolis outside Nairobi, to King City near the emerging port of Takoradi, Ghana, through the luxurious Eko Atlantic on Victoria Island in Lagos, these urban projects are designed to offer high-quality services and modern infrastructure. They're typically branded as smart and futuristic, combining leisure facilities, business opportunities and social amenities for their residents -- from schools and medical centers to shopping malls, theaters and restaurants. Out of touch? Yet not everyone is convinced. Critics warn that many of these new developments will only serve a tiny elite, exacerbating an already deep divide between the haves and have-nots. \"They are essentially designed for people with money,\" says Vanessa Watson, professor of city planning at the University of Cape Town. She describes many of the plans as unsustainable \"urban fantasies\" that ignore the reality of African cities, where most people are still poor and live informally. \"What many of these new cities are doing will result in the exclusion and the forced removal of those kind of informal areas, which quite often are on well-located land,\" says Watson. In some cases, entire settlements have been relocated and large plots of land have been cleared to make way for the proposed...",

        "Summarise the article:\n\n(CNN) -- In what must be the most extraordinary statement of his presidency, Barack Obama on Monday blasted the possibility that the United States Supreme Court might overturn the Affordable Care Act. Obama said the court would take an \"unprecedented, extraordinary step\" if it overturns the law, because it was passed by \"a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress.\" Setting aside the point that the ACA did not pass with an overwhelming majority, but by a party-line vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, and without the support of a single member of the Republican Party, the most astonishing thing about Obama's diatribe was the fundamental misunderstanding of our constitutional tradition it revealed. Since 1788, in the famous defense of the Constitution set forth by Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, it has been understood that it is the task of the Supreme Court to rein in majoritarian legislatures when they go beyond what the Constitution permits. This is not, as Obama implies, judicial activism, or political activity on the part of the justices. This is simply, as Hamilton explained, fidelity to the Constitution itself, fidelity to the highest expression of \"We the People of the United States,\" the body whose representatives ratified that Constitution. That doctrine of judicial review was most famously expressed by the great Chief Justice John Marshall in Marbury v. Madison (1803), but it had been noted not only by Hamilton, but by many other federal judges in the late 18th century. And over the years, in more than 50 instances, courts have struck down unconstitutional behavior by the federal and state legislatures. Judicial review is not usurpation -- it is the manner in which the rule of law is preserved in this nation. It is certainly true that sometimes courts, and even the Supreme Court, have erred in their interpretation of the Constitution, and some legislative acts that clearly were permitted by the Constitution have been struck down. But if the ACA's individual...",

            "Three suspects were charged Tuesday for their alleged roles in a vicious mob beating of a Detroit tree trimmer after a car accident last week. Bruce Edward Wimbush Jr., 17, Wonzey Saffold, 30, and James Deontae Davis, 24, are three of the dozen or so people who attacked Steven Utash after he inadvertently struck a 10-year-old boy who had stepped into a road, Detroit Police Sgt. Michael Woody said. Utash, a 54-year-old grandfather, immediately stopped his vehicle to help the boy and was allegedly \"severely beaten\" with \"fists and feet,\" Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a news release. He's been in a medically induced coma since. Detroit Police Chief James Craig wouldn't go so far as to the attack a \"hate crime,\" but, he said, \"the issue of race is being looked at\" as a possible motive. He gave credit to a woman who stepped in as Utash was being attacked, CNN affiliate WDIV reported. \"Just her presence, offering aid to this gentleman, may have saved his life,\" Craig said. That woman, Deborah Hughes, met Utash's son to talk about what happened. \"I went to your dad and he was unconscious. He wasn't doing anything,\" she said, WDIV reported. \"I go over there and I say, 'Don't nobody else hit him. Don't put your hands on him. Leave him alone!' And everybody backed up and let me go to work on your dad,\" said Hughes, a retired nurse. She told WDIV that Utash gained consciousness at one point and asked, \"Is the boy dead?\" His son, Joe Utash, thanked Hughes for everything she did. \"I know that you saved him and that means so much to us,\" he said, WDIV reported. The prosecutor's office said the boy who was struck by Utash's truck was taken to a local hospital and treated for a leg injury. Woody said that he was unsure of the extent of the boy's injuries but that he is at home recovering from the accident. All three have been charged as adults with assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to do great bodily harm.  A fourth suspect, a 16-year-old boy, was also arrested, but prosecutors are still..."

            "(CNN) -- A teenage boy with a failing heart had been denied a chance at a heart transplant. But that decision was reversed this week, turning his family's frustration to joy. Anthony Stokes has been at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston since July 14, according to CNN affiliate WSB-TV. The hospital told his family the 15-year-old was ineligible for a spot on the heart transplant waiting list because of \"noncompliance,\" family friend Mark Bell told CNN. An August 7 letter from the hospital, which Bell provided to CNN, said that \"Anthony is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of noncompliance, which is one of our center's contraindications to listing for heart transplant.\" Noncompliance generally means that doctors doubt that a patient will take his medicine or go to follow-up appointments. In a statement Tuesday, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta said, \"While there has been misinformation circulating, Children's cannot discuss the specifics of this case or any other case due to privacy rules.\" The hospital earlier had said it was working \"closely with the family\" to find solutions. Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston is in good standing, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, the nonprofit organization in charge of transplant coordination in the United States. Assessing compliance for potential transplant recipients is important because if a patient doesn't strictly take all required medicines as directed, he or she could die within weeks of leaving the hospital, said Dr. Ryan Davies, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Delaware, who is not involved with this case. But Bell said a doctor told the family that Anthony's low grades and time spent in juvenile detention factored into that assessment. \"The doctor made the decision that he wasn't a good candidate because of that,\" Bell said. \"I guess he didn't think Anthony was going to be a productive citizen.\" Anthony's mother, Melencia Hamilton, told CNN..."

Often shunned by visitors, Jozi (as South Africans call Johannesburg) thrives on new ideas, outrageous talent and bold creativity. It's a city with an energy all of its own -- for that reason alone it's worth exploring. What to do: You can soak up the vibe at Maboneng Precinct, an inner-city neighborhood that's become a trendy gathering place for artists, foodies and performers. Food, accommodation and entertainment are all here. Another creative gathering space is 44 On Stanley. Once a collection of industrial buildings, it's been transformed into space that houses design studios, coffee shops and boutique stores. Where to stay: The Troyeville Hotel is as famous for the artists and political activists who've stayed here, as it is for the hearty Portuguese cuisine it's served them. Operating as a hotel since the 1930s, the Troyeville's intellectually inclined gatherings remain legendary for good food and conversation. 2. Cradle of Humankind . Experts say we all come from an area just hour outside of Johannesburg: the Cradle of Humankind. This UNESCO World Heritage Site has been inhabited by humans and our ancestors for more than 3 million years, providing an incredible look into our development as a species. What to do: The area is divided into two main sections. Maropeng has the official visitor center, built as a grassy dome. From here you can take an underground boat trip. The Sterkfontein Caves have exhibitions and trails into the caves. This is a fascinating area, with world-class interactive exhibitions, requiring a full day to take it all in.

The day also brought the death of a key figure in the allegations. Former News of the World reporter Sean Hoare, who told the New York Times in 2010 that former newspaper editor Andy Coulson encouraged him and other reporters to hack into the voice-mail accounts of public figures, was found dead, according to the British Press Association.

Britain is in an uproar over the scandal, which has cast its shadow not just across British journalism, but also Scotland Yard and the prime minister's office. It began with the phone-hacking allegations involving reporters from News of the World -- which led its parent company, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, to shut it down -- and quickly broadened into claims that journalists had paid police for confidential information. It has led to the resignations of the commissioner and assistant commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, known as Scotland Yard, forced the closure of one of the country's best-selling newspapers and resulted in 10 arrests.

Palin's top foreign policy adviser informed reporters of the meeting at a small briefing after Palin's visits with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. The adviser, Stephen Biegun, formerly a top member of the National Security Council under President Bush, characterized the intelligence briefing as \"routine\" and said it was the sort of meeting that \"is standard for candidates for the vice president and president.\" Biegun said several officials were present to brief Palin. Although Palin held photo-ops with the leaders, she refused to take questions from any reporters. The Alaska governor initially said that no reporters would be allowed to sit in on her meeting with Karzai. She planned to allow in only photographers and one television crew, but she changed her position after at least five U.S. news networks protested. CNN does not send cameras into candidate events where editorial presence is not allowed. Nonetheless, Biegun said, \"these are relationships that she intuitively understands are very important for the next president and vice president of the United States.\" In those get-togethers, Palin kept the focus primarily on energy issues and the growing influence of Russia, according to Biegun. Palin found Kissinger particularly engrossing; their meeting had been scheduled to last 30 minutes, but the two met for nearly an hour and a half. \"In talking to Dr. Kissinger,\" Biegun said, \"she...",

            "Centennial, Colorado (CNN) -- A shackled James Holmes, his hair still dyed red, heard prosecutors say Thursday he made threats at the University of Colorado a month before he allegedly opened fire at a Denver-area movie theater. Prosecutors, without stating the source of their information, also said Holmes, 24, failed to pass oral exams and chose to severe his relationship with the school, where he had been a Ph.D. candidate studying neuroscience. Holmes withdrew from the program in June, weeks before the shooting in Aurora. Prosecutors said the threats by Holmes were reported to campus police. Colorado shooting suspect's writings offer insight as student, aspiring scientist . The statements came as defense attorneys and prosecutors wrangled Thursday over access to records and documents. The main issue was whether the prosecution should receive non-medical documents from the university. These would include admissions forms, grades and transcripts. Victims and family members sat on one side of the courtroom. One woman was visibly shaking while another teary-eyed woman was comforted by a companion. Dark roots were visible in Holmes' hair; he now has a mustache and large muttonchop sideburns. While he appeared more lucid than his first appearance, Holmes still had a wide-eyed look. He did not speak at the hearing. Holmes is accused of opening fire July 20 during a midnight premiere of the latest Batman movie, leaving 12 dead and injuring 58 others. He has been charged with murder and attempted murder, and faces two weapons charges. The defense argued that the prosecution's request for records was too broad. Public defender Dan King called the request \"nothing more than a fishing expedition\" and said matters pertaining to his client's personal life were not relevant. King also asserted that the state likely has seen school documents. The judge did not issue an immediate ruling. Judge orders key records sealed, others released in theater rampage .

And they were joined by millions of Americans -- mothers and fathers; sisters and brothers -- who refused to accept these acts of violence as somehow inevitable.\" \"Over the past year, their voices have sustained us.

It's just another funk party in one of the lawless favelas on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Since 2008, when authorities launched a so-called \"pacification\" effort, police have stormed dozens of slums to squeeze out criminal gangs and make the city safer for residents as well as the hundreds of thousands of tourists expected for the World Cup, which starts next month, and the 2016 Olympic Games. Initially, police targeted shantytowns closest to tourist hot spots, the iconic favelas that cling to hills overlooking Copacabana and Ipanema. But far from the sunny beaches and pretty promenades that line the coast, drug gangs still reign supreme. Even during the day, the drug business is brisk and carried out in the open. Armed men, often just teenagers, stand watch at corners and communicate by radio as housewives, workers and children coming home from school walk by. Sales are made from a plastic table erected on a corner, piled with little baggies of marijuana, hashish, cocaine, crack, even an inhalant containing ether. Money is stuffed in plastic containers. The local dealers agree to talk while they carry on with their trade. \"What we sell most is the famous white powder, the 20-real hits,\" says Jorge as he holds up little baggies of cocaine, worth about $8. A hit of crack costs about $2 and a baggie of marijuana about $4. They say most of their customers are locals, but they increasingly have more clients coming from Rio's wealthier neighborhoods because of the heavier police presence there. Jorge, 22 with bleached hair, wears board shorts and flip-flops and has an AR-15 slung over his shoulder. \"I was born in the middle of trafficking. I didn't see any other alternative,\" he says. \"If I could choose a profession, I would be a fireman or a doctor.\" For decades, Rio's favelas were neglected by authorities, considered no-go..."

Thrashed by Australia for the second consecutive time in the five-match contest, England must now overcome 77 years of history to win the series. Not since 1936-37 has a team come from 2-0 down to win the Ashes -- on that occasion it was Australia which triumphed. What appears more likely is that England's horrific 5-0 whitewash defeat of 2006-7 will be replicated -- especially given Monday's 218-run defeat in Adelaide. \"It's certainly not impossible,\" England captain Cook told a press conference following the day's play. \"A lot of people who will be sitting in this room, and outside, will probably give us no chance. \"But if we don't believe that in our dressing room, if we believe the urn has gone, then it might as well have gone. \"Obviously 2-0 is not a great situation to be in. But if you look at a football game, the next goal can change it very quickly.\" England, which has won the past three Ashes series, has struggled from the outset against an Australia side which it defeated 3-0 only a few months ago. Only once before have England lost successive Tests by a margin of more than 200 runs, but following the 381-run loss in Brisbane, it now faces an almighty challenge to avoid humiliation. Many of England's problems have come in their batting line up which has failed to pass 400 in its past 20 Test matches. It now heads to Perth where it has only managed one win in 12 attempts and the scene of a 267-run defeat three years ago. One of the most frightening prospects for England is facing Australia's fast-bowler Mitchell Johnson, who has already taken 17 wickets in the first two matches. The extra pace and bounce in Perth will make Johnson even more dangerous -- an intimidating proposition considering the paceman took nine wickets at the WACA the last time these two met.

But they shouldn't be. The collapse of the Iraqi government's troops in Mosul and other northern cities in the face of Sunni militant resistance has been the predictable culmination of a long deterioration, brought on by the government's politicization of its security forces. The politicization of the Iraqi military . For more than five years, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his ministers have presided over the packing of the Iraqi military and police with Shiite loyalists -- in both the general officer ranks and the rank and file -- while sidelining many effective commanders who led Iraqi troops in the battlefield gains of 2007-2010, a period during which al Qaeda in Iraq (the forerunner of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) was brought to the brink of extinction. Al-Maliki's \"Shiafication\" of the Iraqi security forces has been less about the security of Iraq than the security of Baghdad and his regime. Even before the end of the U.S.-led \"surge\" in 2008, al-Maliki began a concerted effort to replace effective Sunni and Kurdish commanders and intelligence officers in the key mixed-sect areas of Baghdad, Diyala and Salaheddin provinces to ensure that Iraqi units focused on fighting Sunni insurgents while leaving loyal Shiite militias alone -- and to alleviate al-Maliki's irrational fears of a military coup against his government. In 2008, al-Maliki began replacing effective Kurdish commanders and soldiers in Mosul and Tal Afar with Shiite loyalists from Baghdad and the Prime Minister's Dawa Party, and even Shiite militia members from the south.

Often described as weak and unconvincing, it is continually bashed by criminal defense attorneys as being synonymous with reasonable doubt. It enjoys none of the glamour of its attractive twin sisters DNA and scientifically based forensic evidence, who even get their own TV shows. In truth, though, circumstantial evidence can sometimes be compelling and highly reliable. When combined with a touch of supporting direct evidence it can be the strongest of all cases as it does not rely on frequently unreliable eyewitnesses. As prosecutors often say in their summations, circumstantial evidence has no motive to lie and no problem with its eyesight. In a Massachusetts' courtroom, the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez in the death of Odin Lloyd may prove to be a textbook study of circumstantial evidence and its struggle to overcome reasonable doubt and celebrity status. Prosecutors are meticulously building a case using surveillance video and other evidence to link Hernandez to the killing. Surveillance video already publicly disclosed depicts a pre-homicide meeting between Hernandez and his friends Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, also charged in the case, at the  Hernandez home in North Attleboro. Hernandez is seen walking around with a gun and then departing with his two pals in what appears to be a Nissan Altima. Later video shows Hernandez, Ortiz and Wallace making a fuel stop where driver Hernandez purchases what will later prove to be a very important pack of bubble gum. Prosecutors assert that a trail of text messages and more  surveillance  video, this time from a vantage point across the street from Lloyd's apartment, show Lloyd entering the vehicle in response to a Hernandez invite. Later at a time consistent with the time necessary to travel from Lloyd's apartment, a vehicle is seen entering a remote industrial park approximately a mile from the Hernandez home.

Woods and Miclkelson fought out a classic duel at Doral in 2005 when Tiger set the tournament record of 24-under-par. With stiffer winds set for the weekend, that score is unlikely to be broken as Woods homes in on his second win on the PGA Tour this season, the other coming at Torrey Pines, another of his favorite layouts. Masters champion Bubba Watson and Swede Freddie Jacobsen, who shared the first round lead, were a further shot back. Struggling World No.1 Rory McIlroy has had to watch as his playing partner and fellow Nike stablemate Woods has made light work of the course over the first two days. The 23-year-old McIlroy will at least be around for the weekend in Florida, unlike at last week's Honda Classic where he trudged off midway through a dismal second round -- and later apologized. McIlroy showed signs of improvement in a second round three-under-par 69 for two-under 142, but finished with a dispiriting bogey five after three putting. It being a World Golf Championship event everyone in the select field gets to play all four rounds and the chance for the Northern Irishman to get his game into the groove as he builds up to the Masters.

        "Summarise the article:\n\n(CNN) -- One French tennis star kept alive his hopes of a long-awaited return to the ATP World Tour Finals on Tuesday, but another has missed out on a third successive appearance. Jo-Wilfried was the 2011 runner-up at the men's season-ending tournament, but he will not be part of the eight-man line-up in London next month after blowing two match-points against Kei Nishikori in the second round of the Paris Masters. Tsonga was ranked a career-high fifth last year, but has dropped to 10th in the standings after sitting out big chunks of this season due to injury. The 28-year-old raced to victory in the opening set against Nishikori but then lost two tie-breakers against the world No. 19 as he went down 1-6 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (9-7). \"I believe he managed well, because I could have won that match,\" Tsonga said of Nishikori, who beat France's Julien Benneteau in his opening match. \"He was very solid, especially during the important moments. \"I really have to improve my physical condition. I have to work a lot and very hard during the break. But if I'm able to play very solid matches like I played for the first set, it's going to be good.\" Tsonga led 6-5 in the decider but double-faulted, then Nishikori saved himself at 7-6 down with an ace. The first Japanese man to reach the fourth round of the French Open since 1938, he will next take on another player from the host country of this tournament -- Richard Gasquet -- on Thursday. With world No. 3 Andy Murray sidelined by injury for the rest of this year, ninth-ranked Gasquet holds the last place for London as he bids for his first qualification since his 2007 finals debut in Shanghai. He wasted two match-points in the second set against Fernando Verdasco on Tuesday but fought back to beat the Spaniard 7-5 6-7 (6-7) 6-3 in a match lasting two hours and 41 minutes. \"I felt bad,\" Gasquet said. \"I had two match points and I was close to winning the match.

        "Sum the following article in brief: Washington (CNN) -- In a classic \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch, Christopher Walken plays a music producer with just one message for his bands: \"More cowbell! I gotta have more cowbell!\" Sometimes you wonder if Walken is producing this year's election, too. In Mitt Romney, the GOP has nominated its least ideological candidate since Richard Nixon. At every turn, the party has demanded, \"More ideology! I gotta have more ideology!\" With the selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate, Romney has now acceded to that wish. The least ideological Republican candidate since 1968 has committed himself to the most ideological Republican program since 1964. Democrats must be stunned. The first battle in every election is the battle to decide what the election is about. What's the question voters must answer? Romney's choice of Ryan energizes two sides . In 1992, for example, Republicans wanted the election to be about George H.W. Bush's steady leadership in a dangerous world: the end of the Cold War and victory in the Persian Gulf. Democrats countered, \"It's the economy, stupid!\" This year, an incumbent even more embattled than George H.W. Bush has his own preferred election theme. He doesn't want to debate his own record, which is pretty dismal. He wants to debate the record of the congressional Republicans elected in 2010, a bunch radically less popular even than the president himself. You'd imagine that Romney's job was to refuse the Democratic invitation, to choose his own ground for the election, and to keep his distance from the congressional GOP. You'd imagine, but you'd be wrong. Romney has instead chosen to bolt himself to the House Republicans. He has chosen as his running mate Paul Ryan, the House Republican leader -- not their formal leader, but their intellectual leader, the person who set their agenda. He has effectively adopted Paul Ryan's agenda as his own: big immediate cuts in spending, a dramatic cut in the top rate of income tax to 28% and a bold reform of Medicare for those 55 and under.

Extensive DNA testing, performed at the Onondaga County medical examiner's office in Syracuse, verified the baby was Levon Wameling, who was 10 months old when his father reported the child was taken while unattended from the house porch, authorities said. The medical examiner, however, hasn't provided a cause of death, said Sgt. Steve Hauck, spokesman for Utica police. After receiving information, state police divers found the child in a container in the Mohawk River on September 6, authorities said. \"The Utica Police continue to investigate this case, with the hope that the truth will be learned and the person(s) responsible are held accountable,\" Hauck said in a statement. Earlier this month, the boy's father, Jevon Wameling, was arrested by New York State Police and accused of breaking into a home in a suburb of Utica to steal jewelry and money. Hauck said then he wouldn't say whether the father had anything to do with the tip leading police to the remains, citing the ongoing investigation, but the circumstances of Levon's disappearance raised questions about the boy's father from the start. Wameling took two weeks to go to an attorney's office and then call police to report Levon's disappearance, authorities said back in June. \"Based on the information that he's given us, we have a lot of concern,\" Utica Police Chief Mark Williams said at the time. \"We have a problem with what he says,\" Williams said. \"There's no question about it.\" The father told investigators he took the child out for a late-night walk and locked himself out of his home, so he put the boy down on the small front porch and went around back to find a way in. When he opened the front door, the baby was gone, the father told police. Levon would have turned a year old on August 31, police said. CNN's Chris Boyette contributed to this report.",

Goh made his initial court appearance Wednesday before Judge Sandra Bean in Oakland. Bean read the charges aloud in court and explained Goh's rights to him. Wearing a red jail jumpsuit, Goh uttered one word, \"yeah,\" when the judge asked him if One Goh is his name. Goh's next court appearance is April 30. At a news conference Wednesday, District Attorney Nancy E. O'Malley clarified that Goh voluntarily left Oikos last November and wasn't expelled as earlier reported. Oikos is a small college in Oakland that caters primarily to the Korean-American Christian community. Goh, 43, who is Korean-American, was upset because he \"wanted some money back for tuition he had paid, and it is also clear that he focused on one particular administrator at the school who was not present at the school on Monday,\" the day of the shooting, O'Malley told reporters.

The plot was discovered before it threatened any Americans, and no airliners were at risk, one U.S. counterterrorism official said. A nonmetallic explosive device like the one used in the failed attempt to bomb a Detroit-bound jet in 2009 was recovered, the official said, adding that it was meant for use by a suicide bomber. A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said authorities have \"no specific, credible information regarding an active terrorist plot against the U.S. at this time,\" although they continue to monitor efforts to carry out such attacks. President Barack Obama was told about the plot in April, and the attempt \"underscores the necessity of remaining vigilant against terrorism here and abroad,\" the White House said. The threat was foiled around the same time as the anniversary of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, although a second U.S. counterterrorism official said the attempted attack was not timed to coincide with the death of the al Qaeda leader. \"What this incident makes clear is that this country has to continue to remain vigilant against those that would seek to attack this country. And we will do everything necessary to keep America safe,\" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta soon after news of the plot broke. The FBI said it is conducting technical and forensic analysis on the improvised explosive device that was seized abroad. The device is similar to others previously used by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which Western officials describe as al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate, the FBI said. The device was meant to be put on a U.S.-bound airline, U.S. Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN's Anderson Cooper.

From novel portable chairs made out of shovels to chrome radiators that look like modern works of art, he recasts the mundane in a modernist and functional new light. The Nano Vent Skin forms an organic skin around a building providing its energy needs. Yet when he got thinking about how he could help with solutions to mitigate climate change he started thinking small. Very small, in fact. His futuristic concept is called the Nano Vent-Skin (NVS) and the design -- to wrap buildings in an organic lattice skin made up of micro wind turbines -- is radical. It's an intriguing idea and an exciting confluence of cutting edge science and industrial design. Back in 1959 American physicist Richard Feynman famously predicted that we'd be creating atom sized machines in the future. Today, advances in nanotechnology -- the science of impossibly small materials -- are rapid. Scientific discoveries at nanoscale -- one billionth of a meter -- are finding their way out of the lab and into production, creating more efficient computer chips and coatings for glass. It was all the big \"green\" projects around the world that got Otegui thinking about smaller solutions. Otegui told CNN: \"Instead of trying to build these huge turbines which are always getting bigger and bigger, I thought, why not do something on a small scale and use it on existing objects and buildings. I wanted to try to cover them like a crawling plants you see on facades.\" Armed with the desire to create something 100 percent organic, Otegui set about researching the possibilities. \"I found out about nanotubes and then I came across some MIT research into nano-manufacturing,\" he explained. Otegui imagines (see photos) merging living organisms to form a complex skin which will absorb and then utilize the energy created by the sun and wind.

Not to mention one of the planet's greatest collections of art -- at the Prado museum in Madrid. Then there's the food, which we've suggested is among the greatest cuisine in the world right now. What makes Spain such a cultural powerhouse? Size doesn't hurt. It's Western Europe's second-largest country (after France) in terms of area, and the world's third-largest exporter of wine, fruits and vegetables. But it's the incredible diversity of its people and passions that holds the key to understanding Spain's eternal appeal. More on CNN: \"Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown\" season two . 1. There are many Spains . During the grim decades of the fascist Francisco Franco's rule, regional languages such as Basque, Catalan and Galician were banned in Spain. On the dictator's death in 1975, a new, ultra-liberal constitution broke up Castilian centralism by handing over sweeping autonomy to the 17 regions. The result was a reinvigorated sense of regional pride that had a ripple effect on every form of culture. That's why street signs and menus sometimes come in unfamiliar dialects and languages such as Gallego (Galicia), which closely resembles Portuguese; Bable (Asturias); Catalan in Catalonia, the Balearics and Valencia; and Basque (possibly Europe's oldest language), which remains an unfathomable mystery of x's, k's and z's. 2. Bulls are a unifying force . Despite the diversity, Spain has at least one common thread: bulls. The bull is Spain's iconic animal, and you won't miss seeing at least one -- alive, dead or fake. They famously thunder through the streets of Pamplona each July and snort and kick round the bull rings of Madrid, Seville and countless smaller towns.

It is unclear when the second detainee was transferred to Belgium. Al-Mutairi's release follows a federal court ruling on July 29 as well as pressure from Kuwait's government, the group said. Al-Mutairi will be housed in a rehabilitation center in Kuwait, recently built by the government to provide the detainees with \"education, medical care, group discussions and physical exercise to help them recover from their long ordeal in Guantanamo,\" the Kuwaiti Family Committee said. The center was modeled after a similar program in Saudi Arabia. The recently released detainees join more than 550 from Guantanamo who have been transferred to 32 countries. More than 220 detainees remain at Guantanamo. The House of Representatives recently voted overwhelmingly not to allow detainees to be brought to the United States for trials or to be housed as prisoners. Attorney General Eric Holder has expressed frustration with congressional curbs on bringing the detainees to the United States, but said he thinks he can turn Congress around on the issue. \"I think we ultimately will be in a position to convince a majority of the members of Congress that that restriction should be removed,\" Holder said this month. Holder acknowledged the administration's efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay prison continue to run into delays, and that President Obama's January deadline for closing it will likely...",

        "Sum the following article in brief: GENEVA, Switzerland (Reuters)  -- Extreme sexual violence against women is pervasive in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and local authorities do little to stop it or prosecute those responsible, a U.N. investigator said on Monday. A woman struggles to describe her rape by military members. Health workers call rape an epidemic. Rape and brutality against women and girls are \"rampant and committed by non-state armed groups, the Armed Forces of the DRC, the National Congolese Police, and increasingly also by civilians\", said Turkish lawyer Yakin Erturk. \"Violence against women seems to be perceived by large sectors of society to be normal,\" she added in a report after an 11-day trip to the strife-torn country. Erturk, special rapporteur for the United Nations Human Rights Council on violence against women, said the situation in South Kivu province, where rebels from neighboring Rwanda operate, was the worst she had ever encountered. The atrocities perpetrated there by armed groups, some of whom seemed to have been involved in the 1994 Rwandan massacres in which 800,000 people were killed, \"are of an unimaginable brutality that goes far beyond rape,\" she said. \"Women are gang-raped, often in front of their families and communities. In numerous cases, male relatives are forced at gun point to rape their own daughters, mothers or sisters,\" she said. After rape, many women were shot or stabbed in the genital area, and survivors told Erturk that while held as slaves by the gangs they had been forced to eat excrement or the flesh of their murdered relatives. Women who have been raped are systematically rejected by their families and society. Widespread sexual abuse in the various conflicts racking the republic -- which last year held elections hailed as marking a new era -- \"seems to have become a generalized aspect of the overall oppression of women,\" Erturk said. Her report followed charges from U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour last week that soldiers and police used excessive force,...",

A portrait of Eluana Englaro. She was in a vegetative state for nearly 17 years. The speaker of the Italian Senate announced the death of Eluana Englaro, 37, Monday night, then called for a moment of silence in the chamber. Even as the silence ended, one legislator declared, \"She has not died -- she was killed,\" prompting other right-to-die opponents to join in with calls of \"Murderers!\" Englaro had been in a vegetative state for 17 years, after suffering what doctors determined to be irreversible brain damage in a 1992 car crash, when she was 20 years old. For years, Englaro's father, Beppino, fought to have her feeding tube removed, saying it would be a dignified end to his daughter's life. He said that before the crash his daughter visited a friend who was in a coma and told him she didn't want the same thing to happen to her if she were ever in the same state. Confirming his daughter's death Monday, Beppino Englaro told Italian media: \"Yes, she is no longer with us, but I don't want to say anything further. I need to be left alone.\" But the intense debate swirling around her case will go on.  Watch as Italians protest against her death \u00bb . When Englaro's death was announced, the Senate was debating a proposed law that would require doctors to provide nourishment to all incapacitated patients, and that would have forced doctors to resume feeding Englaro through tubes. Debate on that proposal as it would affect other patients is likely to continue in Parliament. Last year, a court ruled that the feeding tube could be removed, and Italy's high court upheld the ruling on appeal. Englaro was transferred last week to a private clinic, where the removal process began Friday -- even as the Senate took up a debate aimed at reversing that process. A decree aimed at preventing doctors from completely removing the...",

The new Cloud Player service adds a new \"Save to Amazon Cloud Drive\" button for saving MP3s to the cloud, as well as an option to upload music from a hard drive to a user's Cloud Drive. Users are given 5 GB of free storage, but can get 20 GB if they purchase an album through Amazon. It's $1 per GB after that. Cloud Player comes in two flavors, an app for the web and an Android app counterpart. Both players allow users to upload their music, create playlists and organize their music. And because it's a cloud-based platform, users can access their music and settings from any compatible computer or Android device. The most comparable service to Cloud Drive is probably Grooveshark, which also lets you upload your music, though Amazon has several major advantages in its MP3 store, its longstanding payment system and its stronger brand recognition. Google and Apple have been rumored to be hard at work on their own cloud-based players, but it looks like Amazon beat them to the punch. Amazon's Cloud Player will certainly face a stiff challenge when they launch their own streaming music services, especially given Google's control over Android and Apple's control over iPhone and iTunes. \u00a9 2010 MASHABLE.com.

The calm conditions that had allowed us to easily film inside the port quickly changed once we left the harbor, as we came up against 25-knot winds, rolling waves and spray soaking us from all sides. Having grown up on the northeast coast of England, this was the North Sea that I know and love. As we happily bounced around, we joked with the crew from Helix Energy Solutions' marine contracting business unit, Canyon Offshore, that we were -- despite having three cameras, a tripod, and two backpacks -- actually traveling light. About 2 miles (3 kilometers) out to sea, between the waves, we got fleeting glimpses of the MV Olympic Triton, the support vessel for remotely operated underwater vehicles. We could tell it was large, but as we drew closer to the 315-foot (96-meter) vessel it became clear it was not only large, but a serious piece of maritime engineering. Above its bow was a large helipad, and from the main deck a huge crane extended, with 9,800 feet (3,000 meters) of cable. As we approached the Olympic Triton, conditions were too dangerous for us to board and we had to wait for the massive vessel to turn to give us a bit of shelter. While waiting we filmed our first key sequence: the ROV being lowered into the water. Sequence recorded, next came the challenge of boarding. The tools used in the search . Sheltered from the worst of the weather we were still rising and falling in the water by as much as 10 feet -- which, in Tony's words, was making things a little \"lively.\" To board, we had to wait for the bow of our boat to rise up and then throw ourselves at a small wood and rope ladder and hanging grab rope and pull ourselves aboard. Only sitting at the airport at the end of the day did we admit to each other that we could replace the word \"lively\" with \"terrifying.\" Safely...",

Van der Sloot faces up to five years in prison if convicted on the lesser charge and a minimum of 15 years if found guilty of first-degree murder. Altez gave a copy of the motion, dated late last year, to \"In Session.\" A judge has not yet made a ruling on it, he said. Van der Sloot has been charged with first-degree murder and robbery in the case of 21-year-old Stephany Flores. Authorities found Flores' body in a Lima hotel room registered to him in June last year. He is perhaps best-known as the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of an American teenager in Aruba. Van de Sloot was arrested twice in connection with the Natalee Holloway case, but was not charged. Police have said Van der Sloot admitted that he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case. After killing Flores, police say, Van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested June 3. He was returned the next day to Peru. \"My client ... admits having murdered the victim, but not with ferocity, for profit or pleasure, nor any of the other element(s) that make up this murder, but only by violent emotion that overtook him at the time he was attacked by the victim,\" Altez's motion read. The lawyer contends there is no evidence of robbery. Van der Sloot also faces federal wire fraud and extortion charges in the United States, where prosecutors say he demanded more...",

Georgian troops take part in military exercises in January. They are to participate in NATO maneuvers this week. About 500 troops at a military base outside the capital, Tbilisi, were involved in the rebellion, said Interior Ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili. He said it was quickly brought under control, and the government reported a few hours later that the base was calm. Initial investigations suggest that Russia, Georgia's northern neighbor and former ruler, may have had a hand in the mutiny, Utiashvili said. Russia denied involvement in the incident. \"Tbilisi has pulled yet another anti-Russian prank. ... This is not the first time we are so vocally blamed for interfering. It is typical that each time the charges become more ridiculous,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Utiashvili claimed that Georgia had secret recordings of the mutineers saying they had \"full Russian support.\" \"We know Russia is against the planned NATO exercises in Georgia. We know they have increased the troops at the border. We don't have 100 percent evidence right now, because the investigation is ongoing,\" he said. But, he added, until the investigation is complete, officials won't point a finger at Russia. On Tuesday afternoon, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili called on Russia to stop \"provocative maneuvers\" in Georgia, according to Georgia's English-language Prime News. Russia and Georgia fought a five-day war in August over the breakaway Georgian province of South Ossetia, the first time Russia sent troops abroad in anger since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. NATO is expected to launch month-long military exercises this week in Georgia.

World No.1 Djokovic needed four hours 43 minutes, the longest men's singles semifinal in the tournament's history, to beat Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro, 7-5 4-6 7-6 6-7 6-3. Home favorite and second seed Murray won a gripping, but at times controversial, last four clash with Poland's Jerzy Janowicz, 6-7 6-4 6-4 6-3 to join him in the title match. It will be their fourth clash in a grand slam final, the last won by Djokovic in the Australian Open earlier this year. The top seed was involved in the match of the tournament, marked by breathtaking and grueling rallies, none more so than when Djokovic had the first of his chances to win as he led 6-4 in the fourth set tiebreak, holding two match points. An incredible 24-shot exchange ended with Djokovic hitting long and former U.S. Open champion del Potro took advantage to win the next three points, including the second match point, to force the decider. The pace was unrelenting and Del Potro finally cracked in the eighth game, conceding his service to leave 2011 champion Djokovic to serve for his place in the final. Del Potro was still not finished and forced a break point, but Djokovic was not to be denied and closed out victory on his third match point with a backhand winner. \"It was one of the best matches I have been part of, one of the most exciting, it was so close,\" he told BBC Sport. \"That's why he's a grand slam champion, he came up with some unbelievable shots . \"I'm very proud to go through.

Mohamud was whisked away by the FBI and Portland Police Bureau after he attempted to detonate what he believed was an explosives-laden van parked near the tree-lighting ceremony in Portland's Pioneer Courthouse Square, the Justice Department said in a written statement. But the bomb turned out to be fake, thanks to an undercover operation designed to undermine the plotter. Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said \"the materials were not explosive,\" and officials said the public was never in danger from the mock device. A resident of Corvallis, Oregon, and a student at Oregon State University, Mohamud -- who now faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $250,000 fine -- was arrested on suspicion of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, the FBI said.

        "Summarise the article:\n\n(CNN) -- Financial markets were in turmoil on Wednesday amid fears that more countries could be sucked into Greece's mounting debt crisis. European indexes followed those in Asia into the red after Standard & Poor downgraded Greece's debt rating to junk status and Portugal's rating also dropped two notches. So what has prompted the crisis and what could happen next? How did Greece get into this trouble? Years of unrestrained spending, cheap lending and failure to implement financial reforms left Greece badly exposed when the global economic downturn struck. This revealed partly fiddled statistics that showed debt levels and deficits exceeded limits set by the European Central Bank. How big are these debts? National debt, put at \u20ac300 billion ($394 billion), is bigger than the country's economy, with some estimates predicting it will reach 120 percent of gross domestic product in 2010. The country's deficit -- how much more it spends than it takes in -- is 12.7 percent. Greece crisis deepens on global market sell-off . What does the credit rating downgrade mean? The credit rating is an assessment of a country's ability to repay its debts, and Tuesday's downgrade to junk status, the lowest in the eurozone, means Greece is viewed as a financial black hole by foreign investors. Institutions such as pension funds can no longer buy Greek bonds and it leaves the country struggling to pay its bills as interest rates on existing debts rise. The Greek government of Prime Minister George Papandreou, which inherited much of the financial burden when it took office late last year, has already scrapped most of its pre-election promises and must implement harsh and unpopular spending cuts. And any bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is likely to mean more austerity measures must be introduced. How does this affect the rest of the world? Greece is already in major breach of eurozone rules on deficit management and with S&P downgrading the country's debt rating to junk status, this reflects badly on the...",

Fossils including dinosaur skeletons are on display at the I.M. Chait Gallery on Saturday. Auctioneers at the I.M. Chait Gallery had hoped the 150-million-year-old, 9-foot-long dryosaurus would sell for as much as $500,000, but the bidding did not add up. Two museums are said to still be interested in acquiring the skeleton, being sold by Western Paleontological Laboratories out of Utah. An 18,000-year-old, 7-foot-tall and 15-foot-long skeleton of a teenage woolly mammoth from Siberia took the auction's top price, fetching close to $60,000. A completely opalized green, blue, yellow and red ammonite fossil measuring 2\u00bd feet in diameter went for close to $50,000.

George Rekers resigned from the board of the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality, the group's website said Tuesday. \"I am immediately resigning my membership in NARTH to allow myself the time necessary to fight the false media reports that have been made against me,\" Rekers said in a statement posted on the group's website. \"With the assistance of a defamation attorney, I will fight these false reports because I have not engaged in any homosexual behavior whatsoever. \"I am not gay and never have been,\" the statement said. The association accepted the resignation, saying on its website Tuesday that it \"would hope that the legal process will sufficiently clarify the questions that have arisen in this unfortunate situation.\" The group has scrubbed Rekers' writings from its site, with a page that formerly featured his work now bearing the message, \"Sorry, you've reached a page that doesn't exist.\" Rekers, a Baptist minister, has been a prominent and effective foe of gay rights legislation across the country.

The General Services Administration plans to convert a warehouse in McAllen, Texas, into a processing center for the minors, according to a city building permit. The U.S. Border Patrol will run the 55,702-square-foot building about 3 miles from the Mexican border that will temporarily hold up to 1,000 children. It would seem like a drop in the bucket. About 400 children cross into Texas per day, said Rep. Henry Cuellar. The Texas Democrat represents the district where most of them enter. Many are seeking more opportunity or want to reunite with family. But violence in their home countries -- particularly Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala -- is is helping create an acute tide of child migrants. U.S. authorities estimate 60,000 to 80,000 children from Central America will arrive this year in the United States without a parent or guardian. Some of them are infants. \"This is a humanitarian crisis,\" said Cuellar. The government has no idea yet how it will feed, house and diaper the children. Partisan fights . Political friction erupted over the inrush of unaccompanied minors after images appeared this spring showing some of them packed into detention centers in Arizona.

Jackie Nikelia Thorpe's body was found along Seven Bridges Road in August 2007. Since May 2005, the remains of five women have been found near Seven Bridges Road outside Rocky Mount, North Carolina. The road snakes northeast out of town into rural Edgecombe County. Rocky Mount Police Chief John Manley Jr. thinks the women's deaths are related. \"They seem to have some connection,\" he said. Lanessa Williams of Rocky Mount thinks she narrowly missed joining the ranks of the slain women, saying she is not sure whether a man who offered her a ride to a friend's house last year is responsible for their deaths. The longer the two drove, the more she felt a sense of danger, said Williams, 38. The man -- whom she described as thin and African-American, with a mustache and glasses -- rarely spoke and \"looked crazy.\" \"He kept on going, and he rode through lights, and he wouldn't let me get out,\" she said. Eventually, her fears were confirmed when he demanded sex. \"He told me that if I didn't do what he wanted me to do, he was going to kill me and throw me in the river.\" The man eventually stopped his truck in a dark wilderness area, she said. When he got out, she ran away. \"I laid in a ditch and stayed there for a while,\" she said. \"He was riding around looking for me.\" Police are talking to Williams about her experience. She told authorities she noticed something strange: The large block letters saying \"Chevrolet\" on the back of the man's truck appeared to be painted on.

Ordeal: Vikki Webb lost her father in May 2011. His lung cancer was only discovered when pain in his hips became so severe he paid for a private scan . The postcode lottery is killing 6,000 cancer patients prematurely each year, it was claimed yesterday. Around 6,000 more could live for at least 12 months after a cancer diagnosis every year if the average survival rate for England matched the top 10 per cent of local healthcare areas. Figures show the proportion dying within a year of a cancer diagnosis is two-thirds higher in the worst-performing areas of the country than the best. Almost four in ten cancer patients in Barking and Dagenham, Essex, die within just 12 months, compared with one in four in North East Hampshire, says the charity Macmillan Cancer Support. It has published estimates of variations in cancer care drawn from official data on cancer survival rates for 2011-2013. The assessment follows warnings by MPs of a postcode lottery meaning that in some areas, five times as many patients are waiting more than two weeks to see a specialist. A recent study of 35 countries by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found only Poland has worse survival rates than Britain for breast, bowel and cervical cancers. The latest analysis showed the number of people dying within a year of being diagnosed was almost 60 per cent higher in Barking and Dagenham than North East Hampshire \u2013 where only 24 per cent of cancer patients do not survive for 12 months. In Barking and Dagenham, 38 per cent of people diagnosed die within a year, a figure matched by Crawley, West Sussex; Newham, London; Swale, Kent; Vale Royal, Cheshire and Thanet, Kent.

            "Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- The only man recognized as a survivor of both atom bombs dropped in Japan at the end of World War II has died. Tsutomu Yamaguchi died Monday after a battle with stomach cancer. He was 93. He had long been a certified \"hibakusha,\" or radiation survivor, of the August 9, 1945, atomic bombing in Nagasaki. In March 2009, the Japanese government confirmed that he had also survived Hiroshima three days earlier. On that day, the U.S. B-29 bomber Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb nicknamed \"Little Boy,\" which exploded over Hiroshima at 8:15 in the morning. Yamaguchi happened to be in the city on a business trip for his employer, Mitsubishi Shipyard. Many years later, he recalled the bombing in a story that appeared in the British newspaper The Times. \"It was very clear, a really fine day, nothing unusual about it at all. I was in good spirits,\" he said. \"As I was walking along, I heard the sound of a plane, just one. I looked up into they sky and saw the B-29, and it dropped two parachutes. I was looking up into the sky at them, and suddenly ... it was like a flash of magnesium, a great flash in the sky, and I was blown over.\" Badly burned, Yamaguchi returned home to Nagasaki only to experience horror again. \"My double radiation exposure is now an official government record,\" Yamaguchi told reporters last year after his official recognition. \"It can tell the younger generation the horrifying history of the atomic bombings even after I die.\" About 140,000 people perished in Hiroshima and an additional 70,000 in Nagasaki. Many of those who survived suffered a lifetime of radiation-related health problems, including cancers. Yamaguchi lost his hearing in his left ear in the blasts, and suffered from acute leukemia, cataracts and other bomb-related illnesses in subsequent years.

Chris Christie called a fire raging through boardwalk buildings Thursday an \"unthinkable situation\" as firefighters continued to fight the high flames and black smoke in Seaside Park, New Jersey. Christie said 35 engine companies, 15 ladders and 400 firefighters remained on the scene Thursday evening. So far, dozens of businesses have been burned and damaged over four blocks. Some embers hit a condominium, but it was quickly put out, Christie said. Several firefighters have sustained minor injuries, including heat exhaustion and smoke inhalation, Christie said. The fire was still burning along Ocean Terrace Avenue between Stockton Avenue and Lincoln Avenue Thursday evening. Christie said he was notified of the fire shortly after 3:30 p.m. ET. A cause has not been determined. The damage is almost entirely on the boardwalk, Christie said. Fire personnel dug a 20-foot trench on Lincoln Avenue; \"that's where firefighters are making their stand right now,\" Christie said. Brisk winds are spreading the fire, Christie said. \"The destruction south of Lincoln Avenue, it's complete,\" Christie said Thursday. \"I said to my staff, I feel like I want to throw up, and that's me.

Now retired, the 30-year law enforcement veteran reveals trade secrets about how he \"made friends\" with criminals and coaxed them to confess. For example, take Paul Eugene Rowles -- a convicted murderer and sexual predator who died last year in a Florida prison. When he was with Metro-Dade Police in 1972, Frank arrested Rowles for the strangling death of Rowles' Miami neighbor, Linda Fida. Frank, who spoke with CNN by phone, described the handsome, 6-foot, blue-eyed Rowles as \"someone you trust right away, very pleasant to talk to, soft spoken, somebody you wouldn't think would be a dangerous killer. But these killers are the most dangerous of all.\" For them, Frank said, killing is \"like an addiction, like heroin, and they've gotta have that murder fix.\" So, how did Frank get Rowles to confess? \"I made friends with him,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"It took half an hour.\" But he didn't do it alone. \"I had another cop in the room with me, and we knew each other's methods. The other detective just stayed quiet. He was there for support, but not to be a part of the interrogation.\" Sitting close to Rowles with his knees almost touching him, Frank said he would lean toward him during the interrogation. \"I was really appearing to be interested in him,\" Frank said. Then they started talking about how Rowles' life, family, father and mother had all affected him and \"how that led to what he had just done.\" And then Rowles began \"blathering the confession out,\" Frank said. \"He started crying.\" Although Rowles was sentenced to life in prison, he was paroled in 1985. Nine years later Rowles was convicted of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a minor and sentenced to 19 years. In 2012, DNA testing linked Rowles to the 1992 murder of 21-year-old Elizabeth Foster.

Demonstrators in the town of Sohar have blocked routes to the port and the industrial zone, prompting port staff to leave work, two sources in the town said. Protesters demands include greater freedom of expression, higher salaries, a clampdown on government corruption, a new constitution, and the prosecution of security officials whose actions led to the death of demonstrators. It's the third day of demonstrations in Oman's second city, a key port. Oman is not a major oil producer, but a significant share of the world's oil shipping passes through the Strait of Hormuz, along the Omani coast. Oil prices did not appear to be spiking on Monday's Omani unrest. Witnesses did not report any clashes between security and the protesters, saying the two sides were keeping apart. There were reports of attacks on property over the weekend, but on Monday the protesters organized committees to protect buildings and handle traffic, CNN's sources said. Fifteen young protesters submitted their demands in writing to officials Monday, with promises that the demands would passed to the sultan. There have been calls for demonstrations in the capital Muscat on Tuesday. Sultan Qaboos bin Said ordered the hiring of 50,000 citizens in the aftermath of weekend protests that left at least one person dead and 11 others injured, state-run media reported Sunday. The ruler also issued royal orders saying job-seekers who register with the Ministry of Manpower will be paid 150 rials (about U.S. $390) per month until they find jobs, according to the Oman News Agency. After reports of multiple deaths on Sunday, Ahmed Al Saidi, the minister of health, said there had only been one death. The protests started Saturday and were ongoing Monday, said Zamzam al Rashdi, editor-in-chief of the state-run Oman News Agency. A supermarket was...",

        "In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?\n\nArticle: Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Eight current and former Bell, California, city officials arrested and charged Tuesday with misappropriation of funds and making or receiving illegal loans demonstrated \"corruption on steroids,\" the Los Angeles County district attorney said. The charges allege the officials misappropriated more than $5.5 million, including being paid for phantom meetings, District Attorney Steve Cooley said at a news conference. High salaries paid to officials of the city sparked local outrage and national attention when they came to light in July. Bell City Manager Robert Rizzo, Police Chief Randy Adams and Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia resigned after media reports that they were making several hundred thousand dollars a year each. Adams was not charged, Cooley said. \"The complaint alleges they used the tax dollars collected from the hard-working citizens of Bell as their own piggy bank, which they looted at will,\" Cooley said at the news conference. Arraignment is scheduled for Wednesday. In addition to Rizzo and Spaccia, those arrested were Mayor Oscar Hernandez, Vice Mayor Teresa Jacobo, council members George Mirabal and Luis Artiga; and former council members George Cole and Victor Bello. Bail ranged from $3.2 million for Rizzo to $130,000 for Cole. A battering ram was used to secure the arrest of Hernandez, Cooley said. Rizzo, who was being paid nearly $800,000 annually, is charged with 53 counts of misappropriation of public funds and conflict of interest. Among the allegations are that he wrote his own employment contracts and that they were never approved by the City Council, prosecutors said. Cooley alleges that Rizzo, hired as Bell's chief administrative officer in September 1994, gave nearly $1.9 million in unauthorized loans to himself, Spaccia, Artiga, Hernandez and dozens of others. Rizzo is responsible for $4.3 million of the city's losses, Cooley said. Rizzo's attorney, Jim Spertus, said Cooley ensured that reporters witnessed the arrest of his client and called it...",

The successful applicant will have plenty of time to explore the Great Barrier Reef. However, it is true and a very clever marketing ploy to boot. Australia's Tourism Queensland has garnered worldwide media coverage by advertising the \"best job in the world\" -- the post of caretaker on Hamilton island in the Great Barrier Reef. The six-month contract, according to Tourism Queensland, comes with flexible working hours and the successful applicant's \"key responsibilities\" include exploring the area to discover what is on offer and to report back weekly via blogs, photo diaries, video updates and media interviews. Sounds taxing doesn't it? The group said other responsibilities would include cleaning the pool, which comes with your free home, feeding the fish and collecting the mail (this would be done by joining the aerial postal service for a day or two to get a good view of the neighboring islands). You might also take time out from your busy schedule to check out the turtles and passing whales. On top of the six-figure salary you'll get return airfares from your nearest capital city, transport on the island, travel insurance, computer and camera gear and travel to other islands in the Great Barrier Reef. No academic qualifications are required but you must be a good swimmer and enjoy snorkeling, be adventurous and have good communication skills. Where do I sign up I hear you ask? Tourism Queensland is asking for a 60-second video explanation of why you'd be great for the job and that you fill out their online application form at www.islandreefjob.com .

The Kings lead the series 3 to 1 and game 5 with be played Saturday in New Jersey. If the Kings win Saturday, the series would end in New Jersey to the chagrin of some. \"I want them to win the Cup in six games so we can see them win here in Staples Center,\" said Joey Giffee, as he held his ticket for the sixth game in Los Angeles. A record crowd of 18,867 fans were at a fever pitch Wednesday night, but the Devils hushed the crowd with three third period goals. \"I wanted to see blood and guts and L.A. take them down,\"said Ann Marie Love, standing outside the arena. For most of the game, the Devils and the Kings remained in a tight scoreless battle. New Jersey goaltender Martin Brodeur and Los Angeles goalie Jonathan Quick seemingly put up walls in front of their nets in a defensive struggle. Among the celebrities in attendance were longtime Kings fans Matthew Perry and Alyssa Milano, along with Will Ferrell, who made a raucous video cheering the Kings that went viral throughout now-hockey-crazy Los Angeles. Kings fans, most dressed in their home team's black, roared throughout the contest and chanted \"MVP\" each time Quick stopped a serious scoring chance by the Devils. From the start, the Los Angeles Kings seemed doomed to be underdogs. They are a hockey team in a land without snow or even ice. They couldn't even find a puck for their first practice in 1967. Not even the Great One, Wayne Gretzky, could bring the team a Stanley Cup. And to marginalize them further, the Kings had to compete for fans against other local teams, some legendary: the Lakers, the Dodgers, the Angels and the Clippers. But the Kings are positioned to win their first Stanley Cup in the franchise's 44-year history. The..."

        "Sum the following article in brief: Google is knocking at your front door. It wants to come inside, make itself at home, and quietly turn all of your boring home devices into \"smart\" connected gadgets that learn about your patterns and preferences, talk to each other, collect data about your habits and make life easier by assisting with daily tasks. On Monday, Google announced it was buying smart-device company Nest Labs for $3.2 billion in cash. This is Google's first major foray into connected homes, and news of the deal ignited a flurry of speculation about what the Silicon Valley giant really wants from Nest, as well as some privacy concerns. Nest currently only sells two products: a smart thermostat that learns your habits over time and adjusts the temperature accordingly, and a personable smoke and carbon monoxide detector that doesn't panic when you burn toast. While the devices have been popular, on the surface they don't seem like they move enough units to be worth such a hefty investment, even at $130 to $250 each. It's what's behind the scenes and inside the gadgets that makes Nest a coveted get for Google. Nest makes impeccably designed hardware powered by clever algorithms. Its staff comes from major companies like Apple, Sling and Logitech and is experienced in machine learning, product design, artificial intelligence and robotics. Nest is a standout in the increasingly crowded connected-home market. It may only have two products, but those devices are considered some of the best in the field. For now, Nest is expected to continue operating as its own brand headed by co-founders Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers, but down the line Google could tap the team's expertise to help with its own hit-and-miss attempts at creating and selling devices (remember the Nexus Q?). The Nest thermostat uses motion, light, temperature and humidity sensors to collect information about what's going on in the home and uses that information to control heating and cooling and predict patterns. The end result is a customized, more energy efficient home. Like...",

            "(CNN) -- Linguists announced Monday they have identified an endangered language known as Koro that is spoken by about 800 people in northeast India. The language was unknown to science and recently came to light during an expedition by linguists traveling in India on fellowships for National Geographic, the linguists said in telephone interviews. Koro belongs to the Tibeto-Burman language family, which is composed of a group of about 400 languages spoken primarily in east, central, south and southeast Asia and includes Tibetan and Burmese, according to linguist K. David Harrison. Some 150 Tibeto-Burman languages are spoken in India alone, but no other language has been identified as closely related, said Harrison, an associate professor of linguistics at Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania. Like most languages, Koro is unwritten and transmitted orally. It is neither a dialect nor a sister language close to Hruso-Aka, despite being considered such by both Hruso and Koro people. Koro shares some vocabulary with other languages spoken in the region but shares more features with languages spoken farther east, such as Milang and Tani, the linguists said in a news release issued by National Geographic. Harrison and another National Geographic Fellow, Greg Anderson, led the expedition, called Enduring Voices, which brought Koro to light. Enduring Voices documents vanishing languages and cultures and assists with language revitalization. Harrison and Anderson, director of the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages, in Salem, Oregon, focused on Arunachal Pradesh, a remote area of northeast India that is considered the black hole of the linguistic world. It is a language hotspot where there is room to study rich, diverse languages, many unwritten or documented. A permit is required to visit, few linguists have worked there and a reliable list of languages has never been drawn up. \"On a scientist's tally sheet, Koro adds just one entry to the list of 6,909 languages worldwide.

Hall of the International Security Assistance Force announced that fast-food offerings like Pizza Hut, Dairy Queen and Orange Julius were being shuttered in Afghanistan, he was blunt about it. \"This is a warzone, not an amusement park,\" he wrote on the ISAF blog. These mobile restaurants and others that can be found on large bases in Kandahar and Bagram, are \"nonessentials\" and are being shut down to streamline delivery of much-needed battlefield supplies. However, according to some soldiers and Marines -- all of whom have served in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan -- access to the familiar hometown mall fare isn't as important to morale as many civilians may have thought. The veterans and active-duty troops all said that access to healthy foods, local cuisine and packages of snacks sent by friends and family trumped military base fast food as morale boosters. The announcement of the fast-food outposts' shuttering inspired a lively debate on CNN's Afghanistan blog about morale and the amenities afforded servicemen and women serving overseas -- often in harm's way. Those affected, however, didn't seem very concerned. \"The big things that improve morale in a combat zone are lots of letters and packages from loved ones,\" Marine Cpl. David Brian Crouch said. Especially appreciated in these care packages are sweet, sour, salty and spicy condiments, such as Tabasco, sugar packets and seasoned salts for enlivening the military's frequently derided Meals Ready to Eat -- individually packaged rations for service members stationed away from meal preparation facilities. These high-calorie MREs, which have long drawn criticism for depressingly bland flavors and textures, are precisely what Crouch, who served two tours in Iraq, says drove his fellow troops to seek out more flavorful, familiar fast food. Others look a little closer to their temporary home, sampling the local fare. While many soldiers out on combat patrols were, according to Army Capt. David Swaintek, \"too tired and...",

It's not that I don't like all of the above, I simply dislike the commercialization of love. But whether you're shy or not about proclaiming your love, the reality is that this day is big business. Lufthansa Cargo is one of the many carriers that help to deliver romance. Every year it transports 20,000 tons of flowers and plants. In the days leading up to Valentine's Day, it will fly one thousand tons of roses. Ensuring they reach their final destination in full bloom is a complex logistical chain that begins with the growers. The roses come directly from Kenya, Colombia and Ecuador. They are picked up locally by the freighter and while they vary in shape and quality, they all have to meet tough quality standards and strict European Union regulations. This begins the moment they board the plane. Here, the captain has to shower them with love, attention and a temperature in the range of four and eight degrees. Lufthansa's cargo pilot, Robert Nilles, tells me this is important \"because roses are easily perishable goods, it's very important not to disrupt the code chain.\" After a 10 hour flight, they land at Frankfurt and here, it's all about speed and punctuality. With cargo doors open and temperatures below zero, the roses need to be moved quickly. In less than an hour, all 65 tons of roses are moved from the freighter to the perishable center where their temperature is taken once again. Hans-Jurgen Hess is responsible for the next step. As a representative of the German government, it's his responsibility to check all food and plant shipments that come through Frankfurt. But his task is bigger than this: He's a border inspector for the whole of the EU and he must make sure that everything that leaves Frankfurt is clean of any diseases. Picking up a pink bunch of roses, Hess shows me he'll be looking at leaves and stems for plant rust, mildew, whitefly and many more bugs. He'll...",

John F. Kennedy draft a speech addressing Kennedy's Catholicism and the separation between church and state. At the time, many questioned whether Kennedy, who would go on to become the nation's first Roman Catholic president, would be influenced by the Catholic church. Theodore Sorensen helped write John F. Kennedy's 1960 speech on Catholicism. Speaking to CNN Senior Political Analyst Bill Schneider, Sorensen discussed Kennedy's famous 1960 speech and compared it to the speech on faith in politics delivered Thursday by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who would be the first Mormon in the White House if he is elected. Question: Did Kennedy's 1960 speech win him the presidency? Sorensen: Well, he obviously didn't lose it, nor did he free the country from the curse of anti-Catholicism. The hate mail still poured into his office. The vicious picket signs were still seen out on the campaign trail, and, indeed, on Election Day. According to a University of Michigan survey, more people voted against Kennedy because of his religion than any other reason. Nevertheless, that speech, which was nationally broadcast and frequently rebroadcast, certainly took a lot of the poison out of the anti-Catholic issue and reassured all reasonable people.  Watch Sorensen discuss why Kennedy gave his speech \u00bb . Q. Could President Kennedy have delivered the speech Romney gave on Thursday? Sorensen: No. Mr. Romney's position on many of the issues are very different than JFK's. JFK wanted to particularly stress that he believed in the separation between church and state. He believed that no one needed to worry about a Catholic bishop or a cardinal dictating to him as a president, and that freedom of religion included freedom for those to go to any church or not to go to any church at all. So, Romney emphasized the role of religion in public life more strongly than JFK did or would have. Q. Romney seemed to differ quite strongly...",

Rameau's leg was pinned under concrete. Her mother wanted rescuers to amputate her left leg so she could be pulled out. \"I prefer to die with my two legs,\" said the 13-year-old Wednesday, looking down at her small feet in flowery flip flops. When she heard her mother screaming and crying, she made one last push to get her leg out and free herself. She managed to escape with a big gash, now neatly bandaged. She recounted her story from a makeshift classroom in the cemetery of a Catholic retreat center in the badly damaged neighborhood of Sainte Marie. For Rameau and 400 other fellow students, Wednesday returned a huge sense of normalcy to their lives: school. While aid groups have been delivering water, food and hygiene items to quake-devastated Haitians, few have received counseling for bearing witness to horror. Among them, tens of thousands of children -- some already impoverished and vulnerable -- who now must live with the added burden of terrible memories. Counselors from Israeli aid agency Natan I-Relief have been training the young teachers at Sainte Marie, who themselves suffered in the earthquake, on how to cope with their experiences.

One by one on Wednesday, each child rose in their makeshift classrooms -- some in the open, some in tents with damaged tables salvaged from the wreckage of their old school.

A wounded Iraqi woman cries at a Baquba hospital after being caught in a blast Sunday at a police building. One death came about 9 a.m. when a parked car bomb detonated near the Buratha Shiite mosque in northwestern Baghdad. The blast apparently targeted a convoy belonging to an endowment that manages Shiite mosques in the war-ravaged nation. Three people were wounded in the explosion. A roadside bomb attack an hour earlier struck a police patrol in western Baghdad's Mansour district, the Interior Ministry official said. Two police officers were killed and four others were wounded, he said.

Twelve people were hurt in the blast, including three police officers. The blast also damaged the police headquarters and three civilian automobiles, the police official said.

A U.S. soldier wears protection against chemical weapons during the Gulf War in a February 1991 photo. That illness is a condition now identified as the likely consequence of exposure to toxic chemicals, including pesticides and a drug administered to protect troops against nerve gas. The 452-page report states that \"scientific evidence leaves no question that Gulf War illness is a real condition with real causes and serious consequences for affected veterans.\" The report, compiled by a panel of scientific experts and veterans serving on the congressionally mandated Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, fails to identify any cure for the malady. It also notes that few veterans afflicted with Gulf War illness have recovered over time. \"Today's report brings to a close one of the darkest chapters in the legacy of the 1991 Gulf War,\" said Anthony Hardie, a member of the committee and a member of the advocacy group Veterans of Modern Warfare. \"This is a bittersweet victory, [because] this is what Gulf War veterans have been saying all along,\" Hardie said at a news conference in Washington. \"Years were squandered by the federal government ... trying to disprove that anything could be wrong with Gulf War veterans.\" The committee's report, titled \"Gulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans,\" was officially presented Monday to Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Peake.

            "(CNN) -- Electrical stimulation from a spinal cord implant, mimicking the signals the brain would normally transmit to move the body, has allowed a paralyzed patient to stand on his own and walk on a treadmill with assistance, researchers said Thursday. At a news conference in New York City, doctors introduced Rob Summers, a 25-year-old, paralyzed spinal cord injury patient from Oregon. He received continual epidermal stimulation to the lower spinal cord, researchers said, enabling the muscle and joint movements that are required to stand and, with assistance, to step. \"This stimulation causes changes in the brain and changes in the spinal cord,\" said Dr. V. Reggie Edgerton, a professor in the Departments of Integrative Biology and Physiology and of Neurobiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"Now we need to know how this has occurred.\" A therapy already in use in a number of U.S. hospitals is known as functional electronic stimulation (FES), in which stimulants or electrodes are placed on the skin above the muscles to help chronic spinal cord injury patients move their limbs and, in some cases, walk with assistance. In the newly unveiled procedure, however, the electrodes are implanted in the patient's body. But even beyond that, there are distinct differences in the two procedures, the researchers said. \"In our case it's a constant signal,\" said Dr. Susan Harkema, a professor at the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Louisville. \"FES tries to bypass the circuitry by stimulating the muscles externally with electrodes. We allow the spinal cord to control the muscles on its own.\" The researchers said in the initial phase of their experiment, Summers was able to reach a standing position, supplying the muscular push himself while his spinal cord was being stimulated electrically. He could stand independently, bearing full weight, for up to four minutes at a time He also began to move his toes, ankles, knees and hips while being stimulated. \"This does not represent a cure for..."

He's captured violence in Somalia, Afghanistan, South Ossetia and Libya. But his recent week taking pictures of rebels in Syria was the most intense, frightening experience of his career. He compares it to Afghanistan when he was embedded in 2010 with the French Foreign Legion. \"If there's a fight, the French soldiers are trained; they're going to protect you. They are skilled in combat and can fight back,\" he said. \"In Syria, anything goes. The rebels want you to tell the story, but what they don't tell you is if something bad happens, they spread out. They leave you. You're unprotected. \"For me, the stress level was high at all times.\" See Alpeyrie's photos of rebels and refugees fleeing Syria by dark . Alpeyrie, a 33-year-old French-American, worked with Greek photojournalist George Moutafis, whose Syrian contacts helped lead them across the Turkish border into Syria. They spent one week photographing rebels -- many just ordinary Syrians who've taken up arms -- as they battle military forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Syria has been locked for more than a year in a bloody conflict that began when protesters started demanding that al-Assad relinquish power. The movement grew out of the Arab Spring, a larger phenomenon across the Middle East and North Africa in which Tunisians, Egyptians and Libyans successfully protested for the removal of their leaders in 2011. In Syria, opposition forces report that as many as 10,000 people have died since March 2011. It's been incredibly difficult to know for certain what is happening in Syria because al-Assad has banned journalists from entering the country to cover the conflict. Several journalists who have gotten in to cover the violence have been wounded or killed. Alpeyrie knew the risks. \"I wanted to go,\" he said. Alpeyrie, Moutafis and the Syrians who helped them cross into the country had to move at night in pitch blackness, walking seven miles to a village where rebels and their families were hiding....",

Howard K. Stern  appeared in court on charges connected to the death of Anna Nicole Smith. Howard K. Stern, Smith's lawyer and companion, appeared in Los Angeles County Superior Court, along with Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor to formally hear the charges. Smith's death in a Hollywood, Florida, hotel on February 8, 2007, was ruled to be from \"acute combined drug intoxication,\" the Broward County, Florida medical examiner said. The three are charged with an illegal conspiracy to prescribe, administer and dispense controlled substances to an addict. Stern faces 11 felony counts, while the doctors were charged with six each. They were all charged earlier this year with conspiring to give Smith drugs, but prosecutors revised the counts based on the latest findings from the investigation. The three defendants previously entered \"not guilty\" pleas to those charges. A preliminary hearing is set for next month in the case. A series of affidavits used by state investigators to obtain search warrants in their 2\u00bd-year probe was unsealed and released Tuesday. They revealed new details, including an account of one witness who told investigators she saw Stern inject Smith with drugs. A nanny hired to care for Smith's infant daughter, who was born in the Bahamas in September 2006, told investigators she witnessed Stern and Dr. Eroshevich \"crush pills, heat them to turn them into liquid and inject Smith,\" according to an affidavit from a state investigator. The nanny stated that \"after taking pills or being injected Smith would be 'like you were drinking,' often falling in the house, and sleeping for two or more days at a time,\" California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement Special Agent Danny Santiago said in a sworn statement.

Holm, a star of the Broadway stage and movies, was admitted to New York's Roosevelt Hospital a week ago, but her husband took her home to her Manhattan home on Friday, Phillips said. \"She passed peacefully in her home in her own bed with her husband and friends and family nearby,\" she said. Holm won the best supporting actress Academy Award for \"Gentleman's Agreement\" in 1947. She was nominated for the same honor in 1949 for \"Come to the Stable\" and 1950 for \"All about Eve,\" according to the Academy database. Holm's stage career began in 1936 in a Deer Lake, Pennsylvania, stock company, which led to an understudy role in a touring production of \"Hamlet\" with Leslie Howard, according to her official biography. Her Broadway debut in \"The Time of Your Life\" in 1939 was a small part, but it brought her to the attention of New York critics. Four years later, she was cast as Ado Annie in the smash \"Oklahoma!\" because of her ability to \"sing bad,\" the biography said. She signed a long-term contract with 20th Century Fox that began her film career in 1945, after she toured Europe entertaining troops with the USO. Her first Fox movie was \"Three Little Girls in Blue\" in 1946, a supporting role that earned her star billing for the musical \"Carnival in Costa Rica\" in 1947. Holm's stardom took off in her third film, \"Gentleman's Agreement,\" in which she won the best supporting actress Academy Award for playing fashion editor Anne Dettry. Her official biography said she was challenged in \"finding parts appropriate for this intelligent blonde who didn't fit their Betty Grable 'pin-up girl' mold.\" In 1949, however, she was cast as a \"tennis-playing French nun in \"Come to the Stable,\" which earned her another best supporting actress Oscar nomination, it said.

Every letter counts when you have only 140 characters. Now Google hopes to revolutionize the Web address shortening arena with Goo.gl, now available to the public through its website at http://goo.gl. Goo.gl was originally a proprietary way for Google to abbreviate its Web addresses within services such as Google News (for saving article links) or Google Maps (for sending a location). The new Goo.gl website will abbreviate your links and store them for you to view later or share with others. Google says it is also using special provisions to prevent blind links from leading to malware or dangerous websites. But Google is entering a super-crowded arena. TinyURL has been abbreviating Web addresses for nearly a decade, and the advent of Twitter has encouraged more sophisticated abbreviators, like bit.ly, which allow people to organize and search through their saved links. Individual media sites have also created their own abbreviations: http://nyti.ms for The New York Times, for example, and http://t.co for Twitter. As ReadWriteWeb notes, the biggest advantage Google has over the smaller abbreviators is its massive size and the connection between dozens of its services. That may be enough to make it the top web shortener in short order.",

The Reds legend surprised fans and teammates with the announcement late on New Year's Day that he would leave the club he supported as a boy and has represented on the pitch for the past 17 years when his contract expires in June. Rumors quickly surfaced linking the Liverpool captain with a move to Los Angeles Galaxy, formerly home of ex England star David Beckham. Speaking to Liverpool's in-house TV channel Saturday, the player himself confirmed that the U.S. would be his next destination.

Tropical Cyclone Phailin is expected to make landfall somewhere near the border of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh states in India. The cyclone, which is packing sustained winds of 155 mph (about 250 kph), with gusts of up to 190 mph, could hit densely populated areas that are vulnerable to flooding. Roughly 80,000 people have been evacuated from low-lying areas in the region, with many leaving on foot or by bicycle, said Kamal Lochan Mishra, the Odisha Disaster Management Authority deputy general. Evacuations are continuing, he said. Some fear a repeat of what happened on October 29, 1999, when Cyclone 05B, also known as the Odisha Cyclone, made landfall in the same area, causing the loss of more than 10,000 lives. The strongest tropical cyclone recorded in the Bay of Bengal, it packed winds of 155 mph at landfall and caused more than $2 billion in damage. Phailin may be less intense than that at landfall and is likely to weaken as it moves on shore, but will still bring storm surges and dump heavy rainfall on inland areas in its path. The India Meteorological Department warns that Phailin is a \"very severe cyclonic storm\" and urges the evacuation of coastal areas. The storm will bring gale-force winds and a storm surge that may reach about 10 feet (3 meters) above the usual tide level and could inundate low-lying areas of the Odisha's Ganjam, Khurda, Puri and Jagatsinghpur districts and the Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh during landfall, it said. Rainfall, some of it very heavy, is expected in coastal Odisha and northern Andhra Pradesh starting Friday evening, its forecast said.

UPDATED: . 17:37 EST, 21 January 2014 . An Ohio man claims to have been detained and interrogated by Department of Homeland Security officers for three hours at the weekend, accused of being part of a major film piracy ring, after wearing his Google Glass headpiece to the movies. The man, who wrote a detailed account of the incident to tech website Gadgeteer, said he was at the AMC cinemas in Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday night with his wife when the incident occurred. He was wearing Google Glasses - a 'wearable computer' shaped like eye wear that layers digital information over the real world - which he had his prescription lenses fitted into. About one hour into a showing of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, the man said some 'federal service' agents snatched the glasses from his face and asked him to leave the theater. Google Glasses are 'wearable computers' that were only recently released to a select market. They layer information over real life seen like a computer screen on one eye . The man said between five to 10 police were waiting outside for him and accused him of illegally taping the movie. He told them it was a 'misunderstanding' and that the glasses - which cost him a total $2100 and are capable of being used to record video - were turned off. The man and his wife were taken to a management office inside Easton Mall and interviewed separately. 'I kept telling them that Glass has a USB port and not only did I allow them, I actually insist they connect to it and see that there was nothing but personal photos with my wife and my dog on it,' the man wrote to Gadgeteer. 'I also insisted they look at my phone too and clear things out, but they wanted to talk first. 'They wanted to know who I am, where I live, where I work, how much I\u2019m making, how many computers I have at home, why am I recording the movie, who am I going to give the recording to, why don\u2019t I just give up the guy up the chain, \u2019cause they are not interested in me.

On July 3, 2015, Tatum's stripper with a heart of gold will be back in theaters with a new story after winning over audiences in 2012's \"Magic Mike.\" And instead of simply calling the sequel \"Magic Mike 2,\" Tatum and his team have conjured up a more memorable title: \"Magic Mike XXL.\" Because of course. In the first \"Magic Mike,\" 33-year-old Tatum starred as the titular Mike, a construction worker and aspiring furniture designer by day and magical male stripper by night. Directed by Steven Soderbergh and including stars like Matthew McConaughey, Joe Manganiello and Alex Pettyfer, \"Magic Mike's\" summer 2012 debut was hot enough to earn $113 million domestically. According to Tatum, \"Magic Mike XXL\" will shift the action from Florida nightclubs to the road. \"This one will be a road trip movie,\" he told MTV on Sunday, when he was honored with the network's Trailblazer Award at the 2014 MTV Movie Awards. \"We don't want to make it a serious, slice-of-life movie. We want reality in it, but we don't want to make it some dark drama. There was some darkness in the last one, and I think it surprised people and shocked people. This one, we want there to be a lot of conflict and struggle, but we also want a s***-ton of fun. Just ridiculous stuff that you would never see in a movie.\" Tatum is again writing and producing \"XXL\" with Reid Carolin, with Gregory Jacobs directing. As far as the cast, \"I think everyone's going to be back,\" Tatum said, although he cautioned that deals aren't set in stone. \"Magic Mike XXL\" will follow a very busy few years for Tatum. On the heels of success with 2012's \"21 Jump Street\" and \"Magic Mike,\" the actor has starred in no less than eight films, with three of them still to come this year. His \"21 Jump Street\" sequel with Jonah Hill, \"22 Jump Street,\" arrives June 13, and his sci-fi film with Mila Kunis, \"Jupiter Ascending,\" bows on July 18.",

On the January 18 episode, the rapper dusted off his acting skills -- honed on \"Degrassi: The Next Generation\" -- and seamlessly brought \"SNL\" back from its hiatus with its newest cast member, Sasheer Zamata. Zamata was recently hired after the NBC sketch comedy show was criticized for its noticeable lack of African-American women, and made her debut on January 18. Behind the scenes, \"SNL\" has also added two new African-American women writers, LaKendra Tookes and Leslie Jones. On Saturday, viewers were trying to figure out how \"SNL\" would address its highly publicized hire -- would the show again poke fun at itself by making her take on everyone from the first lady to Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 to Oprah in one sketch, as Kerry Washington did when she hosted last fall, or would it slowly introduce her with just one or two scenes? In the end, \"SNL\" went with a third option: It used Zamata liberally throughout the show as a supporting player, but her debut was virtually overshadowed by the night's host, Drake. In addition to performing, the 27-year-old artist participated in nearly every sketch and nailed them, from his opening monologue that recalled his bar mitzvah ... ... to his impersonation of comedian Katt Williams, and his spoof of colleagues Jay Z and Lil Wayne in \"Before They Were Stars.\" In fact, the one person who won the episode more than Drake was Kate McKinnon and her impersonation of Justin Bieber in the cold open: .

India looked set to run up a massive score in Nagpur but after Tendulkar went for 111 they lost their last nine wickets for just 29 to be bowled out for 296. Paceman Dale Steyn did the damage with a brilliant five-wicket burst but it was still a tough total to chase on a slow pitch. Jacques Kallis, Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers all scored half centuries to keep them in the hunt before Faf du Plessis and JP Duminy plundered late runs. But 13 were still needed off the final over by seamer Ashish Nehra with Robin Peterson on strike and du Plessis at the other end. Only four balls were needed as Peterson hit a four, a massive six and then two runs to pull the scores level. A boundary through the covers clinched victory and left the Indians, who still top Group B, crestfallen. Earlier, Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag put on 142 in just 17.4 overs in an explosive opening stand. Gautam Gambhir (69) joined Tendulkar in another century partnership and a score well in excess of 300 looked on the cards. But Steyn, who was named man-of-the-match for his inspired spell, turned the game his side's way after their disappointing defeat to England in their previous match. Tendulkar has scored 48 one-day international tons to add to his record 51 Test match centuries. Meanwhile, England off-spinner Graeme Swann has been fined 10 per cent of his match fee for his conduct in his side's shock World Cup defeat to Bangladesh Friday. Swann was openly furious that the night-time dew at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury stadium made it difficult for him to grip the ball.",

Passers-by probably assume that I've taken a tumble from said bicycle. They're wrong. So why the tears? It's simple: I feel completely out of control. When I was chosen as a member of the CNN Fit Nation Six-Pack I was thrilled. But almost immediately the fear, doubt and worry set in. In fact, my exact words to Dr. Sanjay Gupta were, \"I'm so excited and a little bit terrified.\" I soon settled into my new fitness routine. Each workout was challenging and, for the most part, served to build my confidence. I was running longer without breaks, I was swimming faster and I stopped falling over on the bike. Three months later I boarded a plane to Clermont, Florida, to meet up with my teammates and coaches for a week of intense triathlon training. The schedule was ambitious, leaving me physically exhausted at the end of each day. But Coach April knew we could rise to the occasion, and we did so repeatedly during the week. A few days into training, we tackled our first group bike ride. For me, this was the first time riding in traffic, and I was anxious. I was paired with Denise Castelli, a Fit Nation alumnus, and we fell into place at the back of the pack. When we took a right and headed onto the main road, I freaked. There was no paved shoulder. We were riding on the white line, and I had to trust that drivers wouldn't plow into me. I was focusing on cycling, clipping in and out of my pedals and following Castelli as close to that white line as possible. Then she asked me to pass her so that she would bring up the rear. My brain just shut down. For the first time in my training, the voice telling me, \"You can't do this\" was simply too loud to ignore. I pulled over and wept. Instead of my usual optimism and tenacity, I was consumed by fear and the foregone conclusion of failure. I was terrified of how close the passing cars felt and how fast they seemed to be zipping by me. I didn't trust..."

That's because on Monday, Nevada became the first to approve a license for \"autonomous vehicles\" -- in other words, cars that cruise, twist and turn without the need for a driver -- on its roads. The license goes to Google, the Silicon Valley technology giant known more for its search engine and e-mail service that nonetheless has been known to dive into other big ideas such as space elevators to Internet-enabled glasses. In a 2010 post on Google's official blog, engineer and Google X founder Sebastian Thrun said that the self-driving vehicle project aims \"to help prevent traffic accidents, free up people's time and reduce carbon emissions by fundamentally changing car use.\" He noted that the \"automated cars use video cameras, radio sensors and a laser range finder to 'see' other traffic, as well as detailed maps ... to navigate the road ahead.\" There is no driver needed, though one is typically in the front seat ready to take control if need be. Earlier this spring, Google said it had \"safely completed over 200,000 miles of computer-led driving.\" Monday marked a new milestone for the project, when Nevada issued a special license after demonstrations on state freeways, state highways, in Carson City neighborhoods and on Las Vegas' landmark Las Vegas Strip, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles said in a news release. The new plate is red and features the infinity symbol and the letters AU, for autonomous vehicle. All such cars on the road are \"test\" vehicles for now, though the state signaled it intends to be \"at the forefront of autonomous vehicle development.\" \"I felt using the infinity symbol was the best way to represent the 'car of the future,' \" state DMV Director Bruce Breslow said. \"When there comes a time that vehicle manufactures market autonomous vehicles to the public, that infinity symbol will appear on a green license plate.\" Google was the first company to apply to test...",

        "In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?\n\nArticle: London (CNN) -- It would be a mistake to write off threats of war against Syria from Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan as mere bluster, assuming that Turkey will maintain the status quo in valuing its relationship with the United States on one hand, while resisting Iran's hegemonic ambitions on the other. The recent cross-border confrontation could ignite regional convulsions as Turkey is sucked into Syria, leading to belated actions on the part of the international community. The Assad regime knows its time is limited as the rate of military and intelligence officers defecting to Jordan and Turkey increases in momentum. Rebel attacks are inching closer to the heart of the Assad regime, such as the recent attack on the Syrian air force intelligence compound in the Damascus suburb of Harasta. This contributes to the regime's recklessness in firing upon Turkey with impunity. Ankara may also be emboldened by the fact that Iran, a key Assad ally, could be limited in its ability to intervene due to its economic woes at home. This week its currency -- the rial -- plummeted in value due to a combination of sanctions and Tehran's own mismanagement of the economy. Turkey has less to lose by responding to Syrian aggression -- this rationale is supported by recent reports that Iran has withdrawn from Syria 275 members from a special operations unit attached to its elite Quds Force. The conflict in Syria is no longer considered a purely internal matter. It clearly has regional ramifications. Thus I believe Turkey's aim to secure its border is inextricably linked with regime change. Its increased military operations may stem from a calculus that it would accelerate the Assad regime's demise. The Turkish parliament's assent for its troops to conduct operations inside Syria is not merely a symbolic attempt to bolster Turkish pride while responding to domestic political pressure over the Syrian attacks. It gives its armed forces the ability to do more than defend its borders. It is also likely that NATO may assist...",

Fathallah's deputy, Dr. Asim Azzam, told the agency that the former leader's vital signs were semi-stable. The 83-year-old Mubarak ruled Egypt for more than 29 years before a popular uprising drove him from office in February. He has been hospitalized since April, after suffering heart palpitations. Prosecutors have said Mubarak suffers from depression, fatigue, repeated irregular heartbeats, low blood pressure that could lead to fainting and an increased risk of heart attack. His lawyer disclosed in June that the ex-president been struggling with complications from 2010 surgery for stomach cancer. On July 18, hospital officials reported that Mubarak had fallen into a coma, but one \"that did not last long,\" Fathallah told CNN. But he is still scheduled to stand trial in August on charges that he ordered police to turn their guns on demonstrators before his ouster -- a charge that carries a possible death sentence. Egyptian officials have said that courts can proceed with a trial if a defendant is in poor health or even on life support. Mubarak and his two sons are also accused of corruption and misusing state funds. He has denied the charges against him."

This barely four weeks are undergoing knee surgery to all but end England's interest in the 2014 World Cup and keep alive Uruguay's hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages. It was a performance that Roy Hodgson's team were all too familiar with -- the Uruguayan scored 31 goals for Liverpool in the league last season -- but could do nothing about. Equally it was a performance that must have been particularly tough on the five Liverpool players that started for England and especially for Steven Gerrard, who played an unfortunate part in Suarez's winning goal. Suarez had watched from the bench as Uruguay stumbled to defeat in their opening match against Costa Rica but he didn't take long to make an impact against England. Plenty of questions had been asked if Suarez could be 100% fit after missing a month's football, but if anything he appeared refreshed by his layoff. A busy first half was capped with a goal six minutes before the break when Suarez headed past goalkeeper Joe Hart after Edinson Cavani's diagonal chip had split England's defense. Suarez almost beat the Manchester City keeper again four minutes into the second half with a low inswinging corner. Hart managed to bat the ball away off the line this time but should have been picking the ball out of the net three minutes later when Cavani was played through.

        "Summarise the article:\n\n(CNN) -- There's learning to read, and then there's loving to read. As the end of the school year approaches, parents are stockpiling ideas to keep their children on top of those long summer reading lists. But how? Bestselling novelist and renowned nonfiction writer Anna Quindlen raised three avid readers who are also a big part of her work. Her eldest son, Quin Krovatin, now 29, helped research and write her 2004 travelogue, \"Imagined London,\" and her fun and foibles as a parent found their way into her other writing, without exposing too many details about them. (\"Books and columns come and go, but your kids are there forever,\" she said.) Quindlen recently took some time on her tour to promote her new novel, \"Still Life with Bread Crumbs,\" to offer some guidance on raising kids who are passionate about reading. It's never too early to read to children -- and don't stop . Quindlen and her husband, Gerald Krovatin, started reading to their three kids from the start. \"We read to them from the time they were very little,\" she said. When Quin was 5, he showed his mother just how much the reading message hit home. \"I took him for a school interview, which is a horrid rite of passage in Manhattan. And the interviewer came out and said, 'And how long has he been reading?' And I said, 'Oh he can't read. He's only in kindergarten.' And she said, 'No, he reads.' I thought, 'Oh I'm the world's worst mother.' \" She laughed, and continued: \"I said, 'Quin? You can read?' He sort of shook his head. And I said, 'Why didn't you tell me?' And he said, 'Because I was afraid you wouldn't read to me anymore.' \"So I told him then that I would read to him forever.\" Just because your children can read, doesn't mean they don't want to share books with their parents. Sharing \"Harry Potter\" with your children can be even more fun than reading it alone the first time. Make reading the reward . Once kids can read by themselves, present books as a treat, rather than a task. Even if their teachers ask them to read at home for 20 minutes a...",

For one: low-cut tops. Another: those sexy Louboutins. \"I really don't need to mention that cleavage and stiletto heels are not appropriate office wear (outside of ridiculous lawyer TV shows), do I?\" asks the author of a memo entitled \"Ethics, Professionalism and Course Requirements for Off Campus Externs\" but then goes on to mention it anyway. \"The legal community is small in L.A. and judges and lawyers who have unprofessional experiences with externs talk freely amongst themselves about the experiences. It can be embarrassing.\" It can also be sexist. I'm talking about the memo, of course, which offers no such guidelines on appearance for men, if we're to assume that men aren't among those whose cleavage and heels are generating whispers within L.A. courtrooms. The memo's implication is that there's a relationship between how women look and how well they do their jobs, and that it's okay to judge a woman on her appearance. It's one thing to acknowledge that a bias exists in society, but quite another to insist on kowtowing to it, and to expectations that are, in most cases, initiated and maintained by men, but not imposed on men. Women are very often reduced to, or at least measured by, their looks, in every industry, and the message can be infuriatingly contradictory. Look good, but not too good. Pay attention to vanity, but don't be obvious about it. Be different, but about the same as everyone else. The Loyola memo noted that the school had received \"complaints from supervisors\" about students' dress, though it isn't specific about the nature or number of the complaints. While it's possible that some women may go overboard, perhaps the topic could have been addressed with the individual(s) against whom the complaints were filed. After all, overboard is both subjective and confusing. At least one law professor advised women to get ahead by wearing \"skirts to appeal to men, makeup...",

            "(CNN) -- The 2014 Formula One season may have only just got going, but Ferrari is already playing catch up. That's the view of technical director James Allison, who admits the legendary Italian marque is some way behind early pacesetters Mercedes, labeling Ferrari's performance in Sunday's opening race as \"unacceptable.\" While Mercedes enjoyed a fruitful preseason and took the checkered flag at Sunday's Australian Grand Prix through Nico Rosberg, Ferrari struggled by comparison. Double world champion Fernando Alonso was the team's highest-placed driver in fourth position, but the Spaniard finished over 30 seconds behind the victorious Rosberg. \"While we can take some satisfaction from the reliability shown by the F14T, it is clear that we have our work cut out to improve our car in order to compete on equal terms with the Mercedes team,\" Allen told the team's official website. Alonso finished Sunday's race in fifth position, but he was elevated to fourth place after Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo -- who crossed the line in second -- was disqualified for breaching fuel flow regulations. Finland's Kimi Raikkonen, who is starting his second spell as a Ferrari driver after winning the team's last drivers' championship in 2007, finished seventh. Like every team on the grid, Ferrari has had to contend with a raft of regulation changes introduced by the sport's rule makers for the 2014 season -- including the introduction of 1.6-liter V6 hybrid engines. Allison says his team is still coming to terms with the new rules, but he's backed Ferrari to come back stronger than ever. \"With all the new regulations this year, the opportunities to improve the car are legion and we can expect the race to improve the cars to be even more intense than normal,\" he added. \"Our competitiveness was not acceptable in Melbourne, but we intend to fight our way back up the grid with the improvements that we will bring to the car.\" Meanwhile the FIA, the body which governs F1, has announced its satisfaction with the fuel-flow meter which..."

You would think I had issued a declaration of war. And maybe, the way some folks look at it, I had. My defense of the \"Meet the Press\" moderator followed the much-publicized spectacle in which he brandished on the air a high-capacity magazine during an interview with the National Rifle Association's chief executive. This was, to be sure, something of a stunt. It made for a great visual. It gave Gregory a prop as he asked Wayne LaPierre whether, if 30-bullet magazines like the one in his hand were banned, \"isn't it just possible that we could reduce the carnage in a situation like Newtown?\" Next, as you've probably heard, came word that the police department in Washington was investigating Gregory for a potential violation of the city's gun laws. Possession of high-capacity magazines is illegal in Washington, even if they are empty. It didn't help matters when the police said that NBC had asked for permission to show the ammunition on the air and was turned down. Nor has NBC's silence on the matter aided Gregory's case. Watch: Is Chelsea Clinton a 'pretend journalist' for NBC? But let's get real here. David Gregory's only intent was to commit journalism. Why are the cops wasting time on this, other than as a PR gesture to demonstrate that they're somehow on the case? It's fine to lambaste what Gregory did on the air. He walked right up to the line, and some would say crossed it, of pushing LaPierre to acknowledge that some form of gun control would be sensible. And maybe holding up ammunition for the cameras was grandstanding. Watch: Twitter filled with sickening death wishes for George H.W. Bush . But there is a vitriol in the many messages, tweets and posts accusing me of not understanding that a journalist isn't above the law. On that point, I couldn't agree more.

A senior Republican strategist told CNN that GOP candidates are being encouraged to talk about the issue as much as possible. In Florida, Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott launched a statewide television ad Monday criticizing Obama for backing the right of Muslims to build an Islamic center and mosque two blocks from where the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks killed more than 2,700 people. \"Barack Obama says building a mosque at ground zero is about tolerance,\" Scott says in the ad, looking directly into the camera. \"He's wrong. It's about truth.\" The \"truth,\" Scott claims, is this: \"Muslim fanatics murdered thousands of innocent Americans on 9/11, just yards from the proposed mosque.\" \"The fight against terrorism isn't over,\" Scott concludes. \"Mr. President, ground zero is the wrong place for a mosque.\" Meanwhile, a House Democratic leadership aide said the issue was dominating the political conversation when Democrats need to stress campaign themes such as economic recovery and saving social security. \"We understand why the president would want to talk about this issue, but the timing couldn't have been any worse,\" the House Democratic leadership aide told CNN. Despite the concerns of Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada on Monday came out against building the Islamic center and mosque. \"The First Amendment protects freedom of religion. Sen. Reid respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built some place else,\" said a statement issued by Reid's spokesman, Jim Manley.

This summer in New Mexico, Felix Baumgartner hopes to make the highest, longest and fastest fall ever. His attempt will take him to an altitude where the atmosphere ends and space begins -- where blood boils at body temperature, and the air temperature could be as low as minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The first step in the attempt will be riding a helium balloon to an altitude of 120,000 feet above sea level -- almost 23 miles -- higher than anyone has ascended in a balloon before. Then, wearing a pressurized suit and oxygen tanks, he plans to jump out of his capsule for a five-minute fall back to Earth. Within the first 30 seconds, he expects to be falling faster than the speed of sound, which at that altitude is around 690 miles per hour. Crossing that barrier would mark a new test of the limits of the human body. \"This is what we want to find out: What happens to the human body when it breaks the speed of sound,\" Baumgartner said. \"That's a big question mark.\" To increase his chances of survival, his parachute is set to open automatically, even if he's unconscious or spinning so fast his hands are pinned by the G-force. He said his engineers are taking every precaution, testing out the suit in a wind tunnel and providing him with a backup chute, sealed gloves and boots, and an advanced helmet. \"This helmet also has face-shield heating to make sure your visor's not getting fogged up on the way down, because that would be fatal,\" he said. \"If you don't see anything, you can't move anymore. You can't make decisions.\" Still, the risk of the unknown remains. \"If something happens, it happens fast,\" he said. \"You can never say you're not going to get killed under any circumstances,\" but \"we have a lot of solutions for emergency situations like this.\" A chain reaction of events would have to occur before the jump could turn fatal, he said.

        "Extract key points from the article based on which the stock market could react:\n\n(CNN)Desperately pursuing a nuclear deal with Iran, scrapping old positions and offering new concessions at a mind-boggling pace, the Obama administration has lost sight of what this regime represents and why the United States and its allies have focused on its nuclear program to begin with. For more than a decade, U.S. leaders vowed to prevent Iran from acquiring or developing the technology and know-how of nuclear weaponry for a simple reason: we did not want one of the world's most dangerous regimes to possess (and potentially use or distribute) the world's most dangerous weapons. That's why, starting under President George W. Bush, Washington rallied the international community around increasingly tough sanctions that would remain in place until Tehran comes clean about its nuclear program and the world could rest assured that it would not develop nuclear weaponry. To his credit, President Barack Obama led global efforts to further tighten the screws on Iran, which threatened that nation with economic collapse and coaxed Iranian leaders to the negotiating table. Nevertheless, the President now seems prepared to ink a deal that would put Iran on the cusp of nuclear weaponry and eventually lift all sanctions, raising the same specter of a very dangerous regime with the most dangerous weapons -- even though the regime has not changed its ideology, its motives, or its behavior in any significant way since the Islamic Republic was founded in 1979. As Obama has suggested in public comments, the administration envisions that, with a nuclear deal, Iran can emerge from the isolation in which the sanctions have put it and take its rightful place as a responsible player in the Middle East, working with other nations to stabilize the region. From its earliest days, however, and through two Supreme Leaders and multiple Presidents, the regime in Tehran has been expansionist in the region and beyond, destabilizing of its neighbors, murderous in its activities, and, most fundamentally, anti-American in its approach....",

After 14 of 18 meetings, the Australian holds a 44-point lead over world champion Jorge Lorenzo, who will start Sunday's race second on the grid for Yamaha at Motegi. He broke Lorenzo's 2008 lap record with a time of one minute 45.267 seconds to earn his first pole at the circuit, where he won last year's race. Stoner's teammate Andrea Dovizioso qualified third ahead of another Honda rider, Dani Pedrosa, while American Ben Spies claimed fifth for Yamaha. Honda's Marco Simoncelli completed the third row for Honda, while fellow Italian and seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi was seventh for Ducati. Hiroshi Aoyama, in 11th, was the highest-placed Japanese rider for what will be an emotional day. Motorcycling's top names had initially refused to travel to Motegi due to health fears after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was damaged during March's earthquake and tsunami. They backed down after MotoGP officials refused to cancel the race, but Stoner arrived late to reduce any exposure to radiation and Lorenzo told reporters that he had been washing with bottled water despite experts insisting the Motegi area is safe from any fallout.

We've been fastest in all but one session, so it's been fantastic,\" 2007 world champion Stoner told the MotoGP website. \"We'll have to watch the weather as this will affect the set-up.

As the Denver Broncos quarterback approaches the second round of the NFL playoffs, a documentary offers a detailed look at his quest to convince the teams that he could bring his college success to the pro level. With typical humility, he says he just hopes the film inspires young people. \"I hope it's a positive message for kids who (are) trying to accomplish their dreams,\" he told ESPN's Bill Williamson. \"I want to show them that there are adversity and obstacles for everyone, but you can make it. I am honestly living my dream, but I had adversity and obstacles. I want kids to get hope from this.\" Yeah, some of you are rolling your eyes. But Tebow genuinely believes that. And that's one of the messages of the film, says Chase Heavener, who directed \"Tim Tebow: Everything in Between.\" Tim Tebow is exactly what he appears to be: a hard-working, squeaky-clean, all-American guy. \"It's really cool to see that it's true. He is who he says he is,\" Heavener said. Heavener is something of an expert on this subject. He's not just a filmmaker who followed the man who is now arguably the most famous quarterback in America. He's also a friend. Heavener's dad and Tebow's dad were college roommates and have stayed buddies. That friendship uniquely positioned the younger Heavener to ask the Heisman Trophy winner and two-time national champion to be filmed constantly through winter 2010. Heavener and his team at Fiction, a video production company, ended up with more than 1,000 hours of film, which were edited to 50 minutes when ESPN picked up the television rights to the project. It was shot in the months between Tebow's last collegiate game and the night he was drafted by the Broncos. The film debuted in January 2011 with \"very impressive\" ratings, ESPN publicist Jennifer Cingari said, and \"it has done well in re-airs, too.\" The documentary will get three more airings before Saturday night's Divisional Round game pitting the Broncos at the heavily favored New England Patriots....",

            "(CNN) -- A Syrian airstrike in Aleppo has killed at least 15 people, including nine children, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Saturday. A single bomb landed in the mostly Kurdish district of Sheikh Maksoud, the group said. Kurdish activists say the number of dead is expected to rise because there are many injured and in critical condition. Amateur video purporting to show the site of the bombing appeared on the Internet shortly after the attack, providing a glimpse of a panicked scene. Fires burned in a building and in a destroyed vehicle, the video showed. People shouted as they ran from victim to victim; some who were not moving. Bystanders began to pick up the unmoving bodies and place them in the back of a pick-up truck, the video shows. CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the video. Syrian forces have been clashing for several days with Kurdish militias on the outskirts of the district, the Syrian Observatory said. Another opposition group, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, said 116 people were killed across the country Saturday, including 37 in Aleppo. CNN cannot independently verify death tolls or other accounts of violence in Syria. The war in Syria has been raging since March 2011 when protesters, partly inspired by Arab Spring uprisings in the region, began demonstrating for more freedom. That movement quickly morphed into a movement against President Bashar al-Assad, who was appointed president by Syria's parliament in 2000 after his father died. The government responded with a brutal crackdown. In February, the United Nations estimated that 70,000 people had been killed in the fighting."

Attorney Tim Herman in an email to CNN Sports late Friday did not address whether Armstrong told associates -- as reported by the newspaper -- that he was considering the admission as a way to restore his athletic eligibility. Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life last year after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency found there was overwhelming evidence that he was directly involved in a sophisticated doping program. Silence falls as Austin awaits Armstrong's 'last word' Armstrong has repeatedly and vehemently denied that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs as well as illegal blood transfusions during his cycling career. In the past, Armstrong has argued that he took more than 500 drug tests and never failed. In its 202-page report that detailed Armstrong's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions, the USADA said it had tested Armstrong less than 60 times and the International Cycling Union conducted about 215 tests. The agency did not say that Armstrong ever failed a test, but his former teammates testified as to how they beat tests or avoided the tests altogether. The New York Times, citing unnamed associates and anti-doping officials, said Armstrong has been in discussions with USADA officials and hopes to meet with David Howman chief of the World Anti-Doping Agency. The newspaper said none of the people with knowledge of Armstrong's situation wanted to be identified because it would jeopardize their access to information on the matter. Under World Anti-Doping Agency rules, an athlete who confesses to using performance-enhancing drugs may be eligible for a reinstatement.

Moments later, a bomb disposal expert dressed in the heavy green armor made famous in the movie \"Hurt Locker\" walked briskly away from the suspicious package. Another member of the team counted down loudly in Greek, and then a controlled explosion echoed down the empty boulevard. Authorities later said the package was not a bomb, but that wasn't the case earlier Thursday, when police destroyed another parcel at a courier office. Hellenic Police spokesman Maj. Athanasios Kokkalakis confirmed the parcel contained a \"booby trap bomb.\" The parcel was addressed to the French Embassy in Athens and the bombers put the archbishop of Athens as the sender of the package. Greek officials said it was the 14th explosive device to be discovered originating from Greece in the past four days. The events came as the two suspects in the largest letter-bomb campaign in Greek history were remanded into custody after appearing for testimony before a prosecutor, the Citizens Protection Ministry said. The two men are accused of participating in a wave of attempted bombings that has forced the Greek government to suspend air postal deliveries outside of the country for 48 hours. They were arrested in Athens on Monday in possession of two parcel bombs, Glock pistols, a bulletproof vest, and a wig. Many of the packages were addressed to various embassies in Athens, but one arrived at German Chancellor Angela Merkel's office in Berlin and another, addressed to Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, made it to Italy.

Now that the crazy is nearly two years in the past, the ex-\"Two and a Half Men\" star is actually ashamed of his behavior. (Well, some of it, anyway.) When David Letterman asked last night if Sheen ever feels embarrassed when he thinks back on the spring of 2011, the actor answered the question quickly and matter-of-factly: \"Of course. Have you seen some of those interviews? That stuff's out there forever, man.\" That said, Sheen still seems proud of his very public crackup's sheer audacity. \"I booked a 21 city tour in 33 days with no act!\" he crowed at one point during the Letterman interview, sounding equally incredulous and boastful. He also didn't miss a chance to take a swipe at his old sitcom, even as he revealed that he'd like to return to the show for its last episode: \"I am dead,\" Sheen said, referring to the convenient subway accident that killed off his character at the beginning of season 9, \"but so's the show.\" How's that for a violent torpedo of truth? As funny as Sheen's quip is, it's not entirely accurate \u2014 CBS entertainment president Nina Tassler told TV critics last week that the network wants to bring Men back for an 11th season next fall, though a renewal has not yet been finalized. (Cast member Angus T. Jones is expected to stick with the show as well, even though he loosed his own Sheen-ian Men slam last fall.) And despite Sheen's wishes, it seems unlikely that Men creator Chuck Lorre \u2014 the man Sheen once called a \"sad silly fool,\" an \"a-hole p---y loser\" and a \"low rent, nutless sociopath\" \u2014 would welcome his ex-star back into the fold.

        "Sum the following article in brief: Las Vegas (CNN) -- Sony says it's not quite game over for the PlayStation 3. Contrary to reports, Sony does not plan to announce a new home video-game console at a trade show in June, said Kazuo Hirai, the company's deputy president. \"We're not making announcements at E3,\" Hirai told a roomful of reporters at the 2012 International Consumer Electronics Show here Tuesday when asked about plans to announce the PlayStation 4. E3 is the annual convention in Los Angeles where game companies typically make their biggest announcements. The five-year-old PlayStation 3 will have a 10-year life cycle, Hirai said. Sony could still release a new system sometime in the next five years, of course. Sony continued to sell the PlayStation 2 system and games years after the PlayStation 3 debuted in stores. For Sony's next console, the company will not deploy a streaming delivery system like OnLive, or fully cut out disc retailers like Best Buy and GameStop, Hirai said. While Sony has increased the number of games and other media available for download or streaming through its networks, most people cannot be expected to frequently download several gigabytes worth of data, which can be a time-consuming process, he said. Sony Computer Entertainment president Andrew House said earlier that Sony is not planning to discuss a new console, the website ComputerAndVideogames.com reported on Monday. He also said that physical media, like Blu-ray discs, are currently the optimal way to deliver full games. Sony released a new hand-held game system, the PlayStation Vita, in Japan last month. It plans to start selling the Wi-Fi and AT&T 3G versions of that system in the United States on February 22. Like Microsoft has done with the Xbox 360 through Kinect, Sony is trying to extend the life of the PlayStation 3 through new accessories, like the Move controller wand, and initiatives like 3-D games. There are dozens of 3-D games now available, Hirai noted. \"We are definitely, from a Sony perspective, very committed to 3-D,\" Hirai said. \"It's...",

Josh Hakken is insane and will likely be sent to a hospital for treatment before he can stand trial for the alleged kidnapping, Hillsborough Circuit Judge Chet Tharpe said Wednesday, CNN affiliate Bay News 9 reported. The ruling adds another chapter to the bizarre story of Hakken, his wife and their two sons. Some of the tale unfolded last year on CNN. Last April, Florida authorities said Josh and Sharyn Hakken kidnapped their two boys, ages 2 and 4, after losing custody of them. The boys were taken from the Tampa home of their grandmother. The story gained international attention when authorities said there was evidence that Hakken could have fled the country with the boys. Later that month, CNN found the family of four on a small sailboat in Havana. Josh Hakken glared through his sunglasses at the CNN reporter who found him and said nothing beyond confirming his identity. The two boys are OK, said a woman matching the description of his wife, and she left it at that. Cuban security officials wearing sidearms appeared as a CNN video crew was filming and ordered them to stop. Cuban authorities then detained Josh and Sharyn Hakken. The boys were returned to their grandparents. Both Hakkens were also returned to U.S. to stand trial. As for the fate of Sharyn Hakken? Her trial has been postponed, Bay News 9 reported. The judge also wants to check her psychological reports. 'Back to normal' for abducted kids, grandmother says .",

        "In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?\n\nArticle: Euphoria reigned in many parts of Barcelona and the surrounding region of Catalonia on Monday, a day after 1.6 million people there cast symbolic votes to secede from Spain. But the sentiment for Catalan independence was not shared in Madrid, where there was skepticism, as Spain's Justice Minister called the straw vote a \"farce\" without any democratic validity. Even after more than 2 million Catalans voted on Sunday, defying two decisions by Spain's highest court that it was illegal to cast a ballot on independence, the two entrenched sides -- the Catalan government in Spain's second largest city of Barcelona and the Spanish government in the capital, Madrid -- seemed no closer to solving the thorny issue. Catalan secessionists have staged massive street demonstrations in recent years, and they picked up more steam in September around Scotland's referendum on independence. Although Scots voted to remain in the United Kingdom, many Catalans insisted Madrid should let them vote, too, as London had done for Scotland. But the Spanish government insists that the constitution does not permit just one of Spain's 17 regions, such as Catalonia, to unilaterally secede. None of that mattered on Sunday to many in Catalonia, in northeast Spain, where the regional government, backed by 40,000 volunteers instead of regular election officials, staged the symbolic vote. The result was heavily in favor of independence, but analysts said many who opposed secession simply didn't bother to vote, since it was non-binding. Turnout was about 32%, far lower than the nearly 70% who voted in regional, binding, parliamentary elections two years ago. Catalonia represents about 20% of Spain's economy and already has broad home-rule powers, including its own parliament, police force and control over education and health. The region also has a long list of grievances with Madrid, including over taxation. The Catalan president, Artur Mas, on Sunday called on Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to negotiate a \"definitive\" referendum. But...",

The pair fought it out Monday in the \"Match at Mission Hills\" on Hainan Island and it was Northern Ireland's McIlroy who edged it by one shot after 18 holes. The 24-year-old carded a six-under 67 against 68 for Woods - repeating his win of 2012 in the corresponding event. \"I would like to play all my tournaments in China where I can beat Tiger,\" McIlroy joked after his narrow win. \"It's been great to come back to this wonderful golf course where I still have such great memories from playing here two years ago in the World Cup,\" he told AFP. McIllroy won the World Cup in 2011 with Graeme McDowell at the same venue and will be hoping his improved form can be carried over to next week's WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai. He needs a solid finish to get into the top 60 and qualify for the European Tour's Race to Dubai, an event McIlroy won last year to round off a superlative season. He is currently languishing in 62nd place in the rankings, a far cry from his triumphs of 2012 as he rose to No.1. \"I still have four tournaments left to the end of the season and still would love to finish 2013 strongly and get some momentum into next season,\" he said. \"I'm hitting the ball well and from tee-to-green the game is very solid and if I can get the putter working, I maybe can contend and get a win or two.\" By contrast, Woods has won five PGA Tour events this year, but has missed out on adding to his major tally of 14.

Gabrielle Giffords was in Tucson Monday to finish what she started -- a \"Congress on Your Corner\" meeting that was interrupted by gunfire, a shooting rampage that left six people dead and Giffords with a gunshot wound to her head just over a year ago. The meeting came one day after Giffords, 41, announced that she would resign from Congress this week. \"We were invited to finish what we started a year ago. I know that every person amongst us has been waiting for that moment. I told her what I wanted to tell her a year ago, and then I told her how sorry I was that I couldn't really introduce her to Christina,\" said Suzi Hileman, one of the roughly two dozen people invited to attend the private event.

Hileman herself was shot three times in the rampage. \"When I said that Christina would have grown up to be her, she took my hand,\" Hileman said about Giffords. \"She's my hero ...

They are but improved means to an unimproved end.\" - Henry David Thoreau . The March on Washington in 1963 was a day for great speeches. Of course, no one knew that the day would also include one of the most famous speeches of the 20th century, Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" oration (actually titled, \"Normalcy No More\"). In fact, King's adviser and draft speechwriter, Clarence B. Jones, says that with everyone consumed by march logistics, the speech was not their highest priority, and hours before the event while King was considering a theme for his speech he didn't know exactly what he would say. Ah, the triumph of procrastination. It was a different time, a time when politicians like JFK and preachers like MLK made efforts to craft big ideas in beautiful language. It was the age of thriving newspapers and bookstores. Back then, audiences listened expectantly for the art of rhetoric. They demanded that speakers respect them enough to put real effort and poetry into their publicly spoken words. And, they listened without the pressure and distraction of multitasking on mobile devices. They listened patiently, even while sweating profusely in the August heat. What about today, in the age of social media? Would Martin Luther King, Jr. be an active social media communicator? And, a more important question: How well would Martin Luther King, Jr.'s gift for rhetoric translate over social networks? Opinion: 50 years later, civil rights struggle is far from over . The answer to both questions is positive. As a public theologian he had an encyclopedic knowledge of political writings and literature. He had an amazing ability to educate, inspire and mobilize people through language and speech. He would have recognized that social media is the public square of the 21st century.

It's likely they began right here at Mount Vernon Mills, one of the last functioning cotton mills in America and the nation's No. 1 producer of denim. In a tiny enclave of northwest Georgia, Wolfe and 1,200 of his colleagues churn out enough denim per week for 800,000 pairs of blue jeans. Most U.S. mills shut down years ago, unable to compete with cheap overseas labor. And in another sign of the global economy, the fabric woven here is rarely sent to American plants to be turned into jeans. Instead, the fabric is shipped mostly to factories in Mexico. The jeans then carry labels that read \"Made in Mexico of U.S. fabric.\" Blame NAFTA. Blame outsourcing. Blame corporate greed for the selling out of America's manufacturing soul. \"I'd rather see people over here work, instead of struggling -- instead of giving somebody in another country a chance to make money that [Americans] should be making,\" says Wolfe, 31.

Gary Irving, 52, learned his fate in Norfolk Superior Court, the same court that convicted him more than three decades ago. Norfolk District Attorney Michael W. Morrissey expressed remorse to the women Irving raped and apologized for the long wait for justice. \"I am sorry that so much strength and perseverance was asked of you. That the courage and resolve you showed testifying in 1979 resulted in decades of continuing injustice. Today does not erase that injustice, but does end it,\" he said after Irving's sentencing. Irving will serve two consecutive 18- to 20-year sentences with a 7- to 10-year concurrent sentence on kidnapping charges. He will also serve 20 years' probation for all other charges, said Norfolk district attorney's office spokesman David Traub in an e-mail to CNN. \"We felt that the calculated brutality of these crimes, the repeated nature of these attacks, warranted a very long prison term. We are pleased that the court has now ordered a long prison term,\" Morrissey said in a statement. In 1979, Irving was convicted of three counts of rape with force, unnatural acts and kidnapping, Massachusetts State Police said. In one incident, Irving knocked the victim off her bike and took her to a secluded area, where he repeatedly raped her. During another attack, Irving threatened a victim with a knife if she did not comply with his sexual demands. A 12-member jury found him guilty on all counts. The judge -- new to the job -- offered him a weekend to put his affairs in order before reporting to jail. Irving never returned. Instead, he fled Massachusetts and landed on the state's Most Wanted list, where he remained for 34 years.

        [
            "UTTAR PRADESH, India (CNN) -- On World Population Day this year India's new health and welfare minister came out with an idea on how to tackle the population issue: Bring electricity to every Indian village so that people would watch television until late at night and therefore be too tired to make babies. Could the remote control be a birth control method? That statement raised eyebrows across this vast country -- but what are the realities and reactions from families who make up the second largest population in the world? At 80-plus years old Omar Mohammed has never heard of population control. He lives in India's most populous state Uttar Pradesh and has certainly done his part in contributing to India's burgeoning population. \"Now you see I have 24 children, 13 boys and 11 girls,\" Omar says. Omar believes only God can decide how many children you should have. He lifts his hands to the sky and says: \"This is His command. It's not my doing, it's His doing.\" On the other hand there's the Arora family in the capital city of Delhi. They have two children. \"You can't even get enough water or electricity now. So its advisable that people have only two children and then they should stop having more kids.\" mother Anjana Arora says. The Aroras know a little something about population issues; their daughter was given the official title of India's one billionth citizen when she was born in 2000. With family planning and free contraceptive programs the Indian government has long tried to encourage families to have only two children. Overall government statistics show the birth rate is coming down. The numbers show 14 of India's 35 states have reached the two child per family target. But the push is failing in other states, especially in villages and among the poor and illiterate where the fertility rate is as high as 3.5 children per woman. There are all kinds of reasons -- from the desire to continue having children until a son is born to lack of access to contraceptives. The government's concern is that a booming..."

Authorities believe that Norma, who had planned to meet a younger sister and a friend at home, took a short cut through a dirt field to reach the family's residence. Her sister contacted the police when Lopez failed to return home. The girl's body was discovered Tuesday two miles away and identified Wednesday through dental records, police said. \"I always thought it was something safe,\" Lopez said about the path her sister typically followed. \"I never suspected that my sister would get kidnapped in this empty lot of just dirt.\" Sgt. Joe Barja of the Riverside Valley Sheriff's Department declined to reveal the cause of death or reveal any injuries Lopez may have sustained but said the department is treating the death as a homicide.

Prosecutors say Levi Aron abducted the boy, Leiby Kletzky, from his Brooklyn neighborhood on July 11. The accused then took Leiby to his apartment and killed him, they contend. Aron pleaded not guilty Thursday in a Brooklyn courtroom. Aron did not enter a plea at his arraignment last month, and he was under a suicide watch. A mental evaluation that his attorneys asked be conducted on their client was revealed in court Thursday. Kings County District Attorney Charles Hynes applauded the decision. \"Now that Mr. Aron has been found fit to proceed we will move forward expeditiously to bring his case to trial. I want to reaffirm that this case will go to trial and that there are absolutely no circumstances which would lead me to accept a plea bargain,\" Hynes said. New York City's chief medical examiner said that Leiby died after being drugged and then smothered. The autopsy results for Leiby listed a cocktail of four prescription and over-the-counter drugs in the boy's system: cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant; quetiapine, an antipsychotic drug; hydrocodone, a pain medication; and acetaminophen, the drug found in Tylenol, according to the medical examiner's office. Leiby disappeared while walking home alone from summer day camp. Police located human remains in Aron's freezer during a search of the Brooklyn neighborhood as well as in a trash bin. Both Aron and Leiby are members of the borough's close-knit Orthodox Jewish community, although police say it doesn't appear that they knew each other. \"Everybody says, 'We're not going to talk about it,' but how can you not talk about it? How can you not talk about a tragedy that has affected every single family,\" Assemblyman Dov Hikind told CNN affiliate WCBS-TV. Authorities have detailed some of the evidence they allege links Aron to the kidnapping and killing -- including...",

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- Some of the nation's top experts Tuesday were looking for clues into sudden, mass deaths of birds in two states over New Year's weekend. \"This one is unusual because of the time period over which so many birds died,\" said LeAnn White, a field investigator with the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin. The center, part of the U.S. Geological Survey, is receiving samples from Arkansas, where as many as 5,000 red-winged blackbirds and starlings fell from the sky in a square-mile area in less than an hour on New Year's Eve, according to the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission. The center will also examine samples from Louisiana, where 500 red-winged blackbirds, starlings and grackles were found dead in Labarre. A preliminary report conducted Monday by the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission found that the birds in Beebe, Arkansas, likely died from massive trauma. There had been reports of loud sounds in Beebe before the reports of birds falling began to come in. It's possible the sounds made the birds disoriented, and they went into sudden, chaotic flights, crashing into each other and into objects, White said. \"You're disturbed, you're disoriented, you're trying to figure out where you are. We have seen some stuff like this before when there's heavy dense fog, and they'll run into towers and power lines,\" she said. Other bird experts agree that that's a likely explanation. Still, the sudden deaths are quite unusual. \"It's kind of a freak event,\" said Greg Butcher, director of bird conservation for the National Audubon Society. \"You just don't see these kinds of mass deaths very frequently at all.\" At this time of year, blackbirds are in huge roosts, particularly throughout the southeastern United States, he said. They generally don't fly at night. \"In the course of a year, about half the birds that are around die -- even under the best circumstances. The life of a bird is brutish and short. But it just usually happens out of the sight of people,\" said Butcher. It's possible that the...",

The Elephant Parade, created by Marc Spits in 2006, invites artists and celebrities to design and decorate large elephant statues to be displayed in public spaces. This year's collection includes pieces from fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg and local actor Donnie Yen. The statues were auctioned off on Thursday at Island Shangri-La, Hong Kong. The auction raised HK$2,150,000 ($277,398) for the herd of 31 elephants. Proceeds will be donated to the Asia Elephant Foundation, whose conservation efforts range from funding hospitals to lobbying governments. Idea born from a baby elephant . The idea was born in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Spits was vacationing in the northern Thai city in 2006 when he met Mosha at an elephant hospital. The baby elephant had lost her front right leg after stepping on a landmine. \"The hospital said it would like to operate on the elephant and give her a prosthetic leg but didn't have the money for that,\" says Mike Spits, co-founder of the parade and Marc's son. The first Elephant Parade was held in Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 2007. Since then, the colorful pachyderms have been auctioned off around the world. The herd arrived in Hong Kong's Pacific Place, City Plaza and Citygate Outlets for the first time in August. Spits says humans are the biggest threat to elephants. \"The speed of human development, particularly in this part of the world, leads to a fight for space,\" says Spits. \"And the elephant often loses that fight.\"",

            "(CNN) -- A Zambian judge has granted bail to two Chinese men charged with attempted murder in a mine shooting that has revived an outcry against foreign employers in the southern African nation. Chinese managers at a mine in the southern part of the nation used shotguns to fire at a gathering of workers last month. The miners, who were protesting poor labor conditions, were unarmed, according to Zambian government officials. At least 11 miners were wounded. \"Where did the Chinese get the right to shoot innocent Zambians, including my son,\" asked Leonard Kapwizi. Kapwizi's question reverberates with other Zambians, some of whom say foreign employers are increasingly above the law. Kapwizi's son, Vincent Chenjele, was hospitalized. Three Chinese employees were also injured and mine equipment damaged, according to Chinese state media. The two suspects --detained for more than two weeks -- appeared before a judge Tuesday on 13 counts of attempted murder. They were ordered to surrender their passports. The shooting at Collum is the latest in a string of attacks between Zambian workers and Chinese managers at the coal mine. In June, Zambian state media reported that a Chinese national \"escaped lynching by an angry mob\" after 22 miners were seriously injured in a gas explosion. In late 2009, Collum mine workers \"threw missiles\" at Chinese managers after receiving \"slave wages,\" according to Zambian state media. Zambian officials have worked to quell the anti-Chinese outbursts that have followed such incidents. \"Let us be careful that we don't single out [Chinese] people,\" President Rupiah Banda said after the recent shootings. \"Every day people are shot by Zambians; are shot by white people; are shot by the Americans; they are shot by everybody.

Brandon Boyd, front man for Incubus, is going on the road with the band in July. He surfs. Shuns Starbucks in favor of the local smoothie shop. Walks his French bulldog, Bruce. Oh, he also paints and makes music with his multiplatinum rock band, Incubus. The quintet hits the road on a North American summer tour in July, and just released a greatest hits collection called \"Monuments and Melodies.\" The packaging features artwork by Boyd, who held his first solo art exhibit at Mr. Musichead Rock Art Gallery in Los Angeles last fall. The showroom is on the Sunset Strip, a stone's throw from the clubs that were host to Incubus' first gigs. The most spectacular paintings are large, fantasy-inspired pieces drenched in burgundy or aqua. Usually, the artwork springs to life in a corner of the singer's kitchen, where an easel permanently resides. It's a zen-like space, with high ceilings, glossy concrete floors and warm, burnished wood. But instead of the requisite Buddha statue, there's a rubber rabbit's head for inspiration. The muse seems ironic and appropriate, especially since Boyd swears his home was a brothel back in the 1900s. CNN talked to Boyd about collaboration, the fulfillment of art and finding the perfect wave. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Isn't it ironic that you had your first solo art show before your first solo album? Brandon Boyd: I've actually thought very little about solo work up until just very recently. Most of it is because in my band, Incubus, it is very much a collaborative effort. I do what I do in the band, and everyone plays their respective parts, but in the end, we are sort of a democratic process. We meet in the middle for a lot of the songs, and I think that's why we sound the way we do -- because it's sort of five minds meeting in the middle. With my art thing, it's completely self-indulgent.  Watch the singer discuss his art \u00bb . CNN: So..."

        "Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?\n\nArticle: The first time I walked down the main drag in Wan Chai in Hong Kong, I couldn't believe what I saw; all the mama bars there and prostitutes openly in the street outside trying to get guys to go in. Within the first week I'd already been offered cocaine, though I didn't take it at that stage. When I did, it was easy to get. I know 100 guys between the ages of 20 and 50, and I'd say around 30 of them were regular cocaine users. Not all were working in banking, but most were, of the ones I knew. They were all Westerners. I know guys in banking in London, Chicago and Sydney and they've all got the same pressures as Hong Kong. Yes, I know some cocaine users in those cities, but the ratio of the people I know to the ratio of people I know who are drug users is minimal -- it's almost non-existent. So it can only really be down to two things -- the availability of it and how many people do it; the general acceptance of it in Hong Kong. When I read the news of the murders in Wan Chai, allegedly by a British banker, my first reaction was \"I hope I don't know him, please don't be someone I know,\" because it easily could have been. I knew some guys who were seriously screwed up and now I realize just how much I had changed in Hong Kong, almost inhuman at times. Getting drugs . The guy that I used, you could give him a phone call or a text message from 4 p.m. onwards and within an hour -- I think his record was 10 minutes -- one of his drivers was sitting in a car outside the office. You'd just tell people you were popping down for a cigarette. You'd dive over into his car, he would just drive around the corner, and by the time you got out 30 seconds later, you've got cocaine and you've given him the money. He had four or five delivery points that were his favorite delivery points and they were all within walking distance of the office. And if your guy was busy or not answering, then you knew that someone else had a guy and they could get some off him. Of the hundred nights that I wanted to get cocaine, I think I can only...",

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- With Lionel Messi on the sidelines, Neymar took center stage in the battle with Cristiano Ronaldo for the crown of La Liga's most influential player on Saturday. Ronaldo's injury-time heroics prevented Real Madrid from falling eight points behind in the title race ahead of the international break, as the Portugal forward scored a last-gasp winner against Levante. Barcelona had no such problems, despite also going behind at home to Valladolid, with Gerardo Martino's team running out a 4-1 victor for eight wins out of eight. Alexis Sanchez scored two of those goals, but it was his fellow South American Neymar who ran the show -- scoring the last himself, setting up one for the Chilean and providing the spark for Xavi's strike that made it 2-1. With Messi recovering from a second injury this season, Neymar has been given an increasing amount of responsibility following his $75 million move from Santos and is showing he can fit into the role of team player as well as solo star. However, it was Sanchez who responded to Javi Guerra's 10th-minute opener, firing in a superb equalizer from outside the penalty area. Neymar's burst helped Cristian Tello to set up midfield veteran Xavi for his second goal this season, then the Brazilian slid a perfect pass for Sanchez to slot home in the 64th minute. The roles were reversed on 70 as Sanchez squared the ball to Neymar, who turned and fired in a low shot for his second league goal since arriving. Ronaldo took his La Liga tally to seven, one behind Messi and Atletico Madrid's Diego Costa, as he blasted the decisive goal in Real's 3-2 win at Levante. Real twice came from behind to deny the home side, which led through Baba Diawara in the 57th minute and then Nabil El Zhar with four to play in regulation. Captain Sergio Ramos leveled the first time, stabbing in at the far post from a corner, and 20-year-old substitute Alvaro Morata made it 2-2 before Ronaldo's deflected shot went in off the post in the fourth added minute. Coach Carlo Ancelotti had made several...",

Lat kha maung is performed before the matches as a kind of ritual that originated in farming villages. This is the way of Lethwei -- Myanmar's traditional form of boxing. Hidden from the rest of the world for decades, the sport, like Myanmar itself, is experiencing a revival and rediscovery both at home and abroad.

Bush was a \"uniter, not a divider,\" as he liked to say, but he did get all five living presidents together for the dedication of his presidential library. At Thursday's event in Dallas, Democratic former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton praised Bush for his initiatives in Africa, and Bush defended his record. \"The political winds blow left and right, polls rise and fall, supporters come and go, but in the end, leaders are defined by the convictions they hold,\" Bush said at the ceremony for the George W. Bush Presidential Center. \"My deepest conviction, the guiding principle of the administration, is that the United States of America must strive to expand the reach of freedom.\" Bush has said he is aware that the opening of his presidential library would reopen debates over the Iraq War and the policies he pursued after the September 11 terrorist attacks. History will show, he said at the dedication, that he always stuck by his convictions. \"A free society thrives when neighbors help neighbors and the strong protect the weak and public policies promote private compassion,\" Bush said. \"As president, I tried to act on these principles every day. It wasn't always easy and certainly wasn't always popular ... but when future generations come to this library to study this administration, they're going to find out that we stayed true to our convictions.\" Carter told a story of how he asked, on Bush's inauguration day, for a meeting to talk about a civil war in Sudan that was entering its second decade. Bush kept his word and acted, Carter said. \"In January of 2005, there was a peace treaty between north and south Sudan that ended a war that had been going on for 20 years,\" Carter said. \"George W.

Their AdTrap device intercepts online advertisements before they reach any devices that access your Internet connection, allowing you to surf the Web -- even stream videos -- without those annoying ads. Their inspiration? A conversation about the early days of the Internet. \"It was page, text and pictures -- and that's it,\" said Russell, 31. In other words, there were zero ads. So, Russell and Butkus set out to recreate the past and they came up with AdTrap. The company's motto is, \"The Internet is yours again.\" While there are countless software and browser plug-ins that block online advertisements -- many of them free -- they are limited to the individual device or the specific browser. AdTrap, a white rectangular box that resembles a wireless router and costs $139, intercepts the ads before they reach the laptop, tablet or mobile phone. Interest and enthusiasm for Russell and Butkus' idea translated into $200,000, raised through a 30-day Kickstarter crowdsourcing campaign earlier this year. The funds are being used by parent company Bluepoint Security, a mobile antivirus software firm, to manufacture the AdTrap units. \"I think it speaks to the mindset of people right now of their experience on the Internet,\" Russell said. AdTrap devices started shipping in August, so it's still a little early to get a thorough review of the product. At the company's modest Palo Alto headquarters, I tested one of the units, which take only a few minutes to set up. Compared to the various software ad-blockers, Russell said a hardware solution is more effective because it works on every device connected to your network. The unit sits between the modem and router and it works reasonably well. It was nice to go to YouTube and other websites, click on a video and have it play instantly, ad free. There are a couple of sites like Hulu, for instance where...",

That birdie blitz enabled the 2010 British Open champion to move three shots clear of world number one McIlroy, who hit 67, with Tiger Woods (68) tied for third with fellow American Dustin Johnson (65). \"Probably the start anyone would dream of on that front nine,\" said Oosthuizen, who once shot a round of 57 at a course near his birthplace of Mossel Bay, South Africa. \"I made everything, so you get those days where you just look at a putt and you hole it.\" Belgian rookie Colsaerts wins Ryder Cup wildcard .

The more I'm in the position on the back nine on Sunday, or in this case on a Monday, then it's going to happen sooner or later.

The photo would become one of the most iconic images of 1990s music: Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" album cover. Released on September 24, 1991, \"Nevermind\" catapulted the band and its music to the top of the charts, with songs including \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\"  giving birth to the Seattle-based grunge musical style. On the 20th anniversary of the album's release, Elden, the now-20-year-old son of an artist, said in jest  that now he suffers more tribulations than other famously photographed babies whose images are associated more with cuteness than grunge. \"When I am introduced, they introduce me as the Nirvana baby,\" said Elden. And because he was sans diaper when the famous shot was taken, there are other questions. \"They usually poke fun at me asking me, 'Is it the same size?'\" \"I always say, \"It's changed, do you want to see it?'\" Elden, also an artist, said he never met Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, whose looks and demeanor epitomized the '90s Generation-X subculture, a group and a mindset chronicled in films such as \"Slacker.\" \"Definitely, I like Nirvana a lot and there are no songs that I don't like -- they all have a special place for people,\" Elden said. Elden said he is not swimming in cash as a result of his baby celebrity status. His father, artist Rick Elden, agreed in 1991 to work on the cover with fellow photographer Kirk Weddle. He received no royalties for the job. \"My dad was an artist rigging special effects for Hollywood,\" said Elden. \"They went to the local pool, threw me in the water and that was it. It was a friend-helping-a-friend kind of thing.\" On Saturday, Elden said he celebrated the historic release of \"Nevermind\" with friends. \"We hung out ... and just listened to Nirvana music, drank beer and hung out.

The immigration debate is reflected in a number of policies and proposals, most recognizably state immigration laws that are being challenged. Oral arguments are scheduled at the Supreme Court on Wednesday as the justices decide whether Arizona can enforce its controversial immigration law. A bill in Mississippi that would require police to check the immigration status of all those arrested died in the state Senate this month. Amid the backdrop of contentious debates comes a study this week from the Pew Hispanic Center, which finds that for the first time in decades, the flow of Mexican migrants to and from the United States balances out. The effect may be even more pronounced. According to the report, \"the trend lines ... suggest that return flow to Mexico probably exceeded the inflow from Mexico during the past year or two.\" \"The largest wave of immigration in history from a single country to the United States has come to a standstill,\" the report announces. The report's findings weren't a surprise to several Mexican immigrants in Los Angeles, who said they've seen the political and economic situation shift dramatically in recent years. \"It isn't like it was before. The laws have changed. The work is very hard. Life is very expensive,\" said Norma Ibarra. \"It's not the United States it was 30 years ago.\" Alba Roche said her nieces in Mexico want to come to the United States, but can't. \"They haven't been able to come because of the situation, because there is not enough work, and more than anything because crossing is quite dangerous, so there are many obstacles,\" she said.

It's the annual White House correspondent's dinner. There's a red carpet, a presidential appearance, comedic relief and to make it all real, swanky after-parties. This year marks the 100th soiree, most of which have featured a fancy dinner and the president in attendance. In the early years, it was a small affair for 50. But in contemporary times, it has ballooned into a premier D.C. event at a huge hotel ballroom. CNN asked Julia Whiston, who serves as the dinner's executive director, when did it become such a mob scene, and why? \"Coincidentally, when I first started,\" she said and paused for effect, with a chuckle. It happened in 1993, she said. \"But it was because it was Bill Clinton's first dinner. They had a very large Hollywood following, and they wanted to be at the dinner.\" The President tells jokes, a famous entertainer tells jokes, and reporters are called to the dais to collect awards.

Dr. Keith Van Haren, a pediatric neurologist at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, has written a report about five of the early cases. In that report, which will be presented in April at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting, neurologists said they had identified five patients who developed paralysis in one or more of their limbs between August 2012 and July 2013. All five children had been vaccinated against the poliovirus. Treatment did not seem to help the children regain their motor function. Samples from two of those children tested positive for enterovirus 68, a rare virus that has been linked to severe respiratory illness in the past. Samples from the other three children were not collected or tested soon enough to yield conclusive results, said Dr. Emmanuelle Waubant, a neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco. \"About 20 cases have been identified in the U.S. so far, all in California, and all occurring in the past 18 months,\" Van Haren said in an online posting Monday on the hospital's website. Sofia Jarvis is one of the children affected. Her mother, Jessica Tomei, told reporters Monday night the family is speaking out to raise awareness of the condition.

Yanukovych went on sick leave on Thursday with \"acute respiratory disease,\" his office said. He is now feeling \"good\" after treatment and his condition has been assessed as \"satisfactory,\" a statement on the presidential website said. Ukraine has been plunged into a deep political crisis that in the last week saw the Prime Minister and Cabinet resign, a controversial anti-protest law repealed, and the President signing off on a contested amnesty bill for anti-government protesters. Thousands of demonstrators have packed Kiev's Independence Square since November, when Yanukovych reversed a decision to sign a long-awaited trade deal with the European Union and turned instead toward Russia. The government's attempts to crack down on protests appear only to have strengthened the opposition's resolve. Violent confrontations flared after a sweeping anti-protest law was signed two weeks ago, followed by an uneasy standoff on the streets as the battle in the political arena has heated up. On Sunday, the demonstrators showed no signs of leaving, again massing in Independence Square despite freezing temperatures. Amnesty bill .

From medieval cathedrals to Calatrava's futuristic City of Arts and Sciences, Valancia packs in plenty. Where else could you glimpse the Holy Grail in the morning, gorge on paella on a Mediterranean beach for lunch and then wander along a old river bed transformed into a park and visit architectural blockbusters that look like a Star Trek vision of a colonized planet? After an early morning shot of coffee and, depending on your sugar tolerance, churros, the Cathedral in the heart of the old city is the best place to start the day. Located on the Plaza de la Reina, the cathedral is an impressive mix of gothic, baroque and Romanesque architectural styles. As striking as the many parts of the cathedral are, the sight of the Holy Grail my leave you underwhelmed -- to the unenlightened it resembles something closer to a plastic mug circa. 1973. If you're in town on a Thursday, catch the enactment of a tradition almost as old as the grail. The Tribunal de las Aguas, or Water Court, is the meeting of the city's elders, who gather outside the cathedral's Plaza del Palau for around twenty minutes. It generally involves a number of old men sitting down not doing very much, while one pronounces what has been decided, and it's a bit of a tour-group hot spot. On the other side of the plaza is the octagonal Miguelte Bell Tower, where you can climb 207 steps for a panoramic view of the low-rise old city. Not far through the old city's happy tangle of narrow streets is the Lonja: a fifteenth-century trading house, studded with a fine collection of mugging gargoyles now preserved under UNESCO Heritage status. Bringing yourself out of the city's medieval landmarks, you can feast on modern culture at IVAM, the city's cheap and excellent modern art gallery.

Self-help author James Arthur Ray has hired investigators to investigate two deaths at an Arizona sweat lodge. Authorities said James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Kirby Brown, 38,  of Westtown, New York, died Friday at the Angel Valley Resort after spending up to two hours in the sauna-like sweat lodge. Nineteen others were treated for injuries. One person remained hospitalized Thursday in critical condition, Waugh said. The dead and injured were attending a program by self-help author James Arthur Ray, authorities said. A search warrant was executed Wednesday at the James Ray International offices in Carlsbad, California, the sheriff said. Authorities were attempting to determine whether documents exist on how to construct sweat lodges and on their proper use, as well as documents showing whether participants were advised of the risks of sweat lodges either before or during the program. They also were searching for rosters from past events, Waugh said. Police would not say what, if anything, was found in executing the search warrant.

            "Washington (CNN) -- Jordan's King Abdullah met Tuesday with U.S. President Barack Obama to discuss the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the conflict in Syria, which borders Jordan. The two leaders told reporters after their White House talks that they would continue working together to bring about a resumption of Middle East peace talks, with King Abdullah citing the need to \"keep our fingers crossed\" for progress. In recent months, King Abdullah has taken a more active role in trying to bridge the gulf between Israelis and Palestinians, filling the vacuum created by the removal of Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak. Earlier this month, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met in Amman with representatives of the Middle East Quartet -- made up of the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia -- in an effort to relaunch negotiations after more than a year of deadlock. No significant breakthrough was made, but the two sides agreed to meet again. Obama said Tuesday he wanted to express his appreciation for the monarch's leadership in the region amid the change of what is known as the Arab Spring that has toppled governments in Egypt and Libya. On Syria, Obama noted that King Abdullah was the first leader of an Arab state to call on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down over excess brutality against his own people. Obama thanked the king \"for his willingness to stand up,\" and for Jordan's role in Arab League efforts to encourage a needed peaceful transition in Syria. \"Unfortunately, we're continuing to see unacceptable levels of violence inside that country, and so we will continue to consult very closely with Jordan to create the kind of international pressure and environment that encourages the current Syrian regime to step aside so that a more democratic process of transition can take place inside of Syria,\" he said. In addition, Obama noted what he called the \"extraordinary efforts that have been made by his majesty\" and Jordan's prime minister \"in guiding political reform in..."

        "Extract key points from the article based on which the stock market could react:\n\n(CNN) -- Samsung's flagship smartphone could be getting twice as fast. The South Korean electronics company plans to release a quicker version of the Galaxy S4, says CEO J.K. Shin. He told Reuters it will be for sale in South Korea later this month. The phones, which will be powered by a new Qualcomm processor, use what's being called LTE-advanced technology, which will reportedly deliver data at speeds up to twice those of current 4G LTE connections. Some downloads could be even quicker. A movie that takes three minutes to download on the current Galaxy S4 would take one minute on the new phone, Samsung told Reuters . Shin said Samsung is in talks with carriers in other countries about the phone. He did not specify which countries, or carriers. The Galaxy S4 has been Samsung's most popular smartphone yet. It passed 10 million sales in its first month -- a clip that outpaced its predecessor, the S3, which emerged as the Android system's most successful rival to the iPhone. Recently, though, both Apple and Samsung have seen a slowdown in sales of top-end smartphones, as that market has shown signs of becoming saturated. An even faster S4, obviously, would be an effort to appeal to that upper-tier buyer who's willing to fork over cash for the fanciest and fastest new models. Shin told Reuters the new model would be \"slightly more expensive\" than the current S4, which sells for $199 and up, depending on the carrier and which service plan the customer signs up for. Last month, Samsung announced that it will be making a smaller version of the S4. That phone will be unveiled at an event Thursday. There also have been unconfirmed reports that Apple will release a cheaper version of its iPhone. As the high-end market tightens up, Apple, Samsung and other phone makers are eyeing developing countries, where interest in smartphones is still growing.",

            "Accra, Ghana (CNN) -- A U.S. Peace Corps volunteer in northern Ghana stabbed and killed a suspected robber, the police officer investigating the case said Monday. The volunteer, identified by the Ghanaian officer as 26-year-old Andrew Kristler, was with another Peace Corps volunteer early Saturday morning in Wa, the capital of the Upper West Region. They were accosted by two alleged assailants, according to the officer, who was not authorized to speak on the record. A struggle ensued and Kristler stabbed one of the assailants in the chest, killing him, the officer said. The volunteer sustained wounds to his shoulder and hand. Police discovered the body of the alleged assailant early Saturday morning; the other attacker remains at large. Following drops of blood from the body, police were led to Kristler, the officer said. By way of explanation for why he hadn't reported to the incident to police promptly, the volunteer allegedly told authorities he had been advised by the U.S. Embassy in Accra to stay indoors, the officer said. That account was disputed by Mike Koffman, the country director of Peace Corps in Ghana. He said Kristler reported the incident. U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell weighed in on what happened Monday. \"We can confirm that two Peace Corps volunteers in Ghana were the victims of a crime in the early hours of Saturday, July 14. Contrary to media reports, they are not being detained at this time. The matter is under investigation by Ghanaian officials. We are closely monitoring the situation and are providing consular assistance,\" he said. According to the investigating officer in Ghana, Kristler is required to check back in with police next week. Nearly 5,000 Peace Corps volunteers have served in Ghana since 1961, according to the program's website."

Challenges are likely to come quickly for the new head of the AU as she deals with the aftermath of recent coups in Guinea Bissau and Mali. Ping was criticized as being slow and ineffective in his response to last year's coup in Cote D'Ivoire and the revolution in Libya.

As the plane approached Newark International Airport at around midnight Sunday, the crew of Continental Flight 1915 asked air traffic controllers if the building was still lit up. After confirming it was, a controller put the plane on a course down New York's Hudson River, telling the pilot they could see the west side of the skyscraper. \"We got 200 people looking at it,\" the crew of the Boeing 767 responded. \"Really pretty night for it, too.\" \"I planned that,\" the air traffic controller deadpanned. A string of air traffic controllers -- neutral on most occasions, partisan on this one -- chimed in as the plane landed and taxied, proclaiming, \"Go Jets!\" The radio traffic was recorded and placed on LiveATC.net, a website for aviation hobbyists and devotees. The Jets beat the favored New England Patriots 28-21 Sunday in a National Football League playoff game, a result that evidently lightened the mood on board the Continental Boeing 767. \"You've got a happy bunch on board, huh?\" a controller says in the first transmission on the tape. \"Very happy,\" the pilot or first officer says. \"We have a question for you: Is the Empire State Building still lit up right now?...

            "(CNN) -- Facebook seems to be taking a beating these days. But guess what? That's actually good news. The world's most famous social media company's plummeting share price (from $38 on its first trading day to $19 today) is an indicator that we are not in a bubble, as investors refuse to buy into the temptation to blow tech offerings out of proportion. You know you are in a bubble when stocks soar regardless of intrinsic quality. Far from it, the current market is one of Dickensian realism: the best of times and the worst of times. Apple's value has soared because it has a clear and wildly profitable strategy. Facebook, Groupon and Zynga sank because their strategies are unconvincing. Put another way, companies with solid revenue models are richly rewarded while companies foolish enough to go public before proving their model are punished. It's worth noting the companies that have not gone public. Unlike Facebook, Twitter remains private while it continues to refine its business model. Enterprise social network company Yammer sold itself to Microsoft because its founders realized that a sale was the only way to get the resources needed for growth without the risks and distractions inherent in going public. Facebook's wounds are self-inflicted. The company did a poor job of managing its investor growth and was forced to go public because of Securities and Exchange Commission rules governing companies with assets of more than $1 billion and more than 500 shareholders. Facebook compounded its misery by setting its IPO price too high and offering too many shares. Imagine telling Facebook underwriters and founder Mark Zuckerberg: \"You can either sell a lot of shares at a lower price or fewer shares at a higher price. Make a choice.\" Apparently the answer was: \"We'll take both.\" The consequence was more shares, and more expensive shares, than the market could absorb. Facebook thought that user popularity would translate to investor appeal and counted on its members to buy shares in the IPO. This is what is known as..."

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- London 2012 organizers could argue that one of the many attractions of holding the Olympics in the British capital is the number of great restaurants on offer for visitors harboring a hunger for tasty morsels. But gastronomy does not always entail gluttony. Eating the right food is vital to your health -- especially for the thousands of athletes who will be heading to the Olympic Park for the July 27-August 12 sporting showpiece. Team CNN's Zain Verjee traveled to Michelin-starred Danesfield House, on the outskirts of the city, with former British 400 meters runner Katharine Merry to help prepare a nutritious three-course meal that the Sydney 2000 Olympics bronze medalist described as: \"Nice and light. Like a pre-competition meal you would have the night before.\" The first course delivered a simple blend of fruit tastes from England, strawberries being the berry of choice in July. But crucially it also delivered a hit of protein from the natural yoghurt and milk and a burst of energy via the natural fructose and xylitol. Nutritionist James Collins, an adviser for Team Great Britain during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, agreed that fruit smoothies were the perfect snack for training athletes. \"As a sprinter you need to make sure the protein intake is high enough to support muscle recovery. Things like meats and other dairy products are great for this,\" the director of London company Performance Nutrition told CNN. \"Berries and other fruits are full of antioxidants. They help athletes get rid of free-radicals, helping the muscles to be less sore the next day. \"Smoothies with milk or yoghurt are also a good source of calcium. A lot of athletes have high-impact workout sessions so they need a high calcium intake to make sure their bones are strong.\" Merry, who retired in 2005 after injuries stopped her following up her medal achievement, now works as a television pundit. \"Smoothies are a good start to the day,\" the 37-year-old said. \"They can be very filling. Just an extra oomph of protein powder mixed into...",

In long days scheduled in 15-minute increments, presidents are asked to make decisions affecting millions -- sometimes life-or-death decisions. \"When you get to the Oval Office, there are no easy decisions,\" says Kenneth Duberstein, who was chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan. \"Any decision that reaches the president's desk is a close call. It's not black and white.

It wrapped up a 7-6 (9-7) 6-7 (11-13) 7-5 victory for the American top seed after Sunday's epic battle with his 20-year-old opponent, which lasted two hours 26 minutes. \"That's the best shot I've ever hit in my life, considering the circumstance,\" Roddick told the official ATP Tour website. \"He had a great volley there. I don't really remember much else besides the fact that I went for the ball. I hit it. I didn't really think much of it. Then I heard people cheering. I was like, 'No, there's no way that went in.' \" Raonic, who came to prominence by claiming the ATP title in San Jose last week as a wildcard entry, pushed the world number eight to the limit, leveling the match when he won a marathon second-set tiebreak. His big serving eclipsed even Roddick, pummeling down 32 aces to take his tally for the week to 129 -- comfortably a new tournament record. Mark Philippoussis set the previous best total of 106 in 2001. But Roddick's full-stretch winner on match-point in the 12th game of the decider gave him his 30th career title from 50 finals and his third victory in Memphis. \"I think I was very fortunate,\" Roddick added. \"I feel like I got outplayed. I just stuck around and kept trying. \"He's as exciting a talent as we have seen in a while.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday released five photographs of a man carefully edited from four videos in which the man sexually assaults a young girl, believed to be 7 to 9 years old. Three of the videos, which contain a clear image of the man, are date-stamped April 14, a fourth is dated April 27, and all four appear to have been posted on the Internet several days later, on May 2. Danish National Police discovered the videos soon thereafter and notified U.S. authorities on May 3. Three factors led Danish investigators to believe the crime occurred in the U.S.: the background, some products visible in the video, and the man's appearance. In the United States, investigators with Homeland Security Investigations, the law enforcement arm of ICE, saw a Frito-Lay Rold Gold bag for thin pretzels in the videos. By studying Frito-Lay web sites, they learned that Rold Gold pretzels are packaged differently within the United States and Canada. ICE investigators believe the bag in the video is exclusively distributed in the United States. With leads coming to an end, the investigators are asking the public for help in identifying the man. \"We kind of hit a wall in this investigation. Without the public's help, we may not be able (to find the man) and more importantly stop the ongoing abuse of this victim,\" said Brian Korzak, a special agent with ICE's Cyber Crimes Center, Child Exploitation Unit. Publication of the man's photo \"will greatly increase our chances of locating this individual,\" said Special Agent Patrick Redling. \"Since the videos were created so recently, we feel there's a child in danger right now.\" Korzak and Redling say investigators routinely identify both technical and visual clues in videos for evidence to identify criminals and to...",

Obama's hat tip to Ohio, and his choice of venue, may not be pure coincidence -- Ohio is historically a key swing state in presidential elections. Cameron and Obama flew together on Air Force One to Dayton, Ohio, to take in an opening game of the NCAA basketball tournament. Obama, well-known as a basketball fan, was treating Cameron to a little March Madness, and the pair conducted the joint television interview at halftime of the game between Western Kentucky and Mississippi Valley State. Asked how he thought the teams were playing, Obama replied candidly. \"Both teams are shooting terribly,\" Obama said. \"It may be nerves. These are not teams that normally end up coming to the tournament.\" Cameron, asked how he was enjoying watching his first basketball game, said he was \"enjoying it,\" and that Obama was explaining the ins-and-outs of the American sport. \"He was giving me some tips,\" Cameron said. \"He's going to help me fill out my bracket.\" Cameron's trip to the United States is intended to demonstrate that ties between the countries remain as close as ever.

Teams based in Mumbai, Bangkok, Singapore and Dubai will contest the event from November 27-December 14 later this year with 24 matches taking place across the four host cities. Spain's Nadal was picked for Mumbai, who also include 14-time grand slam legend Pete Sampras, while his WTA Tour counterpart Williams is in the Singapore line-up. Novak Djokovic will feature for Dubai, with Wimbledon champion Andy Murray representing Bangkok. The event is the brainchild of Indian doubles star Mahesh Bhupathi and the concept is modeled on cricket's Indian Premier League. A total sum of $23,975,000 was spent across the four teams, with Bhupathi delighted to have attracted a clutch of current and former champions. \"We've got some unbelievably strong teams. I think out of the 28 players that got drafted we have about 21 Grand Slam champions. We have 14 present and past number ones. It's a pretty blockbuster field,\" Bhupathi said. The dates are during the off-season for both the ATP and WTA Tour, but there are some notable absentees with both Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova sitting it out. Australian Open champion Li Na is also missing despite her popularity in Asia and her male counterpart Stanislas Wawrinka has joined fellow Swiss star Federer on the sidelines. The matches will be in best-of-five format with single set contests in men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, mixed doubles and past champions singles. The schedule will see matches in Singapore, followed by Bangkok and Mumbai with the finale in Dubai.",

        "Sum the following article in brief: Iran, South Korea and Australia all booked a place in next year's FIFA World Cup following a dramatic final round of group matches in the Asian qualifying competition. A second-half goal from Reza Ghoochannejhad was enough for Iran to beat South Korea 1-0 in Ulsan, meaning Carlos Queiroz's team finished top of Group A. Victory saw Iran reach football's premier competition for the fourth time in its history, having previously played in the first round of the 1978, 1998 and 2006 tournaments. CNN correspondent Shirzad Bozorgmehr said Iranians took to the streets across their country to celebrate. He said that cars in the capital Tehran were draped in the Iranian flag and blowing their horns as their passengers shouted \"Iran, Iran.\" \"This is the second national celebration in Iran in the last five days,\" said Bozorgmehr. \"Following the landslide victory of Dr. Hassan Rohani last Friday in the presidential elections, huge crowds poured into the streets of Tehran and other cities to publicly celebrate Dr Rohani's election victory.\" In his first press conference on Monday, Rohani told reporters he planned to overhaul sports in a country where soccer is the most popular game. Despite defeat, South Korea still clinched the second automatic qualification spot as Uzbekistan fell agonizingly short against Qatar, winning 5-1 but finishing third in Group A on goal difference alone. After the match, South Korea coach Choi Kang-Hee revealed that he would be stepping down from his post - a surprise move at first glance, although Choi did say he would only take charge for the qualifiers when appointed in December 2011. Choi had been involved in an acrimonious war of words with Iran coach Carlos Quieroz ahead of the game and home fans hurled plastic water bottles and other items onto the pitch after taking offense at a gesture directed towards Choi by the Portuguese after the match. South Korea's loss meant Uzbekistan would qualify for the finals for the first time if it beat Qatar by six goals. But Uzbekistan fell behind in...",

After years of manufacturing delays and cost overruns, the state-of-the-art Boeing 787 Dreamliner makes its North American debut Sunday morning, toting more than 200 eager United Airlines passengers from Houston to Chicago. It promises to be a morning full of festivities, starting with a ribbon-cutting before the plane departs Bush Intercontinental Airport at 7:20 a.m. The aircraft touches down two and a half hours later at O'Hare International Airport, greeted by a water cannon salute. United says the 787 -- the airline has ordered 50 -- will \"revolutionize the flying experience for our customers and crew while delivering unprecedented operating efficiency, comfort and lower emissions.\" The Dreamliner saves airlines money on fuel because its body is made from lightweight composite materials. It features passenger comforts such as bigger windows, larger overhead bins and better ventilation. U.S. routes announced for 'sports car in the sky' Sunday's flight crew won't need to kick the nose gear tires, size 40x16.0 R16/26PR to be exact, before taking off. United received the Dreamliner flying Sunday on September 28. It was put through the paces in October before earning Federal Aviation Administration certification. \"Everyone's very excited, even people who aren't in the industry,\" Phil Derner, founder of the aviation news site NYCAviation.com, told CNN in August. \"There's a ton of new technology on the 787. It's efficient and performs well, and it's also a very good-looking aircraft. It's kind of like a sports car in the sky.\" In September 2011, Japan's All Nippon Airways became the first carrier to receive the plane, which was three years overdue at that time.

Prolific striker Samuel Eto'o is on the verge of moving to Serie A with Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan. The Cameroon international will reportedly sign a five-year contract worth almost $15 million per season. Spanish champions Barcelona have already agreed a deal to swap Eto'o for Inter's star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic plus $74 million and the loan of Nou Camp fringe player Aleksander Hleb.

The deal's sealed, next week he will start working with Inter. \"As soon as he signs the contract he will be at Mourinho's disposal.\" Eto'o is poised to end what has recently been an acrimonious five-year stay in the Catalan capital. He was the club's top scorer last season with 34 goals, but annoyed the club while being courted by English club Manchester City, leading coach Pep Guardiola to state that it would be best for the club if the player left despite him having been offered a new contract.

In retreat: the roof of the world is experiencing rapid summer melting. The result of this deglaciation could be conflict as Himalayan glacial runoff has an essential role in the economies, agriculture and even religions of the regions countries. The Himalayan glaciers form the world's largest ice body outside of the polar caps. Popularly known as the \"Water Tower of Asia,\" they are the source of water for rivers that flow across the continent: the Indus River in Pakistan, the Brahmaputra that flows through Bangladesh, the Mekong that descends through Southeast Asia, the Irrawaddy in Myanmar, the Yellow and Yangtze rivers of China and a multitude of smaller rivers that flow through the Indo-Gangetic plains of Northern India. Satellite data from the Indian Space Applications Center, in Ahmedabad, India, indicates that from 1962 to 2004, more than 1,000 Himalayan glaciers have retreated by around 16 percent.

            "(CNN) -- The challenge facing the next generation of the Chinese leadership is steering the nation as it moves from an export and investment driven economy to a more sustainable consumption-driven economy. However, such transformation will not be easy. Over the last two decades, various measures to encourage Chinese consumption had limited success. The expansion of higher education since mid-1990s was one early attempt. While a success in matriculation -- 19% of Chinese under the age of 30 have a college degrees -- the move failed to spur consumption as families instead saved to afford university educations. A similar story can be seen in the commercialization of the housing market. Families have to save increasingly more in order to afford apartments with rising prices. Given the spotty success of Beijing policy to boost consumption, new research suggests the key may lie in tackling China's growing divide between the rich and the poor. Read more: Why China needs to learn the three R's . The government has never publicly released household-level data necessary to study this problem. To gauge the scope of the problem, my colleagues and I at China Household Finance Survey conducted a nationwide survey, interviewing a random sample of 8,438 households in China, both rural and urban. We found that the top 10% of Chinese households garnered 57% of total income and 85% of total assets -- a concentration level of income and wealth that surpasses those of developed countries, and can only be found in some of the African countries such as South Africa and Seychelles. Income inequality is the key reason for China's low consumption rate. The rich hold the vast majority of Chinese savings. The top 10% of households have 69% of the total savings, and average saving rate for these households is a staggering 60%. Conversely, about half of the Chinese households surveyed have negligible savings. Therein lies the dilemma for Beijing's new leaders as they try to make Chinese consumers, not exports, the key driver of China's..."

Randy Phillips' e-mail could contradict his earlier testimony that he had no idea Jackson was getting prescription drugs while he was preparing for his comeback concerts. Phillips is on the witness stand for a fifth day Tuesday in the Jackson wrongful death trial, which is in its seventh week. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos sent jurors out of the courtroom at one point Monday afternoon so she could lecture Phillips about arguing with Jackson lawyer Brian Panish and appearing to evade his questions. \"Arguing with the lawyers is not going to help,\" Palazuelos told Phillips. \"It's not going to help your case. It's not going to help anybody. It's lengthening your testimony. \" Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, saying the concert promoter is liable in Jackson's death because it hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter.

Jackson, not AEG Live, chose and controlled Murray, company lawyers argue. Although they negotiated a contract to pay Murray $150,000 a month to attend to Jackson, it was never fully executed because Jackson died before they signed, they say. AEG executives -- including Co-CEO Paul Gongaware, who had managed Jackson's last two tours -- had no way of knowing that Jackson was abusing drugs, especially the surgical anesthetic propofol, which the coroner ruled played the largest role in his death, AEG Live lawyers argue.

The LCC also called on Syrians to make Monday a day a remembrance. \"Please join us in observing a moment of silence as we remember the sacrifices of our fallen heroes, whose pure blood has saturated the earth of our beloved country,\" it said. Earlier, another opposition activist group, the Syrian Revolution General Council, said as many as 34 people had died Sunday, including a person who had been killed under torture, a woman and two children. Heavy clashes took place in the Eastern Ghouta area outside Damascus, the LCC said.

LaGuardia Airport's Central Terminal is being treated as a crime scene. Scott McGann, 32, appeared in court after authorities said he walked into LaGuardia's Central Terminal Saturday morning with what was determined to be a fake bomb. The terminal was reopened after several hours. Queens District Attorney Richard A.

McGann appeared in court Saturday, but his arraignment was postponed, Brown said. McGann is being held without bail. \"The defendant is clearly a very troubled young man,\" Brown said. \"As a result, the Court has directed that he be examined to determine whether he has the capacity to understand the proceedings against him and assist in his defense.\" Earlier, officials said McGann wouldn't speak to his lawyer or anyone else. His next court appearance is scheduled for Thursday. McGann allegedly arrived at a checkpoint in the terminal at about 4:50 a.m., carrying a backpack and refusing to answer security questions. Authorities said the officer at the checkpoint was informed that a suspicious package was attached to the bottom of McGann's backpack, and that McGann allegedly grabbed what appeared to be a trigger device with a red button connected to the backpack. McGann allegedly pressed the button several times before a Port Authority officer grabbed the trigger and the package away from him. The package turned out to be a device consisting of batteries, cylinders and electronic components that could have been used to make a bomb, Brown said, but the bomb squad found that it didn't not contain any explosives.

Bowe Bergdahl without giving Congress the appropriate notice, Congress' independent investigative arm announced Thursday. Susan Poling, general counsel for the U.S. Government Accountability Office, wrote in a letter to nine Republican senators that the Pentagon should have notified \"the relevant congressional committees at least 30 days in advance of the transfer.\" Moreover, Poling noted that the GAO also concluded the Defense Department broke the law by using \"appropriated funds to carry out the transfer when no money was available for that purpose.\" Poling noted that her office wasn't weighing in on Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel's decision to carry out the prisoner swap, but rather his \"responsibility to comply with a notification condition on the availability of appropriations to transfer individuals from Guantanamo Bay.\" Talking to CNN on Thursday evening, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby noted Hagel's previous admission \"that we probably could have done a better job keeping Congress informed. Absolutely.\" But that doesn't mean the Defense Department did anything illegal, Kirby said. He stated officials felt they had \"to move quickly\" out of concern for Bergdahl's life. The Pentagon said that President Barack Obama's administration felt \"it was necessary and appropriate to forgo 30 days' notice\" to do so. \"We ... believe that it was lawfully done, lawfully conducted,\" Kirby said of the exchange. \"And this was a judgment that was shared by the Justice Department.\" Poling's letter was in response to a June 13 request from the GOP senators for her opinion on the matter. Captured in Afghanistan early in the summer of 2009, Bergdahl was freed almost five years later in exchange for five men who were being held at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

They say the new measures will feature additional random checks after passengers make it through security and will include passenger pat-downs, bag checks and hand swabs for traces of explosives. The new issue of AQAP's Inspire magazine, released on December 24, featured instructions on how to build what AQAP called a \"hidden bomb\" from easily purchasable materials. It also included directions on how would-be lone wolves worldwide can evade airport security scanners and sniffer dogs. In recent months, AQAP's leadership has repeatedly stated hitting the United States is a priority. The new issue of Inspire made clear it viewed lone wolf attacks by its supporters in the West as an increasingly important part of these efforts. The magazine claimed the recipe was for a simplified version of the device used in an attempt to blow up a U.S. passenger jet over Detroit five years ago. On Christmas Day 2009, Omar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called \"underwear bomber,\" attempted to detonate an explosive device built by Ibrahim al Asiri, AQAP's master bomb-maker, on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. The main charge -- a white powdery explosive called PETN which airport security scanners at Amsterdam airport did not detect -- failed to detonate as the plane approached Detroit. The new recipe does not involve the manufacture of PETN, a substance difficult for extremists to manufacture or obtain in the West. Instead, it contains similarities to a bomb formula put out by the group in the first issue of Inspire in 2010 called \"Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom.\" That recipe was downloaded and used by the Boston bombers and several other extremists in plots on both sides of the Atlantic.

            "(CNN) -- Mercedes domination of the Formula One season came to a shuddering halt in final qualifying for the Austrian Grand Prix Saturday as Brazilian veteran Felipe Massa took pole position. Massa held off Williams teammate Valtteri Bottas of Finland with championship leader Nico Rosberg only third for Mercedes. Rosberg's teammate Lewis Hamilton fared worse, having to settle for ninth fastest on an afternoon of upsets. Hamilton, 22 points behind Rosberg in the title race after failing to finish in the previous round in Montreal, had his first effort in the last session of qualifying ruled out for running wide on the circuit then spun on the second. It was the 33-year-old Massa who adapted best to the twisting circuit at Spielberg, which is being used to host the first Austrian Grand Prix since Michael Schumacher won in 2003. His time of one minute 8.579 seconds gave him his 16th career F1 pole and deprived Rosberg of his third straight pole. \"I'm so happy with what's happened today with us, our team. It's such a great moment. It's been a long time since I had my last pole position, which was in Brazil in 2008,\" Massa said. Mercedes, with Williams pressing them, had dominated the three practice sessions ahead of qualifying so Rosberg was surprised to trail when it mattered. \"I definitely didn't expect Williams to be ahead of me today but they did a good job,\" the German said. \"I will do my best. It was a strong performance (from Massa and Bottas) but I think I can be faster in the race. So we'll see... I think I have good chances,\" he added. It was a disappointing afternoon for Red Bull after Daniel Ricciardo's victory in Canada where both Rosberg and Hamilton suffered technical problems. Ricciardo eventually finished fifth -- just behind Ferrari's Fernando Alonso -- but four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel failed to even make the final session and had to settle for 13th fastest. The hiccup in Montreal aside, where Rosberg still managed second place, Mercedes had enjoyed a near perfect season heading..."

An Iraqi woman walks past a car damaged in the September 16 incident involving Blackwater. Its sponsor, North Carolina Democratic Rep. David Price, said the bill would clear up questions such as those raised by last month's Baghdad shootings involving contractors from the U.S. security firm Blackwater USA. Price introduced the measure in January, and the Judiciary Committee approved the bill in August. The House of Representatives was expected to begin debate on the bill Wednesday afternoon, with a vote tentatively scheduled Thursday morning. But the White House, in a formal statement of policy, said the measure would overburden the military, overstretch the FBI, intrude on prosecutorial decisions and extend federal jurisdiction overseas in ways that would be \"impossible or unwise.\" \"The administration welcomes the opportunity to discuss these important issues further with Congress,\" the statement said. The bill would state that contractors working for the U.S. government overseas are subject to the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, which allows American courts to prosecute crimes committed in a war zone overseas. The act covers contractors \"supporting the mission of the Department of Defense.\" But Blackwater is providing security to Department of State officials. Wednesday, Price released a statement calling the Bush administration's objections unfounded. The White House position \"should infuriate anyone who believes in the rule of law,\" the statement read. \"The fact is the administration has an embarrassing track record for investigating and prosecuting misconduct by contractors working in our name. \"This is precisely why we need to clarify the scope of the law and put FBI resources on the ground.\" Foreign service analyst Peter Singer of the Brookings Institute --...",

Mary Harvey posted a series of videos on YouTube last month about the breakup of the couple's marriage and the bitter fight that followed. She alleged that following their 2005 divorce, Harvey \"turned my son against me, had me evicted from our house, thrown out, all the businesses, all the money, the cars ... He manipulated the courts, everything against me.\" Steve Harvey could not respond at the time because of a gag order in the case, said attorney Bobbie Edmonds. But Edmonds released a statement Tuesday saying the judge had temporarily lifted the order so Harvey could respond. Some of the documents released Tuesday are redacted, but they say the court found that Mary Harvey: . -- \"was not homeless or evicted from her home and was awarded three homes in the property settlement;\" -- that Harvey \"did not take, withhold or turn the child against Mary Lee Harvey;\" -- that Mary Harvey \"willingly placed the child on an airplane and sent him to Mr. Harvey without his knowledge;\" -- and that Harvey has primary custody of the 13-year-old. In addition, the court documents said, Mary Harvey received $40,000 a month from Harvey until March 2009 and received $1.5 million from him in March 2009. In the series of videos, Mary Harvey included excerpts of letters and e-mails she said she intercepted between Harvey and his current wife, Marjorie, near the end of her 16-year relationship with him. She said on their second wedding anniversary, \"it hit me really hard\" when she intercepted a love letter from a mistress -- the woman he would later move in with and marry.

To help get you motivated, we've identified 10 destinations that are sure to make headlines in 2015. Some will host major global events, while others will celebrate anniversaries, unveil new attractions or stand in Mother Nature's spotlight. The Bahamian Riviera . With four hotels, 200,000 square feet of convention space, a 2,000-seat performing arts center, 18-hole Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course, 30 restaurants and bars, 14 distinct pools and a 100,000-square-foot casino large enough to rival any in Las Vegas or Macau, the $3.5 billion development known as Baha Mar is kind of a big deal. In fact, the so-called \"Bahamian Riviera\" is the largest single-phase luxury resort project in the history of the Caribbean and the most substantial currently in development in the Western Hemisphere. Located along Nassau's famed Cable Beach, Baha Mar is expected to send ripples across the Caribbean when it opens to the public in late spring 2015 with a grand gala produced by music and entertainment legends Jamie King and Emilio Estefan. The event is meant to herald the arrival of a new Riviera -- one full of 21st-century entertainment located right in Florida's backyard. Mons, Belgium . Mons, Belgium, has a population of just 93,072 people, but the small city expects 2 million visitors to ply its medieval streets when it hosts more than 1,000 cultural and artistic events in 2015 as the offical European Capital of Culture. Highlights of the yearlong celebration include an illuminating new Van Gogh exhibit, three multidisciplinary arts festivals, numerous public installations and art-infused parties. Moreover, Mons will unveil not one, not two, but an astounding five new museums in April, including The Artotheque (art library) and Mons Memorial Museum. Think of 2015 as a coming out party for this former mining and industrial center that's completely reinventing itself. Downtown Los Angeles .

        "Sum the following article in brief: The U.S. Capitol was briefly evacuated Saturday afternoon when a small aircraft entered restricted airspace, authorities said. The evacuation was ordered after authorities were unable to immediately contact the pilot, U.S. Capitol Police said. NORAD says two F-16 fighter jets intercepted the plane around 1:30 p.m. after it entered restricted airspace and was out of communication with air traffic control. The jets escorted the plane to the airport in Mount Airy, North Carolina, where the pilot was met by members of law enforcement. A U.S. official told CNN that the pilot's destination was Mount Airy, where he was going to meet his daughter.  The source says the pilot said his outdated maps caused him some confusion. There was one other person in plane. No security issues, just a pilot deviation, Ross Feinstein, the Press Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration, tweeted. Staff and visitors were allowed back inside the Capitol after about a half hour. Also evacuated during the scare was the Library of Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court buildings, the Metropolitan Police said. Federal Aviation Administration officials told CNN there will be an investigation into why the pilot entered the restricted airspace without authorization. The incident prompted authorities to institute an AIRCON RED -- air condition red -- alert, police told CNN. The alert is triggered when an aircraft enters restricted airspace in Washington without authorization. Visitors to Washington got unexpected excitement. \"We were touring around in one of the rooms in the Capitol,\" said Victoria Chandler. \"And the tour guide all of a sudden got very frantic and started telling us to evacuate the building and go down the steps. \"I grabbed two of the youngest girls and my mother got me and we started running down the stairs.

        "Sum the following article in brief: (Health.com) -- The small fraction of women who choose intrauterine devices (IUDs) or under-skin implants as their preferred method of birth control may be on to something: According to a new study, these long-acting forms of contraception are 20 times better at preventing unintended pregnancies than the Pill and other short-term methods. The study, published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine, compared the effectiveness of various types of birth control in a group of about 7,500 sexually active women in the St. Louis area. Over a period of three years, 9.4% of women using birth control pills, patches, or vaginal rings became pregnant accidentally, compared to just 0.9% of women who opted for IUDs or implants. The difference in these so-called contraceptive failure rates was especially dramatic among teenagers and young women, a group at high risk for unintended pregnancies. Women under age 21 who used short-term birth control were nearly twice as likely as their older counterparts to become pregnant, whereas the failure rate for IUDs and implants was less than 1% regardless of age. \"It's not that birth control pills aren't effective, because they are -- when they're used perfectly,\" says Jeffery Peipert, M.D., a study author and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University Medical School, in St. Louis. \"But humans aren't perfect, and it's normal to forget to take a pill every day or file for prescription refills every month.\" Health.com: What's the best birth control for you? Birth control pills, the method of choice for 28% of U.S. women, are the most commonly used form of reversible contraception, but their effectiveness depends on consistent daily use. Nationally representative surveys have reported failure rates with the Pill similar to those seen in the current study. Patches and rings require less attentiveness than pills, but they still leave room for human error. The birth control patch (known by its brand name, Ortho Evra) needs to be changed weekly, while the...",

At an emergency meeting Tuesday, the country's main interest rate was raised by 4.25 percent to 12 percent. \"A hike in interest rates was necessary. And it needed to be decisive and credible and it was,\" explains Marios Maratheftis, Global Head of Macro Research for Standard Chartered Bank. \"The decision exceeded market expectations and in my opinion it absolutely had to.\" Central bankers in the most vulnerable emerging market economies are being forced into action. The Reserve Bank of India raised the country's key interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 8 percent this week. South Africa's central bank followed suit Wednesday. Their actions come as the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy making group will decide this week whether to trim another $10 billion in bond purchases as it continues to unwind stimulus support. The initial response was positive: investors pushed up equity markets and emerging market currencies Wednesday, starting in southeast Asia. The interest rate hikes by the bigger emerging markets are seen as an effort to plug severe leaks in a monetary dike which threatened to drain reserves that were being used to defend their currencies. Economist Nouriel Roubini, speaking at the CNN emerging market roundtable at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, described what we are witnessing as a perfect mini-storm which is being driven by the Federal Reserve, rising inflation, a slowdown in China's manufacturing sector and large current account deficits in a handful of developing countries. Argentina was the trigger point last week due to high spending and a sudden lifting of currency controls. Now investors have moved on to focus their attention on what Morgan Stanley has called the Fragile Five: Brazil, Indonesia, India, South Africa and Turkey.

But like many people who read her letter to her family, I wish I had. And in some ways I feel I have. In my two decades working in the humanitarian field responding to conflict, I have met some incredibly brave individuals who poured themselves into the work they did to build up the societies in which they were working. But at the same time, I have watched our ability to enter into places of need begin to disappear. One by one I have seen cities I love crumble. Daily life becomes intolerable. But the most painful thing has been watching our physical space and mobile access to do humanitarian and conflict mitigation shrink. Long gone are the days when the Red Cross, a press badge or the U.N. flag were perceived as neutral. The targeting of aid workers is not new. And it is not limited to the Middle East or ISIS strongholds -- it first came to international attention in Somalia in the late 1990s, and became of true global note in the early 2000s in Iraq and Afghanistan as the blurred lines between civilian, military, aid workers, journalists, security actors and intelligence created a justification for extremist and terror groups to pursue anyone. In other words, we cannot find our way in. When we do, we are seen as one of the aggressors or potential spies. We are seen as a commodity to embarrass Western countries by exploiting the media to shape public opinion. We are, in short, targets. Despite growing attention over the problem, little has been done to change this reality. Instead, the response has been that the decades-long practice of civil society groups not having weapons on their premises or traveling in armored vehicles was reversed. More and more, civilian and military cooperation has been the only way to enter conflict zones, and security is now a necessary component to most organizations' budgets. I do not know an aid worker, a war reporter or a conflict mediator who has not...",

Then he got his gun and fired at them and they ran. The 80-year-old homeowner says one of the fleeing burglars, a woman, shouted, \"I'm pregnant!\" He shot her twice, killing her. The woman was not pregnant, Ed Winter of the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office told CNN on Friday. The district attorney will decide whether Greer will face criminal charges. Long Beach Police Chief Jim McDonnell said Greer walked into his house Tuesday to find suspects Andrea Miller, 26, and Gus Adams, 28, ransacking it. According to McDonnell, Greer said this was the fourth time his house has been burglarized. Police say the couple beat and threw the elderly man to the ground, causing injuries, which included a broken collarbone, cuts and bruises. Despite his injuries, Greer managed to grab his gun and fire at the suspects, causing them to flee through the garage and into the alley, police said. In an interview with KNBC, Greer said that as the suspects ran into the alley, Miller yelled, \"'Don't shoot me, I'm pregnant! I'm going to have a baby!' and I shot her anyway.\" Miller died in the alley, the police chief said. When asked by KNBC how he felt about the incident, Greer responded that he had no regrets. \"I had to do what I had to do.\" Adams, the alleged accomplice, fled the scene, according to Greer and Chief McDonnell. He was later arrested and charged Friday with five felony counts, including murder in Miller's death, residential robbery , burglary, grand theft firearm and possession of a firearm by a felon. He's currently jailed on $1.25 million bond. Adams was scheduled for arraignment on Friday, but his court appearance at Los Angeles Superior Court in Long Beach was postponed until August 11.

        "Sum the following article in brief: Each year, 75,000 witnesses identify criminal suspects. Yet, as the New Jersey Supreme Court has acknowledged in a recent landmark case, there is \"a troubling lack of reliability in eyewitness identifications.\" In fact, given the risk of executing an innocent person, 16 states ban capital punishment. Yet, in Georgia, Troy Davis faces execution on Wednesday, even though seven out of nine witnesses have recanted their testimony against him. A study released Monday by the American Judicature Society, analyzing 850 photographic lineups, found that mistakes in identification are often related to how the photos of a line-up are presented. It found if a person uninvolved in the case presents the photos one-by-one, rather than all at once, fewer mistakes are made. Another critical factor is whether the authority presenting the photos knows who the suspect is. But it's not only the method of presentation that is skewing justice. It's also fear. I know.  I had my own bout with mistaken eyewitness testimony. A few years ago, on a bright clear sunny afternoon, I was driving on an empty Connecticut country road when a man ran out in front of my car from a field to my left, carrying a VCR in his arms.  The movement, and his incongruous burden, drew my attention. The man froze when he saw my car, and as I passed him our eyes met for a very long moment in the rear-view mirror. I will never forget the jolt of that confrontation.  I didn't understand at the time what I was seeing, but the fear, and something wilder, that I saw in his eyes was palpable. After I passed, he dodged into the bushes on the other side of the road and disappeared. I went on to do the errands of the day, while puzzling about the meaning of what I had just seen.  Four hours later I decided to tell this experience to the police. It was then I found out there had been a robbery in that neighborhood, a VCR had been stolen and a suspect caught.  But before he had been arrested, the suspect shot a police officer, who was in the hospital badly wounded.  The...",

Lavazza boss Antonio Baravalle told CNN that \"from a consumer point of view, we are facing a crisis in Italy because the market is losing 3% [to] 4%.\" Italy has been one of the worst hit countries in the eurozone's financial crisis.

Police said Harold Glenn Rodman, 52, was wearing a uniform and displayed a badge at the time of the attack. Rodman is a Transportation Security Administration officer at Dulles International Airport, the TSA confirmed. He has been removed from security operations pending the investigation. According to Prince William County, Virginia, police, a 37-year-old woman and her friend were walking in a Manassas neighborhood when a man who was unknown to them approached, displayed a badge and then sexually assaulted the woman before fleeing on foot. Police responded to a call at 3:25 a.m. Sunday and, while canvassing the neighborhood, noticed a man matching the attacker's description exit his home, police said. The man was arrested in connection with the incident, police said. Rodman is charged with abduction with intent to defile, aggravated sexual assault, forcible sodomy and object sexual penetration. A TSA spokesman said the TSA is working closely with police on the case. \"TSA holds its personnel to the highest professional and ethical standards, and investigates all allegations of misconduct,\" TSA spokesman Greg Soule said. \"The disturbing allegations against this individual in no way reflect the work of the more than 50,000 security officers who every day ensure the security of the traveling public.\"",

That's partly because I'm a former city of Atlanta police officer and served as a reserve police officer in Oxford, Mississippi, during my time on the faculty at the University of Mississippi's School of Law. I'm also a former assistant chief counsel (prosecutor) with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Many of my closest friends are in law enforcement. But, it is also, in large part, because I'm a middle-aged white guy. The killing of New York Police Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos was a violent act of cowardice. Did it somehow make \"sense\" to Ismaaiyl Brinsley, the accused shooter? Did he believe he was avenging the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner? Maybe. Probably. But to assign this incident any significance in the larger picture is pointless. We don't need to validate the terrible deed. What we need is to start an open and much needed discussion about relationships between the police and citizens in this country. \"No Justice, No Peace,\" is an often heard slogan at anti-police rallies. Anyone who believes in justice and peace cannot see Brinsley's alleged actions as anything but senseless murder that diverts us from finding solutions. What we need to do is find common ground. Our experiences shape our perceptions, which form our personal reality. As such, common ground in this context can be difficult. We each only have one set of experiences. An \"us against them\" attitude permeates both the police and many communities. Distrust is rampant on all sides. Can I understand what it is like to be African-American in the context of interacting with the police? No. But, if you haven't been a police officer you can't imagine what that job is like either. You frequently have to make split-second decisions. Along with the adrenaline, fear is part of the job. You never know what's going to happen to you. Is this an excuse? No. It is a call for better police training and more sensible (and more...",

Antibiotics, anesthetics, sanitary supplies and bandages -- all desperately needed to treat local fighters and civilians wounded during the siege of this crucial town near the Turkish border. U.S. airplanes are dropping medical supplies and weapons into this Kurdish city as defenders try to beat back the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. Not long ago, Kobani's fall to ISIS seemed certain. But foreign airstrikes and airdropped supplies could help turn the tide. \"We thank the people who brought these medical supplies,\" said Dr. Walat Omar, who has been braving enemy artillery for weeks to treat the wounded at a makeshift clinic. In exclusive video obtained by CNN from inside Kobani, Omar showed boxes of medicine in his clinic received from the airdrops. Even though local defenders control some 70% of the city, Kobani is cut off, and ISIS forces have been shelling it with mortars from the east and south, local government official Anwar Muslim said this week. More than 100,000 refugees have fled to Turkey amid weeks of intense fighting by Kurdish forces for full control of Kobani, a border town that's one of the last in the region to resist falling to ISIS.

Parts of the region could be plowing out from under 2 feet of snow and higher drifts by Saturday, when conditions are expected to gradually taper off. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning starting Thursday evening along the Interstate 25 corridor, including the city of Denver. Most areas east of the city are under a blizzard warning, as snowfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour were expected. The warnings will remain in effect into late Friday evening. The airport has nearly 300 pieces of snow equipment and a team of approximately 500 trained snow removal personnel who plan to work throughout the storm. An avalanche watch that had been posted for the Front Range and Sangre de Cristo mountains was expected to expire on Friday. But rapid heavy snow on top of the currently weak snowpack structure could also quickly raise the avalanche danger, according to The Colorado Avalanche Information Center website. The storm will be slow moving, so a prolonged period of snow will occur through early Saturday, according to the National Weather Service.

            "Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor, who asked for a priest \"to read her the last rites\" Sunday, left the hospital Monday afternoon because she \"wants to spend her final days at her home,\" her publicist said. Gabor, 93, is suffering complications from last month's hip-replacement surgery, but she and her husband decided against additional surgery, publicist John Blanchette said. Doctors told her the chances of success from the procedure was 50-50, so she chose to go home instead, Blanchette said. An ambulance carried the actress from Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles to her Bel Air, California, home Monday afternoon, he said. \"The doctors did everything they could do,\" her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, said. \"The rest is up to her to whether she recovers or not.\" Gabor has been hospitalized for most of the past month since breaking her hip in a fall from bed on July 17. Saturday marked Gabor's 24th wedding anniversary with Von Anhalt, her eighth husband. She was rushed to the hospital from her Bel Air, California, home Friday night, Blanchette said. She underwent surgery for the removal of a blood clot that night, a complication relating to her recent hip replacement surgery, he said. Gabor had just returned home from the hospital on Wednesday, three weeks after undergoing surgery to replace the broken hip. She has been frail and \"pretty much confined to a wheelchair\" since a 2002 car accident, said Von Anhalt. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her other husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, \"Moulin Rouge,\" \"The Story of Three Loves\" in 1953, \"The Girl in the Kremlin\" in 1957 and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, \"Touch of Evil.\""

        [
            "Washington (CNN) -- A divided federal appeals court has ruled that federal regulators went too far with new rules to control air pollution in parts of the eastern United States. The decision Tuesday is a blow for several states, the Obama administration and environmental groups, which had sought to prevent \"upwind states\" from emitting possibly unhealthy levels of contaminants across state borders, a requirement known as the \"good neighbor\" policy. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia concluded that the Environmental Protection Agency exceeded its authority when imposing the restrictions. \"When EPA quantified states' good neighbor obligations, it did not allow the states the initial opportunity to implement the required reductions with respect to sources within their borders,\" the 2-1 panel said. \"By doing so, EPA departed from its consistent prior approach to implementing the good neighbor provision and violated the act.\" The issue was tossed back to federal officials to rewrite the regulations. A number of states and power companies had sued over the July 2011 rule limiting power plant emissions in 28 \"upwind\" states. The court opinion written by Judge Brett Kavanaugh said some upwind states were unfairly being required to reduce emissions \"by more than their own significant contributions to a downwind state's nonattainment.\" Kavanaugh described a \"Catch-22\" scenario that would make it hard for states to comply with federal rules. \"EPA faults the states for not hitting that impossible-to-know target with their (State Implementation Plans) submissions,\" Kavanaugh said. \"In effect, EPA's view is that the only chance states have to hit the target is before EPA defines the target. By the time EPA makes the target clear, it's already too late for the states to comply.\" He was supported by Judge Thomas Griffith. Both were named to the bench by President George W. Bush. Less stringent rules set up by the Bush administration will now go into place until the rules are rewritten. The requirement..."

Deep within the Welsh university's department of engineering is a state-of-the-art \"lightning-lab\" where bolts of electricity are shot onto aircraft components. The idea is to recreate the conditions present when lightning strikes a plane at 35,000 feet, testing the fortitude of composite materials and conductor strips found on modern planes. \"There is a lightning strike every second around the world (and) every single aircraft is hit by lightning once a year,\" said Professor Manu Hadad of Cardiff University's Institute of Energy. Displaying the charred remains of two recently zapped plane panels, Hadad explains that a thin layer of copper mesh on an aircraft's exterior can drastically reduce the damage caused when lightning strikes. With support from the government and aerospace manufacturer, EADS, the ultimate aim of the $2 million project is to further refine and increase the working knowledge of how aircraft cope with these elements at altitude.

But while of particular interest to the electrical storm specialists at Cardiff University, lightning is just one of the many extreme weather phenomena encountered by planes when in the air.

            "(CNN) -- Every war veteran has stories. They can be shocking, harrowing, tragic -- sometimes even funny. The problem for families trying to understand those experiences, on Veterans Day and every day, is that they won't hear much about them. Many vets have trouble talking about them. This was the case with my father, who saw lots of action as an artilleryman in the Philippines during World War II. When I was a kid, I'd beg him for tales about the war. Usually, he waved me away. Sometimes, though, he gave in to my badgering. I found it strange that most of his accounts were short on the blood and guts bravado that my G.I. Joe comic books had led me to expect. Mostly, they were about men who simply wanted to do their job and go home, but found themselves subject to the deadly coin toss of war. Like today's soldiers recovering from injuries, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or haunted by images of fallen friends, he soon learned after returning home that he couldn't explain war to a civilian. He would carry this alone. \"There's no way anyone who wasn't there could understand,\" he would say. He shook his head telling about the time he had been relieved of duty at a forward observation post. Moments after he walked away, an enemy shell hit the site. It obliterated everyone there, including the friend who had just taken his place. He was lucky in war. I think that bothered him, too. His unit saw 187 days of active battle, but his only injury came when his leg was peppered with shrapnel during an assault. Gangrene set in. Doctors told him the leg had to come off or he could die. He refused to let the doctors operate, and they reluctantly respected his wishes. Then a new \"wonder drug\" arrived. It was the first batch of penicillin to reach the Philippines, and his life was saved. Why was he spared and others not? Again, he couldn't explain. One day, he heard that an acquaintance -- a kid from his hometown in Missouri -- had been killed in a nearby conflict. He drove to the battlefield to search for the..."

She is a 37-year-old Hijra -- a South Asian term for male-to-female transgendered people. She appears at ease when she speaks about her sexual orientation and about the stereotypes associated with her community. Aher is relaxed because she's in the confines of a non-profit workplace espousing the cause of sexual minorities like herself.  Here, she's not judged by her deep voice or her masculine face, its lines softened by make-up, or by her feminine dresses, nail-polish and jewelry. Aher has gained a new found place in her country.  India's Supreme Court recently granted her and other transgendered people, status as a third gender. So, men can now be identified as females and females can be identified as males. But the outside world, she says, is harsh. In a largely conservative, family-structured region, proclaiming you are not what you are born could entail a harrowing ordeal that Aher suffered -- and survived. She raised a few eyebrows when she first slipped into her mother's sari at the age of six. Her cross-dressing habits, she remembers, were then ignored for some time. But her secret desire to break free from her anatomic sex would only become more intense as she grew older. \"The issue about gender and sexuality kept coming back to me. But the unfortunate part of that was I did not have anybody to talk to; I had no one to share my thoughts with,\" Aher says. From rejection to acceptance . Aher's self-discovery created a sense of loss for her widowed mother, for whom Aher was a boy. \"My mother would take me to a temple and make me swear by God that I would change my behavior,\" Aher said. \"But it was beyond my control.\" And Aher was rejected. Her mother didn't speak with her for almost nine years. Her teachers weren't supportive either. Rather, she became a target of jeers. The hurt became deeper when she stepped into the adult world.

A security tower stands over the crowd that came to watch Barack Obama's inauguration. \"All of our stations are overcrowded,\" said Lisa Farbstein, spokeswoman for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. \"It's taking hours for people to get back into the stations.\" Police were holding people outside some Metro stations until there was room for them to get in, Farbstein said. But as evening fell and celebrations moved indoors, observers said crowd flow on the Metro system was smoother, if still an effort in patience. As of 7 p.m. Tuesday, the Metro had counted 973,285 passenger trips, setting a record with several hours and many miles yet to go. \"Throughout the weekend, we've effectively dealt with record-breaking crowds,\" said Metro General Manager John Catoe. \"By 5 p.m., people had taken nearly 874,000 trips, breaking yesterday's ridership record with nine more hours of service to go.\" Monday's 866,681 passenger trips had been the Metro record. The Metro numbers were just one record-setting tally in a day that lived up to expectations in sheer crowd size alone. Crowds on the National Mall were so large that the National Park Service began closing portions of it by 9 a.m., three hours before Obama took his oath of office. A crowd of 1.5 million people packed the Mall for the inauguration, according to an analysis of satellite imagery provided to CNN by IHS Jane's, a leading information provider on defense, international risk and national security. Officials said the massive security for the event was running smoothly, although there had been what they described as minor miscommunications, such as a Metro station entrance being closed when it was not supposed to be.

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- Just imagine, for a moment, a world in which Steve Jobs had never lived. How might daily life be different? Computers are still around, but not as you know them. They're complex, hateful things, mostly used in the office for spreadsheets and other business applications. Nobody bothered to sell a good-looking user interface with a desktop and mouse, because nobody could be sure there was a mass market for it. Thousands of people use PCs at home, but they're mostly hobbyists and amateur programmers. If you want to have fun with electronics, you hook up a videogame console to your TV. The Internet still exists, but it never really had as much of a platform to take root on. There's a thriving market in trading MP3s online, but all of it is illegal. The record labels never got their act together on selling digital copies of songs. MP3 players are large, clunky things with too many buttons. No movie studio makes really good computer-animated films. Smartphones are bulky bricks with thick keyboards. Touchscreen tablets exist -- as prototypes in a few computer labs. Okay, so maybe things wouldn't have been quite that bad without Jobs. Perhaps Xerox PARC's management would have figured out it was sitting on a goldmine in its Graphical User Interface and early-model mouse. Microsoft might have come up with Windows without the example of the Macintosh. Maybe Steve Wozniak would have found another compadre to help him design, sell and market the Apple II, the PC that started it all. But none of that seems very likely. Many words have been written attempting to distill the magic of Steve Jobs. To my mind, it boils down to this: He saved technology from itself. He stopped it from being scary to a mass audience. He took the excitement and optimism that Silicon Valley already felt about computing, and never ceased to find new ways to communicate that to the world. For all of his celebration of crazy revolutionaries who liked to \"think different,\" Jobs was a champion of the mainstream. His business idols, he liked to...",

            "(CNN) -- You've been in an accident. The police officer goes through the normal drill, asking for your license and registration. Then she goes a step further. \"Could I have your cellphone, please?\" she says. New legislation proposed by a New Jersey state Sen. James Holzapfel would let cops confiscate cellphones if they have \"reasonable grounds\" to believe that the driver was talking or texting when the wreck occurred. Officers would be required to return the phone after thumbing through its history. \"A lot of your accidents are happening due to distracted driving,\" Fair Lawn Police Sgt. Brian Metzler told CNN affiliate News 12. The trick, he said, is proving it. \"They're just going to say they're not paying attention. 'Were you on the cellphone?' 'No, I wasn't the cellphone' and it ends right there.\" The legislation is designed to cut down on distracted driving. But it comes at a time when revelations that the government has been monitoring our phone calls and online activities have shaken our sense of privacy. The bill set off alarm bells with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. \"Our State and Federal Constitutions generally require probable cause before authorizing a search, particularly when it comes to areas that contain highly personal information such as cellphones,\" said Alexander Shalom of the ACLU-NJ. \"The legislature cannot authorize searches unless there is probable cause, therefore the bill is likely susceptible to a constitutional challenge.\" Distracted Driving Laws . The distraction of technology . While the New Jersey bill is a bold new move in the battle against distracted driving, driver distractions are hardly new. Everything from billboards, to beautiful scenery, to pretty girls, have distracted drivers since the advent of automobiles. But new technologies are creating a growing storm of distractions for drivers, like cellphone apps, GPS units and music players, with the thousands of songs they put at our fingertips. In addition to taking a driver's eyes off the road and hands..."

Hannah Bonser, 26, was \u2018almost invisible\u2019 and her predictions that she would attack someone fell on deaf ears. In total 16 psychiatrists and 20 community workers were involved in her care over the years. Hannah Bonser, who was jailed for a minimum of 22 years, was 'almost invisible' to some groups, despite being in and out of mental health care since 2002 . They and mental health nurses \u2018missed . opportunities\u2019 to help Bonser and change her life for the better, said a . damning independent review of her treatment. It highlighted bad decisions, inept . leadership, inadequate information-sharing and an \u2018overly-optimistic\u2019 attitude by the professionals. Bonser was jailed for a minimum of 22 . years at Sheffield Crown Court in July after being convicted of . murdering Casey Kearney, a total stranger.

            "(CNN) -- Do you dare to overshare your kids' exploits on social media? From bragging \"mommyjackers\" and smug \"sanctimommies\" to pictures of poop-smeared kids and placenta art, blogger Blair Koenig has seen it all. In fact, she's made a career of cataloging examples from the worst parental offenders on her website STFU, Parents. Koenig has collected examples of the most frequent and flagrant Web etiquette violations into a new book, \"STFU, Parents: The Jaw-Dropping, Self-Indulgent, and Occasionally Rage-Inducing World of Parent Overshare.\" Read an e-mail Q&A with Koenig below, edited for clarity and brevity: . CNN: What inspired the website? Koenig: I started the site in March 2009 after noticing a lot of \"kidformation\" in my Facebook newsfeed. Several of my friends were new parents, and my feed was suddenly filled with updates about fluctuating fevers, diaper changes and nap times. I began thinking this was something others might be experiencing when a friend (and mom of two) sent me a few screen shots of her old college friends talking about their \"perfect\" children in their status updates. I had no idea back then just how much parents truly overshare about their kids. The examples that inspired the site now seem very tame. But regardless of what gets posted, the purpose of the blog has always been to highlight modern parenting trends while having a laugh. I'm interested in discussion and etiquette, but I also want it to be entertaining. CNN: Who contributes the photos and notes? Koenig: I've heard from everyone you could possibly imagine being Facebook friends with: friends of friends, co-workers, siblings, old high school acquaintances. For a long time, the majority of submissions came from nonparents, often people who worked with kids, like nannies, baby sitters and teachers. But a couple of years ago, I started getting a lot of submissions from parents, many of whom have parent friends that they find annoying.

            "(CNN) -- High ranking officials in North Korea on Wednesday paid their respects during the state funeral of the country's second-highest ranking military officer, Jo Myong Rok, according to the official Korean Central News Agency. Jo, 82, was vice marshal of the Korean People's Army. He died of a heart attack on Saturday, state media said. The high-ranking army official made history in 2000 when he became the first North Korean military officer ever to enter the U.S. Pentagon, later meeting then-President Bill Clinton. Jo's casket was carried by an armored car and escorted by motorcycles away from Pyongyang's Central Hall of Workers where mourners were permitted to gather, state media reported. The country's longtime leader Kim Jong Il and his son Kim Jong Un were among members of the funeral committee, state media said. Jo's death has fueled speculation over new leadership in North Korea. \"The old guard is fading in influence,\" said Scott Snyder, North Korea expert at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations. \"It's not clear if Kim Jong Un actually needs more titles to make it clear that he is on the rise,\" he said, referring to Kim Jong Il's son. North Korea has been ruled by the Kim family since 1948, and it is widely anticipated that Kim Jong Un will eventually succeed his father, but little is known about the apparent successor. The son of Kim's third wife, who died in 2004 from breast cancer, Kim Jong Un reportedly studied under a false name at the International School in Bern, Switzerland, before attending the Kim Il Sung military academy in Pyongyang. Some North Korea analysts believe, on the other hand, that he may never have left North Korea."

Such an act leaves us feeling shock and disbelief,\" Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store said in a written statement. Norway did not explain how it had learned of the alleged confiscation, and there was no immediate reaction from Iran. Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a written statement that it \"has reacted strongly\" and summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires on Wednesday afternoon to protest the move. During the meeting with the Iranian charge d'affaires, State Secretary Gry Larsen also expressed \"grave concern\" about how Ebadi's husband has allegedly been treated. \"Earlier this autumn, he [Ebadi's husband] was arrested in Tehran and severely beaten. His pension has been stopped and his bank account has been frozen,\" the statement from Norway said. Store said in the statement that it marked the \"first time a Nobel Peace Prize has been confiscated by national authorities.\" The peace prize is one of five awarded annually since 1901 by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden. The other four prizes are for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry and literature. Starting in 1969, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel also has been awarded. While the other prizes are awarded by committees based in Sweden, the peace prize is determined by a five-member panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament. Ebadi received the prize for her focus on human rights, especially on the struggle to improve the status of women and children. A statement from the Nobel committee at the time said, \"As a lawyer, judge, lecturer, writer and activist, she has spoken out clearly and strongly in her country, Iran, and far beyond its borders.\"",

But, from an early age, Perez says, his first-born made clear a preference for pink clothes, dolls and \"anything princess.\" The family lived in Mexico at the time and decided to support her choices. She grew her hair long and wore pink clothes to school. She was 5 years old in December 2012 when she declared that she wanted to ditch the boy toys, pierce her ears and \"live fully\" as a girl -- pronouns and all, Perez said. Her parents again decided to respect her wishes. Since moving from Mexico City to New York in 2013, they've only told school officials and close friends about her transition. They want people to get to know her without preconceived notions. Perez asked to withhold her name from this article to avoid making her a poster child on the Internet for transgender youth. There have been ups and downs, but seeing his daughter happy on a daily basis leaves no doubt in Perez's mind that \"this is the way she is.\" When the opportunity arose for the family to walk in New York City's annual Pride March this Sunday, she was eager to participate to show that she's not ashamed of who she is and that she supports others like her. \"We are happy to be a part of something like the parade, and that's because we are happy to be supportive of her,\" Perez said in a phone interview from his New York home. \"She has taught us -- and I totally agree -- that it's nothing to be ashamed of.\" 'Pride is for kids, too' The Perez walked with other families of gender nonconforming children in a group of 150 people led by the Ackerman Institute's Gender and Family Project.

Budget Travel editors reveal favorite online resources to book flights, hotels and other needs. Dohop.com . Strictly for booking plane trips entirely outside of the U.S., such as a flight between Paris and Rome. The site runs simultaneous searches of multiple airports serving the same city -- five airports in London, for instance -- and it retrieves fares from no-frills independent carriers like EasyJet and Ryanair, which many better-known travel sites overlook. That said, be warned that Dohop doesn't work nearly as well for booking airfares leaving the U.S. Kayak.com . The all-time best site for finding the cheapest plane tickets in the U.S. Our biggest beef with Kayak's competitors is that when you click to book a fare, they typically direct you to a new page. Sometimes it's only then that you find out your actual departure time -- or worse, you're forced to plug in your dates and departure cities all over again, only to discover far different results. Kayak stands apart. Once you've found a good flight on Kayak, click on the price and you'll be sent directly to the airline's Web site, where the exact price for the exact flight you selected unfailingly appears. Another perk: If you are flexible on your travel dates, we recommend you try Kayak's flexible-date search tool, which covers the broadest scope of routes and airports of any site we've tested.

Libya's combative leader also condemned Thursday's attack that reportedly killed three people. Gadhafi left this message to NATO: \"I live in the hearts of millions, and even if you kill my body, you cannot kill my soul that lives in the hearts of millions.\" The audio message was released after the Italian foreign minister raised the possibility that the Libyan leader may have been injured after weeks of NATO airstrikes in the country. Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said he did not have any evidence as to Gadhafi's fate, but Monsignor Giovanni Martinelli, the Catholic archbishop of Tripoli, told him that Gadhafi was wounded, the Italian ANSA news agency reported. Martinelli said Gadhafi was most likely not in Tripoli anymore, Frattini said. However, Libyan government spokesman Musa Ibrahim said Friday that Ghadafi was in \"good health and high spirits\" in Tripoli. Four rockets struck Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound Thursday and killed at least three people, according to a Libyan government official.

            "(EW) -- After four years off of the silver screen, James Bond made his triumphant return this weekend in \"Skyfall\" \u2014 and the British spy's appeal was bigger than ever. The action thriller grossed a truly massive $87.8 million in its first three days (and an additional $2.2 million during Thursday night previews), making its debut the very best in the Bond series' 23-film history \u2014 by a huge margin. \"Skyfall\" shattered the previous opening weekend record for a Bond film, which was set in 2008 when \"Quantum of Solace\" bowed with $67.5 million. With the lucrative Thanksgiving holiday on the horizon and a straight \"A\" CinemaScore grade, it's likely that \"Skyfall\" will also become the first Bond movie to ever pass the $200 million mark at the domestic box office. (Of course, this is not accounting for inflation.) EW critics disagree on 'Skyfall' \"Skyfall's\" debut marks the seventh-best November opening weekend of all time \u2014 behind two \"Twilight\" films and four \"Harry Potter\" titles \u2014 and the film, which Sony and MGM spent about $200 million to make, garnered an impressive $25,050 per theater average from 3,505 theaters. \"Skyfall's\" per-theater average was even more impressive in IMAX locations, where the film found $13.1 million (15 percent of its weekend gross) from 320 screens, good for a $40,938 average. Daniel Craig, the sixth man to play Bond, has seen his popularity as the character surge since taking over the iconic role in 2006. His first Bond film, \"Casino Royale,\" debuted with $40.8 million on the way to a $167.4 million finish. Two years later, \"Quantum of Solace\" opened 65 percent higher with $67.5 million on the way to $168.5 million total. (Reception for the film was tepid, which is why its endurance at the box office was so much weaker than \"Casino Royale's.\") And now \"Skyfall\" has improved upon \"Quantum's\" opening weekend by 30 percent. At this rate, Craig's next turn as Bond (due in 2014) could garner well over $100 million in its debut frame. EW poll: 'Skyfall's' Silva is ... Before the weekend..."

Homes that once sheltered families now ripped open, their insides spilling out like intestines. These haunting images were captured in Aleppo in June by Italian photographer Matteo Rovella. While many photographers concentrate on the faces of Syria's brutal conflict, Rovella saw another side: what happens when a person's private space becomes ripped open by war. \"You see such scenes, and you imagine the moment when people had to escape from the rooms,\" he said. \"I imagine the people who must run away -- or die.\" Rovella had visited several camps on both sides of the Syria-Turkey border in early 2013. Thanks to a friend in the city keeping him up to date with events, he decided in June to head to the Syrian city of Aleppo, which has been ravaged in fighting between government and rebel fighters. Syrians take steps toward healing . After organizing a car ride with a man from the Free Syrian Army, the main opposition rebel force, he crossed the border from Turkey. Many journalists choose to enter with the rebels for better access and less censorship than with the Syrian government, he said. The trip to Aleppo involved nerve-jangling encounters with armed checkpoints and constant fear of discovery. Just carrying a camera was dangerous, he said, particularly since the abduction of several foreign journalists in the country. \"There are many independent armed gangs, and they could stop you, rob you, kidnap you and in the worst case, kill you.\" When he arrived in Aleppo and began to work, photographing and interviewing Free Syrian Army fighters and local residents, he saw much of the city's precious historical monuments damaged or destroyed and neighborhoods smashed to pieces. At one point, while he was interviewing a local rebel commander, a mortar wheeled overhead, slamming into two fighters less than 100 meters from him. \"It was horrible.

        "In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?\n\nArticle: (CNN) -- For the second time in as many years -- after going 46 years with the same coach, Joe Paterno -- Penn State has named a new man to helm its storied football program. James Franklin, 41, was announced Saturday as the Nittany Lions' next football coach, replacing Bill O'Brien, who was hired in January 2012 and recently left to become head coach of the NFL's Houston Texans. \"I'm excited to come home,\" said Franklin, who had led Vanderbilt University's football team the last three years but originally hails from Langhorne, Pennsylvania. \"I'm a Pennsylvania boy with a Penn State heart.\" A former assistant coach at the University of Maryland and Kansas State University, Franklin took over a Vanderbilt team that went 2-10 in 2010 and led them to a 24-15 record and three straight bowl appearances. Franklin joins a program that is still rocked, in many ways, by fallout from the child sex abuse scandal involving former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. In addition to leading to Sandusky's conviction on 45 counts involving 10 young victims, the ordeal led to cover-up allegations and criminal charges involving three former Penn State administrators, including one-time President Graham Spanier. And as the scandal was first unfolding, Paterno was ousted as the football team's coach. He died a short time later. The NCAA imposed harsh sanctions on Penn State in the wake of what happened, including scholarship reductions, a post-season ban, a $60-million fine and 13 years of vacated wins. The Nittany Lions' team nonetheless surprised many with its performance under O'Brien, finishing 8-4 in 2012 and 7-5 this season. But there remained a perception that Paterno supporters weren't fully supportive of the new coach, with reports that sentiment played some part in O'Brien's exit. Paterno's widow, Sue, released a statement Saturday welcoming Franklin -- who described the late coach as the \"great Joe Paterno\" during Saturday's press conference. \"His deep ties to Pennsylvania and his exceptional coaching record have...",

A portrait of Eluana Englaro taken in July 2008 in Italy. Englaro has been in a vegetative state for nearly 17 years. Eluana Englaro suffered irreversible brain damage in a car crash in 1992, when she was 20 years old. For years, her father has fought to have her feeding tube removed, saying it would be a dignified end to his daughter's life. Beppino Englaro says that before the crash, his daughter visited a friend who was in a coma and told him she didn't want the same thing to happen to her should she ever be in the same state. Euthanasia is illegal in Italy, but patients have the right to refuse treatment. It is on that basis that Englaro argued his daughter should be allowed to die, because she had expressed the wish not to be kept alive while in a coma -- indirectly refusing treatment, he said. \"We knew Eluana well, and we always thought of her as a champion of freedom,\" her father said in October. \"She had clear ideas about her life and for her, life was about freedom -- not an obligation to live.\" A series of legal battles finally ended in November, when Italy's highest court, the Court of Cassation, upheld a lower court ruling allowing Englaro to suspend his daughter's treatment. But although Englaro had cleared the last legal hurdle, the court's decision sparked a new fight to find a hospital or clinic that would take out Eluana's feeding tube. Several clinics initially came forward to say they could do it, but the Italian health minister then issued a decree to remind them of their duty of care. Under pressure to adhere to his decree, the clinics backed off. Finally, a private clinic in the northeastern Italian city of Udine agreed to assist in Eluana's case. Monday night, Eluana was transferred from the church-run hospital in Lecco, north of Milan, where she had been kept alive to the Udine...",

But that appears doubtful based on past experiences. Pregnant West Virginia women told to drink bottled water . \"Chemical Valley,\" as it's known, has a less than stellar record. This is the third major accident in just over five years. In 2008, a Bayer Cropscience pesticide explosion killed two workers and injured eight others. Two years later, three consecutive accidents at a DuPont plant released a deadly nerve agent used in World War I, killing one worker. The Chemical Safety Board investigated and in both cases found that the companies cut critical corners to save money. In the Bayer Cropscience explosion, the report found multiple \"deficiencies\" and \"critical omissions.\" In the DuPont accident, the CSB found \"numerous safety deficiencies\" and \"incomplete investigations\" of previous near accidents.

It's not that Nesb\u00f8 doesn't care for the comparison. He just believes it's misleading. The 51-year old from Oslo, Norway says he has more in common with American hard-boiled crime fiction. Nesb\u00f8 (pronounced NESS-buh) is a former professional soccer player, musician and stock broker, who eventually turned to writing. He was writing bestsellers for ten years before Larsson's \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" was published. While his crime novels have sold nine million copies worldwide, he's just becoming widely known in the United States, but his new novel will likely change that. \"The Snowman\" hit bookstores in the United States last week and is winning raves from American critics. It's Nesb\u00f8's seventh novel featuring police detective and recovering alcoholic, Harry Hole (pronounced WHO-leh). It's a terrifying thriller, about the hunt for a serial killer, who leaves a snowman as his calling card. The book is already a bestseller in Britain, won Norway's novel of the year in 2008, and appears headed for the big screen. \"The Snowman\" has been optioned by Working Title films, ironically, the same production company behind the movie version of \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\" Nesb\u00f8 was at the Cannes Film Festival last week to promote \"Headhunters\" a movie based on another of his novels. He's now touring a handful of U.S. cities to promote \"The Snowman.\" CNN caught up with the author this week. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: For new readers, tell us a little about your main character Harry Hole. Nesb\u00f8: It is not easy to summarize the protagonist of the series in a few words, but here are some features of Harry's personality that are important to me when I write about him: He's the type of guy who is driven by his good side as well as his darker side.

            "ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN)  -- The governments of Armenia and Turkey will sign a peace agreement in Zurich on Saturday that would normalize relations after nearly a century of animosity between the neighboring nations, the Swiss government said Friday. The Swiss-mediated peace deal would also open the border between the countries, which has been shut since 1993. The signing ceremony comes more than a month after Armenia and Turkey announced they had agreed to start six weeks of \"internal political consultations\" on two protocols aimed at establishing diplomatic and bilateral relations. The Swiss-mediated peace deal would also open the border between the countries, which has been shut since 1993. The border was closed after Turkey objected to Armenia's war with Turkish ally Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabagh. Neither country has an embassy in the other's capital. Turkish-Armenian relations have often been overshadowed by the dispute over the massacre of ethnic Armenians in the final days of the Ottoman Empire, more than 90 years ago. Armenians accuse Ottoman Turks of committing genocide, killing more then a million Armenians starting in 1915. Modern-day Turkey vehemently rejects the allegations. The proposed protocols for normalizing relations call for creating a committee of international experts to research archives and \"restore mutual confidence between the two nations.\" There is no mention of the disputed territory of Karabagh, which Armenian troops have controlled since the 1993 Armenian-Azerbaijan war. But the success of the protocols is still uncertain, as the parliaments of both countries still must ratify the agreement. A senior U.S. State Department official -- authorized to brief reporters without attribution because of diplomatic sensitivities -- said the situation remains \"difficult.\" \"There's opposition both in Turkey and in Armenia,\" the senior official said Thursday, \"but both governments realize ultimately it's in their interest to have normalized relations and an open..."

A proposal for the ban in unicorporated areas was unanimously endorsed by the county supervisors and is  scheduled to be formally adopted on December 7, officials  said. The ordinance would then take effect 30 days later, officials  said. Meanwhile, the Orange County Board of Supervisors also approved Tuesday, by a 4-1 vote, a first reading of an identical ban. A second and final reading is scheduled, also for December 7, a spokeswoman said. \"Attracting crime and other nuisances, these facilities have a negative impact on the communities where they've operated -- leading more than 100 cities and nine counties in California to pass similar ordinances,\" said Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich.  \"Since many municipalities in Los Angeles County currently have either a ban or moratorium, adjacent unincorporated communities would become the obvious location of choice for dispensary operators -- creating an undue burden for residents in these areas.\" Both measures address a growing number of illegally operated medical marijuana dispensaries in unincorporated areas of the two counties. Officials cited health and safety concerns, saying food products containing marijuana that are produced without regulation could contain potentially harmful ingredients, food borne disease and pesticide residue. The proposals in the first and third largest counties in California mark another setback for advocates seeking to advance marijuana into mainstream society. Earlier this month, California voters rejected a proposal to legalize the drug, though medical marijuana is legal throughout the state. The Los Angeles County ban affects unincorporated communities with a population of 1.5 million people. In Orange County, the ban would affect 119,000 people, a spokeswoman said.

The former president \"is well and alive and will be brought to justice,\" said the country's ambassador to the United Nations, Youssoufou Bamba. He and the French Embassy said forces loyal to Ouattara made the arrest. But a Gbagbo adviser, Ahoua Don Mello, said earlier that the French military had stormed Gbagbo's residence.

It's not that most journalists lean left on such social issues as gay rights, though that's hard to dispute. It's that the power of pictures can neutralize political propaganda. Once same-sex marriage was legalized in such early states as Iowa and Massachusetts, the photos and footage of happy couples celebrating made clear that no one was really threatened by such unions. The visuals put a human face on the debate. Even as stories quoted people who remained staunchly opposed to same-sex marriage, the pictures conveyed that the sky was not falling -- and by the time New York, Maryland and Washington legalized same-sex unions, it was, well, less newsworthy. But that's hardly true everywhere, as a stunning backlash in Mississippi makes clear. The first known gay wedding in the town of Laurel, Mississippi, was, naturally, a story for the local paper. And it was a story with a heart-rending twist. An article in the the Laurel Leader-Call recounted Jessica Powell's wedding to Crystal Craven, who was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer and has had three operations in the past year. It was a moving piece that described how Craven, at the wedding, wore a white cowboy hat to hide the scars from her latest surgery. \"If chemo doesn't work,\" she said, \"we don't know what happens after that.\" Watch: Is the murdered model's beauty driving the Oscar Pistorius coverage? The result: A torrent of angry calls, canceled subscriptions and outraged comments on the paper's website and Facebook page. As recounted by Deep South Progressive, one person wrote: \"This is what we have to put up with on the world news every night. Never thought I would open my local paper and see such. Insulting!!!\" Said another: \"It's a sad day for traditional family values when this is printed on the front of a newspaper.\" The paper's owner, Jim Cegieklski, responded in an op-ed: . \"You...",

'There is no justification for this kind of attack on people in a private residence. Hopefully the justice authorities will react to the perpetrators of this act.' The British victim said he was fine but did not wish to discuss the matter for fear of identifying his partner and making him more vulnerable to acts of homophobic violence.

Gay rights organisations have expressed shock at the treatment they have received.

But \"Lost in Thailand,\" which picked up the highest grossing film at Hong Kong's Asian Film Awards on Monday night, flopped outside mainland China -- only collecting $57,000 in the United States and $72,000 in Hong Kong, according to figures from consultancies Film Business Asia and Beijing-based Entgroup. The film earned $202 million in China, making the unexpected hit the most profitable movie ever after Hollywood extravaganza \"Avatar.\" \"We heard that it is not doing well overseas, or could be considered a failure, due to the cultural differences,\" Entgroup's Aiden Sun told CNN. China's movie market is the world's second largest, in terms of box office takings, but its films are a hard sell for international audiences. Poor marketing, a lack of recognizable stars and plot lines and humor that get muddled in translation weigh against Chinese films and it's a trend that's not improving despite the country's thriving movie industry. While Chinese-language films have never been mainstream viewing for English-speaking audiences, a decade ago titles such as \"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,\" \"Hero\" and \"In the Mood for Love\" captured the imagination of movie buffs worldwide. Today, according to industry players at Hong Kong's Filmart trade fair this week that accompanies the Asian Film Awards, it is getting harder to sell Chinese films, even in markets with a shared language and culture such as Singapore. \"The enthusiasm created by \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" is no longer there. We are starting more or less from scratch -- whether and how we can rebuild the international market for Chinese language films,\" said Jeffrey Chan, who is charge of international sales for Chinese studio Bona Film Group. Part of the reason is stronger local-language film production in places...",

The Department of Justice will announce Thursday that it will send seven more agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to join the 45 already stationed in Chicago. In announcing the reinforcements, Attorney General Eric Holder says that his office \"will continue to do everything in its power to help the city of Chicago combat gun violence. These new agents are a sign of the federal government's ongoing commitment to helping local leaders ensure Chicago's streets are safe.\" The move is among measures that federal and local agencies have taken in a city known for its crime problem, highlighted by an outbreak of shootings during the July Fourth weekend. The Department of Justice points to the cross-state component of gun crime in Chicago as one reason for the federal-local partnership: Sixty percent of the guns seized in Chicago crimes originate from out of state. The coordinated effort involves manpower; $6.6 million in Justice Department funds to address youth violence; and intelligence, with the Chicago Crime Gun Intelligence Center opening in June. The department has also partnered with grassroots organizations in Chicago to increase community-based crime prevention. 3 killed in Chicago weekend violence .

Earlier in the day, the House Veterans Affairs Committee voted to subpoena Shinseki in the wake of accusations that his department is responsible for deadly delays in health care at some of its hospitals. The Shinseki subpoena will cover e-mails that allegedly discussed the destruction of a secret list, first reported by CNN, of veterans waiting for care at a Phoenix VA hospital.

On May 1, Shinseki issued a written statement announcing that the director of the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system and two others have been placed on administrative leave amid claims of a secret waiting list and allegations that 40-plus veterans died waiting for care. \"We believe it is important to allow an independent, objective review to proceed,\" Shinseki wrote. \"These allegations, if true, are absolutely unacceptable and if the Inspector General's investigation substantiates these claims, swift and appropriate action will be taken.\" Phoenix VA officials deny secret wait list; doctors say they're lying . Shinseki told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that he would not resign over the allegations. \"I serve at the pleasure of the president,\" Shinseki told the newspaper when asked whether he would step down. \"I signed on to make some changes.

Here is a timeline of Craig Spencer's movements since he got back from the West African nation: . When did he return from Guinea? Spencer came back to the United States last week after treating Ebola patients in Guinea, where he worked for Doctors Without Borders. He completed his work in Guinea on October 12 and left the country two days later via Brussels, Belgium. He arrived at John F.

The physician, who works at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, was checking his temperature twice a day. He has not seen any patients since his return. Did he have any symptoms? The 33-year-old did not have any symptoms just after his return, but he developed a fever, nausea, pain and fatigue Thursday morning, authorities said. He began feeling sluggish a couple of days ago, but his fever spiked to 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit (about 38 Celsius) the day his symptoms appeared. How many people has he been in contact with? Spencer was in contact with a few people after he started exhibiting symptoms. Ebola isn't contagious until someone has symptoms.

Michael A. Dotro was arrested on Thursday at his home in Manalapan, New Jersey, after an investigation by the Middlesex County prosecutor's office and the Monroe Township Police Department. That investigation determined that a fire at the police captain's home early on May 20 had been intentionally started outside the house. Police, EMT personnel and firefighters were called to the two-story, colonial-style home of police Capt. Mark Anderko shortly before 4 a.m. on May 20. Anderko was in the house with his wife, two children and 92-year old mother. The fire was extinguished within 10 to 15 minutes and there were no injuries, but the house was damaged. \"The investigators described it as considerable, one part of the house had damage on the first and second floor of the home, \" said Jim O'Neil, spokesman for the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office. Dotro, 35, was charged with five counts of attempted murder and one count of aggravated arson, authorities said. A nine-year veteran of the Edison police department, he was suspended from his job with pay. Dotro's lawyer, Lawrence Bitterman, said that his client is \"in shock\" and had told Bitterman that \"he can't believe he's being arrested.\" Superior Court Judge Bradley Ferencz on Friday upheld previously set bail conditions on Friday, which included a $5 million bail. If the bail is posted, Dotro must surrender his firearms and passport and may not have any contact with the victims. \"I believe they have the wrong guy,\" said Bitterman. Bitterman said that Dotro also told him, \"The thought of anyone doing this to his brother officer makes me (Dotro) sick.\" Citing court restrictions, the prosecutor's office declined to give details of the evidence or to talk about the motive. The investigation is still ongoing but Bitterman said the search warrant didn't return any incriminating evidence."

And yet, as the Libyan government faced a stiff popular uprising, it was Moammar Gadhafi's second eldest son -- and not the Leader of the Revolution himself -- who was first to talk to the nation about the unrest and detail a plan to address it. The speech, made early Monday on Libyan state television, does not mean that Saif Gadhafi has usurped power from his father: Senior U.S. officials said there's no indication the elder Gadhafi is losing his grip. Still, many were left thinking: Why did Saif speak? There was no public explanation why his father, who state-run TV showed repeatedly being showered with support as his limousine rolled down a packed Tripoli street or in a crowded hall, didn't talk. One way to explain the choice, said David Schencker of the Washington Institute for Near East Affairs think tank, is Moammar Gadhafi is \"consistently inconsistent\" -- meaning, his decisions are famously hard to understand or predict. Still, experts say, what may make Saif stand out most is that, among his relatives, he seems the polar opposite of his father. \"I don't think Saif is a hated figure,\" said Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank. \"He has seemed to have some good intentions.\" Whereas Moammar Gadhafi years ago launched a program to \"destroy imported ideologies, whether they are Eastern or Western,\" his son speaks fluent English, earned his PhD from the London School of Economics, written an op-ed in the New York Times and has been a frequent go-between in talks with international officials.

Both teams had already qualified for the quarterfinals of the 50-over tournament, but the highest-placed sides should avoid Group B heavyweights such as India and South Africa. Sri Lanka's fourth victory in six games left the co-hosts above Australia on run differential, meaning they will finish second, with New Zealand a point back in third place. The Australians, seeking a fourth successive title, complete their group campaign in Colombo on Saturday against fourth-placed Pakistan -- who have also qualified for the last eight and who could top the table with a win. New Zealand restricted Sri Lanka to 265-9, with skipper Kumar Sangakkara top-scoring on 111 as he made his first World Cup century. Sangakkara put on 145 for the third wicket with Mahela Jayawardene, who was controversially given not out in the 24th over when bowler Nathan McCullum dived to pluck a return catch. Television replays showed that the Black Caps player had grasped the ball before it touched the grass, but umpire Asad Rauf told Jayawardene to stay at the crease after consulting with video official Amiesh Saheba. Jayawardene went on to make 66 off 90 balls before becoming the second of Tim Southee's three victims, while McCullum struck twice as the last seven wickets fell for 101 runs.

Yesterday, the IOM panel sought to redefine chronic fatigue syndrome, setting five main symptoms as simple criteria for doctors to use in making a diagnosis. Experts also called for a new name for the condition, because many patients feel the term 'chronic fatigue' belittles their suffering.

O'Leary said one of the goals of the mission is to determine the source of the H7N9 virus which was first discovered only three weeks ago. Officials from the WHO, as well as experts from the U.S. and European Centers for Disease Control, are expected to investigate the virus alongside Chinese health authorities in Shanghai and Beijing in the coming days. Five new infections of the H7N9 virus were recorded in Shanghai and nearby provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Henan. On Thursday, the government suspended wild bird sales to try to prevent the spread of the virus, although many questions remain as to the source of infection. It follows a ban on live poultry trading in affected provinces. A large number of birds have also been slaughtered, Xinhua said. In his statement to a room packed full of journalists, O'Leary said there was legitimate reason for concern about the new virus, but suggested it was premature to begin mass culling of poultry. \"I eat chicken every day,\" O'Leary said with a laugh. \"Chicken is of no concern at all.\" However, posts on the country's microblogging sites suggested that some users were anxious about going anywhere near poultry products. \"After H7N9, I don't even dare to eat an egg.

The airstrikes were the latest in a string of attacks reported in Aleppo, the northwest Syrian city that has been a hotly contested area in Syria's civil war. A day earlier, Syrian forces dropped barrel bombs on an opposition-held area of Aleppo, killing 25 children, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. The unrest comes amid Syria's three-year civil war pitting government forces against rebels trying to end the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The government intends to hold elections June 3. Al-Assad, whose family has had a tight grip on power for 43 years, is running for another term. The United Nations is asking the government to reconsider the election because of the war. More than 100,000 people, including many civilians, have been killed, according to the United Nations. Al-Assad succeeded his father in 2000 and won a second term in 2007, unopposed.",

        "In 2 or 3 sentences, what are the main points one should remember from this news article?\n\nArticle: (CNN) -- America's most brilliant document declares all men are created equal, however the same cannot be said for all dresses. Forty years ago, Diane von Furstenberg created a superior, yet remarkably democratic, dress. Though von Furstenberg was only in her 20s, an awkward time for many young women, she proved to have perfect timing when she unleashed her little dress onto the American fashion landscape. And little did she know that it, and she, would become the timeless icons of glamorous practicality they are today. The 1970s were a time when many women were entering the white-collar work force and also declaring their sexual independence. This was a radical combination of recognizing newfound professional power and redefining old sexual restrictions. Diane von Furstenberg gave this new woman something new to wear for her new career and new sex life. The wrap literally dressed the movement. It liberated women from the stuffy and stiff male-imagined \"working gal\" get-ups; it was easy to put on and take off; it was smart, affordable and traveled well. The fabric was clingy but not cumbersome; it celebrated a woman's silhouette instead of trying to control it. The wrap dress would sway with a woman to her first big job, then seamlessly swing with her to her first hot date. DVF designed a dress for the new American woman on the move. Rarely have we seen such a democratic design. The DVF wrap dress embraces diversity like no other before it or since. It can be worn well by women aged 20 to 70 and sizes 0 to 20. It comes in classic solids and a plethora of prints, can be layered with everything from denim jackets to floor-length furs. Piles of jewels can fill the open front V-neckline or an elegant collarbone can be the sole accessory. The DVF wrap dress is often the symbol that one has gotten her first \"real\" job, yet it is equally appropriate if you occupy the corner office. As many women abandon early adult outfits, the wrap dress endures. Most clothing designs are intended to date you, socioeconomically...",

            "(CNN) -- Afghan and coalition soldiers killed more than 30 insurgents, including 13 would-be suicide bombers, as they fought off assaults on two military bases and government buildings in eastern Afghanistan, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said on Sunday. The attacks, which happened Saturday morning, were led by Haqqani network insurgents and were against Forward Operating Base Salerno and Forward Operating Base Chapman, ISAF said. Both bases are located in Khost province, a volatile region on Afghanistan's rugged border with Pakistan. The Haqqani network is a militant group with ties to al Qaeda. Insurgents clad in U.S. military uniforms and wielding rocket-propelled grenades and small arms launched simultaneous attacks on the two bases, ISAF said. ISAF had previously reported more than 20 insurgents had died in the fighting. Thirteen of the insurgents killed were wearing suicide vests, ISAF said, adding that Afghan and coalition soldiers followed up on intelligence tips and later captured a commander involved in planning the attacks. \"The insurgents' attempts to attack ISAF or Afghan government facilities were defeated again. The insurgent leadership who direct these ill-conceived attacks far from the actual battlefield knows their low-level fighters have no chance of success against these targets,\" Brig. Gen. Josef Blotz, an ISAF spokesman, said in a statement. Separately on Sunday, ISAF said Afghan and international forces captured a senior Taliban commander in Logar province. Zia Ul-Haq is accused of helping foreign fighters and suicide bombers get into the capital, Kabul. He was captured along with a sub-commander and another insurgent on Wednesday, ISAF said in a statement. Chapman is the same base where a suicide bomber killed seven CIA officers late last year."

The toddler, nicknamed Yueyue, had been cared for in a hospital in Guangdong province since she was injured a week ago. She succumbed to severe injuries Friday morning. Two hit-and-run drivers ran over Yueyue, one after another, after she wandered into the alley outside her father's hardware store. Both fled the scene but are now under arrest. But there was one thing more shocking than the double hit-and-run: the seeming apathy by pedestrians, cyclists and drivers\u201418 of them\u2014who did not stop to help. Yueyue laid motionless in the street for 10 minutes until Chen Xianmei, a 58-year-old woman who collects trash for a living, passed by. She moved her to safety and called for help. A security camera captured the incident on tape. After the video was posted online, Yueyue's plight prompted sympathy, outrage and debate in and outside China. How could 18 people pass by the critically injured child and do nothing? The incident has also prompted widespread soul-searching in China about the state of the nation's morality and civic-consciousness. Why is it so difficult for Chinese nowadays to be a Good Samaritan? There are many possible explanations and many possible culprits. Some blame it on the lack of laws and regulations. Others argue it's caused by the failure of China's education system to inculcate respect for human life and dignity. Still others blame it on what some call \"jingshen kongxu\", or spiritual vacuum. As the country's 1.3 billion people compete to make money and climb the economic and social ladder, experts say, many people find themselves spiritually adrift. Reynard Hing, an astute China-watcher, cautions against making sweeping conclusions. \"It's funny how many people read into this, to the point that anti-Chinese sentiment arises,\" he wrote me. \"This situation is not unique to China.\" He cites the case of Kitty Genovese.

VBS.TV is the broadband television network of VICE. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. This video contains vivid images depicting extremely graphic violence. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- We thought that since you were feeling absolutely dejected watching BP's underwater gusher spoiling the ecology and economy of the Gulf of Mexico, well, we would try to cheer you up by reminding you how the otherwise environmentally conscious Canadians are degrading their own natural splendor and national soul with oil spillage and seepage on purpose. Bitumen -- A.K.A. tar sand -- is barely oil. It's oil-soaked dirt, but in a world that is constantly scraping the bottom of the fossil fuel barrel, tar sand is oil enough to warrant a mad frenzy to extract. And that's exactly what is happening in the Canadian northwest. Northern Alberta is rich -- very rich -- in bitumen. Fort McMurray is the small town at the epicenter of a boom in tar sand extraction, and it's a messy, ecologically unsound adventure. Traditionally, the only way to get oil from the dirt has been to cook it. So, every day, massive excavators rip apart the Boreal forest (also known as the lungs of Canada) to get at the soggy oil sand below, and then millions of gallons of pristine Athabascan water are intentionally spoiled in order to boil the oil out of the dirt (or is it the dirt out of the oil?). It's a very messy, destructive process, which has contaminated rivers and lakes for miles in every direction. See the rest of \"Toxic: Alberta\" at VBS.TV . There is a newer method of extraction, called SAGD, in which steam is injected deep underground, cooking the oil out of the dirt and then..."

The communist government's state council announced Thursday the removal of Jose Ramon Fernandez Alvarez as vice president of the council of ministers, according to state-run Granma. Fernandez, who is in his 80s, was the U.S.-trained head of the Cuban military force that defeated the U.S.-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs, said CNN analyst Carlos Alberto Montaner. Also removed from office was Jose M. Miyar Barrueco, who was minister of science, technology and environment, Granma reported. Miyar is considered the last Fidelista -- or loyalist to former Cuban president Fidel Castro -- in Raul Castro's government, Montaner said. Miyar was Fidel Castro's personal secretary, Montaner said. \"Publicly, Raul did not feel too comfortable with Miyar,\" Montaner said. \"Raul is completing the government with people who are close to him.\" Fernadnez and Miyar were assigned to other government posts, Granma said. Replacing Fernandez is Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez, an engineer in his early 50s who comes from the Communist youth party, Montaner said. Diaz-Canel who, was minister of higher education, Granma said, was replaced by First Deputy Minister Rodolfo Alarcon Ortiz, Granma said.

Sterling has confirmed it is his voice expressing racist views on audio of a private conversation that was leaked to the media. Some who have followed Sterling over the years say he had shown this side before and the leaked audio led to public outcry too loud for the NBA commissioner to ignore. But what of the recording itself? Was it legal to record? To leak? Here's a look at some of the legal aspects of the recorded conversation between Sterling and his alleged mistress, V. Stiviano, who said she recorded the conversation. Was it legal to record the conversation? It depends what state you are in during the conversation. Most states require that only one person have knowledge that a conversation is being recorded for it to be legal. But some states, like California, are \"two-party consent\" states where all of those involved in the conversation have to know they are being recorded for it to be legal. So depending on the location of the recording, if Sterling didn't know he was being recorded, the audio might very well have been obtained illegally. Stiviano's lawyer, however, told the Los Angeles Times that Sterling knew he was being recorded. The lawyer, Mac Nehoray, declined to tell the Times why Stiviano recorded the conversation, but said it was \"by mutual agreement,\" he told the Times. Banning Sterling good for NBA's bottom line .

        "Summarise the article:\n\nRustenburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Dozens of South African miners defied orders to work Friday after a deadline arrived for management to respond to their list of grievances. About 100 workers at Anglo American Platinum in Rustenburg refused to work and demanded that the company address the list submitted a week ago. The miners resumed work after management held talks with six people selected to represent the workers, the company said in a statement. The two sides plan to continue working on a resolution. What's behind the Marikana massacre? \"We are pleased that the meeting ended on a positive note and would like to applaud our employees for acting in a manner that assured their safety and that of their colleagues,\" the company said in a statement. It did not say whether the talks yielded any results. The incident marks the latest labor discontent in the nation's mining heartland in the northwest. South Africans held memorial services nationwide Thursday for victims of clashes at the Lonmin Marikana mine. The strikes started as protests demanding higher wages, but escalated into one of the worst incidents of violence in post-apartheid South Africa. The clashes left 44 people dead, including 34 killed when police opened fire on charging protesters on August 16. An additional 10 people, including police officers, died in days leading up to that. A rivalry between two unions that wield a lot of power and influence in the nation added to the tension. The unions, accused of trying to outdo each other in negotiating wages, denied instigating the clashes. In addition to the two companies, there are signs of labor discontent at nearby Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine. About 1,000 workers protested this week to voice their discontent over wages.

A tiny seahorse and the world's longest insect were among the top 10 new species discovered in 2008. These unusual critters were among thousands of species found last year, many in remote or tropical regions of the planet, that hint at the breadth of the Earth's undiscovered biodiversity. \"Most people do not realize just how incomplete our knowledge of Earth's species is,\" said Quentin Wheeler, director of the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University, which announced the top 10 new species list. \"We are surrounded by such an exuberance of species diversity that we too often take it for granted,\" Wheeler added. The ASU institute and an international committee of taxonomists -- scientists devoted to species exploration and classification -- compile the top 10 list of new species each year. Also on the 2008 list are a caffeine-free coffee plant, a snail whose shell twists around four axes, a palm that flowers itself to death and microscopic bacteria that live in hairspray.

Then her father passed away and Murray, the youngest of his four children, stepped up. She became the first female president of Liberty Industrial Gases and Welding Supplies Inc. in Brooklyn. \"I grew up working in the business, all of my siblings did. We would file, paint cylinders and work in the store.

The procedure and the treatments that followed left her fatigued, nauseated and in so much pain that she couldn't pick up her 1-year-old daughter or do simple household chores. She also struggled with depression because she needed constant child-care assistance. \"It's really hard to ask for help,\" Haley recalled. \"You want to be competent and independent. ...

            "By . John Stevens . Stephen Crabb has become the first Conservative cabinet minister with a beard for more than a century after being promoted to Welsh Secretary. A bearded Tory has not sat at the cabinet table since William Hillier Onslow, the 4th Earl of Onslow, who was president of the board of agriculture from 1903 to 1905. Mr Crabb, who is the MP for Preseli Prembrokeshire and was first elected in 2005, has neatly trimmed facial hair, which is in contrast to Lord Onslow\u2019s fuller whiskers. Scroll down for video . Stephen Crabb's promotion to Welsh Secretary makes him the first hirsute man in Cabinet since William Hillier Onslow, the 4th Earl of Onslow .

The 41-year-old replaces David Jones who was sacked in the reshuffle. Mr Crabb had been his deputy at the Wales Office and was previously a government whip. The father-of-two was raised by a single parent in a council house. Before election, he worked as a marketing consultant.

Sherrie Rhoades, 44, was attending a tribal eviction meeting at the Cedarville Rancheria tribal office Thursday around 3:30 p.m. when she opened fire, Barnes said. When Rhoades ran out of ammunition she grabbed a butcher knife from the kitchen and attacked another person, stabbing them, Barnes said. A person at the meeting ran out of the building covered in blood and went to the Alturas police station to alert officers, Barnes said. Police said they found Rhoades outside the building, running with a knife in her hands. She was taken into custody. The deceased victims were identified as a 19-year-old woman, a 45-year-old woman, a 30-year-old man and a 50-year-old man. Rhoades, a former tribal leader, was at the hearing because she was facing eviction, police said. The shooting happened in Modoc County, which is in Northern California on the Oregon border.

Intercourse between two men -- or two women -- remains a sin. \"Homosexual genital acts fall short of the Christian ideal and are to be met with a call to repentance and the exercise of compassion,\" according to Anglican doctrine. Men and women in same-sex unions were already allowed to serve as priests in the Church of England, but there was a moratorium on advancement to the episcopate -- becoming a bishop -- while the church considered the issue. The church announced Friday that if men in celibate civil unions may be priests, then there is no reason for them not to be bishops, as long as they are \"living in accordance with the teaching of the Church on human sexuality.\" Any priest looking to become a bishop must undergo a thorough examination of \"personal and family circumstances,\" according to a statement released by the House of Bishops of the Church of England. Female priests are barred from advancing to the position of bishop, as a vote on the measure in the church failed to pass lay approval last November despite an overwhelming majority of support within the church hierarchy. Women have been permitted to enter the priesthood since the early 1990s. The church defines marriage \"as a faithful, committed, permanent and legally sanctioned relationship between a man and a woman, is central to the stability and health of human society.\" It believes sex should be practiced exclusively within a marriage. The British parliament is expected to consider legislation allowing same-sex marriage, but the Church of England and the Church in Wales would be prohibited from performing wedding ceremonies as long as it remains against canon law.

Even as it targeted its domestic enemies, the Tripoli government continued to parry with leaders around the globe. Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim, for instance, said Friday that Libya has suspended diplomatic relations with France, one day after the French government recognized the newly created Libyan opposition movement as the sole representative of the country. In Ras Lanuf, pro-Gadhafi forces cranked up an intense and steady bombardment of the city, believed to be by rocket, artillery and tank fire. A storage tank at an oil refinery was on fire after an air raid there. \"We saw a bomb fall about a kilometer to the southwest of the refinery, and moments later saw thick black smoke rising from the refinery. We don't know, and no one we spoke to could say with any level of certainty or veracity, what caused the fire,\" said CNN Correspondent Ben Wedeman. Dozens of pickup trucks and cars belonging to the opposition were heading away from the city amid fear that Libyan forces were advancing as the bombardment continued. The rebels evacuated to a checkpoint outside the town, but that and other rebel positions also were targeted by airstrikes. Rebels said the eastern city has been essentially empty as civilians fled and opposition forces retreated from sustained attacks. On Thursday, state media said the town was \"cleansed\" of the fighters. This reflects the turn in fortunes for Gadhafi's well-equipped military, which has gained an upper hand after rebel fighters seized ground across Libya.

Al-Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity relating to a five-year campaign of violence in western Sudan's Darfur region. And Nigeria, as party to the treaty that created the criminal court, is obliged to cooperate, Amnesty said. Nigerian officials could not immediately be reached for comment. \"The Nigerian government has an unconditional legal obligation to arrest President Omar al-Bashir and hand him over to the ICC, should he enter Nigerian territory,\" the group said. \"Any failure to fulfill obligations under international law and may amount to obstruction of justice.\" The group said Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua invited al-Bashir to attend the African Union Peace and Security Council in the capital, Abuja. The International Criminal Court issued the warrant against al-Bashir in March. It was the first ever issued for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal, based at The Hague in the Netherlands. The warrant covers five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape. It also includes two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging. Al-Bashir remains president and has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur, and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes. Sudan denies the death toll is that high.

The club-record \u00a310million signing said: \u2018In Nigeria, Kanu is one of the big players who everybody looks up to, so I am happy that we talk.

A \u00a33.8m transfer to Qatari side Al-Gharafa had been agreed following an underwhelming six months in which he scored two West Brom goals.

Perhaps the line of questioning is understandable given that just a short drive away is Dzeko's home city of Sarajevo, where the national hero lived throughout the Bosnian War which raged between 1992 and 1995. The war in Bosnia left tens of thousands dead, and hundreds of thousands displaced. But just as the bullet holes which still riddle this land represent a gruesome past, Dzeko and his teammates have become symbols of a different more optimistic future. For the first time in its short history, Bosnia is off to the World Cup. \"I never thought I would be where I am now,\" Dzeko, who played a key role in Manchester City's 2013-14 English Premier League title triumph, told CNN. Dzeko's early years were played out against the devastating backdrop of the consequences of a brutal internecine conflict. \"I started to play football when I was about 10, my father brought me to one school because there were more pitches where we could play. Everything was destroyed after the war.\" In previous interviews Dzeko has spoken of how his family home was destroyed and he was forced to live in his grandparents' house with 15 of his relatives. His mother once inadvertently saved his life, calling him inside seconds before the land he was playing on was hit by bombs. The siege of Sarajevo followed the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, with conflict erupting between the ethnic groups which make up Bosnia -- chiefly Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs. Modern-day Bosnia is an independent state, although still under international administration. \"I was here all the time during the war and I know what it is, but I think we came out stronger,\" explains Dzeko. \"We want to show the world that even if you go through some bad periods, you always have to think positive just to go...",

A Tennessee newspaper editor has been fired after writing a headline critical of President Obama.

The timing of the column gave it a national audience it might not otherwise have had. As a result, it went viral online and Johnson,  the editor of the Times Free Press editorial page, has since been let go. Drew Johnson says he was fired from his job as an editor for the Chattanooga Times Free Press for writing an anti-Obama headline on an editorial . The newspaper said it fired Johnson for violating a policy requiring that last-minute changes to headlines be approved by upper management.

            "(CNN) -- Harvard is caught up in a student cheating scandal that its dean of undergraduate education calls \"unprecedented in its scope and magnitude.\" As a Harvard grad, I am embarrassed, but what has me really worried is that Harvard, despite officials acknowledging the seriousness of what has happened, gives signs of trying to finesse the consequences of the scandal where key athletes are concerned. The scandal centers on 125 students, as many as half of them varsity athletes from the men's basketball, baseball and football teams, according to The Boston Globe. They stand accused of copying from one another or plagiarizing on a take-home exam in a spring 2012 government course, \"Introduction to Congress,\" with an enrollment of 279. At Harvard the standard penalty for cheating is that a student can be asked to withdraw from the university for a year. In the case of athletes, withdrawal means the loss of a year of athletic eligibility, according to the NCAA, if they are forced to leave after they have registered for classes. Harvard is seeking to avoid that problem. The secretary of Harvard's Administrative Board, the body that rules on individual cheating cases, sent around an internal e-mail to resident deans saying that fall athletes might \"consider taking [a leave of absence] before their first game.\" The internal e-mail, obtained by The Crimson, Harvard's student paper, and confirmed by a resident dean, sends a clear message. You may be guilty of cheating, but here is a strategy for reducing the damage you suffer to a year's unpaid vacation. This advice may be Harvard's idea of academic integrity, but it certainly falls short of what a university should aim for. Fortunately, there is an example Harvard might learn from -- that of West Point, which in 1951 experienced a massive cheating scandal that involved a disproportionate number of athletes. On August 3 that year, West Point announced that it was expelling 90 cadets, including the son of its legendary football coach, Earl \"Red\" Blaik, for cheating on..."

But Chavez ordered investigators to exhume the body of the former military leader and determine whether he was murdered. \"Bolivar is alive. Let us not see him as a dead man and let us not see him as a skeleton. He is like lightning, like a sacred fire,\" Chavez said. With the national anthem playing in the background, a group of scientists wearing white coats rolled up a black cloth, revealing a skeleton on the table below. The broadcast then faded to black, showing Chavez singing along to the national anthem. A DNA test will be performed on the remains as well as the clothing items found inside the tomb, Chavez said. He said on his Twitter page that he cried when he first saw Bolivar's remains Thursday. Chavez has credited Bolivar with inspiring him as \"the father of the revolution.\" In 1819, Bolivar founded Gran Colombia, a federation of what is now Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador. He led the armies that liberated Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru and Venezuela from the Spanish crown and is credited with spreading democratic principles in Latin America.",

Establishment Republicans are being challenged by insurgents hoping to purify the brand and return the GOP to small government, free market principles. The conservative grassroots are organizing this election season to elect their preferred, ideologically pure candidate, even if that means unseating House and Senate incumbents. It's a strategy they had in 2010 and 2012 with mixed results. But too much emphasis might be placed on the internal strife. Because if money has anything to do with it, which it does, the battle is more like a fight between David and Goliath. Republican establishment chooses electability over purity . The three main groups working to unseat a handful of incumbents are the Senate Conservatives Fund, Club for Growth and FreedomWorks. A few of the incumbents they want to unseat: Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the chamber's Republican leader, and Thad Cochran of Mississippi. Also on their list is Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho. McConnell's re-election bid one of the key 2014 races . They have raised a nice chunk of cash. Combined, the groups' super PACs, which have different agendas and are only being lumped together because of their influence and effectiveness and their ability to raise unlimited amounts of campaign cash, have spent about $15 million in the past 15 months. That's not an insignificant amount and that's a good portion of the nearly $50 million spent by all outside groups combined this midterm election season. But Robert Maguire of the Center for Responsive Politics said campaign spending is already ahead of this point in 2012, the most expensive campaign season in history. \"No matter of how you look at it, we're well ahead of where we were at the last midterms and also the last election,\" he said.

But Las Vegas, Salt Lake City and even Fairbanks are also offenders. Part of the problem stems from policy failures in Washington. Of course, local governments are at fault as well. In California, cars and trucks contribute heavily to the problem, as is also true in cities like Dallas. LA pioneered urban sprawl and the car culture and is now paying the price. But it's not alone: Atlanta, Charlotte, and others are also sprawled across the countryside. American cities have not done enough to get people out of cars and onto mass transit. LA exemplifies the problems. As detailed in \"Railtown,\" a recent book by Ethan Elkind, LA focused too much on subways and not enough on trolleys and dedicated bus lanes. To make matters worse, the routes were often in the wrong places due to political interference from the city council through the state capital to Congress. It's not realistic to expect that something as major as transportation infrastructure will be immune from politics, but rational planning needs to play a bigger role than it has in the past. LA's specific problems were its own, but mass transit is in need of more support and better implementation across the nation. All too often, support for mass transit is portrayed as a wasteful subsidy because its benefits to the public are misunderstood. The federal government has sometimes failed to do enough to fight air pollution. Under the Bush administration, especially, industry succeeded in using federal laws as a shield against state regulation. For instance, cities have been blocked from addressing pollution from older, dirtier trucks. When one port authority tried to prohibit dirtier trucks from using its facilities, the Supreme Court held this effort violated a federal law deregulating prices and routes in the trucking...",

            "(CNN) -- Two cabin crew and six passengers were hospitalized after a Cathay Pacific flight hit severe turbulence as it passed over Japan yesterday. The aircraft, a 747-400 flying as flight CX879 from San Francisco to Hong Kong, flew into turbulence early Tuesday, six hours before it was due to land at Hong Kong International Airport. \"Regrettably, two cabin crew and a number of passengers were injured in the incident,\" Cathay Pacific said in a statement. \"Those injured were given preliminary treatment during flight. Medical assistance was provided for the injured passengers and cabin crew immediately upon arrival. \"After initial medical examination, two crew and six injured passengers required further examination and treatment at hospitals while one passenger with minor injury was released.\" The South China Morning Post reports that one crewmember was seen heading to the hospital in a neck brace and wearing an oxygen mask. It quotes a passenger as saying: \"It was even more intense than sitting on a roller coaster.\" Earlier this week, five people were injured when a United Airlines flight hit turbulence. Last year, a similar incident on a Singapore Airlines flight during meal service was caught on camera and spread around the Internet. Turbulence is the most common cause of injuries in flight, though severe turbulence, which can force aircraft to deviate in altitude by up to 100 feet, is rare. The website Airsafe.com claims to have identified six fatalities caused by turbulence. Cathay added that it's collaborating with the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department as they investigate this latest incident."

The 23-year-old broke down as she celebrated her second grand slam title, denying her Chinese opponent her second after coming from behind to triumph 4-6 6-4 6-3 and claim the $2 million first prize. The Belorussian went into the match having upset local fans after taking a controversial 10-minute medical break during a key point of her semifinal win over American teen Sloane Stephens, but this time she was forced to wait as Li twice had to receive lengthy treatment. The match was also interrupted in the deciding set by a break for the traditional Australia Day fireworks. \"It's been a real long two weeks,\" Azarenka said on-court after winning in two hours and 40 minutes. \"I will always keep very special memories of this court. It will be in my heart forever.\" Li, the losing finalist in 2011, raced to a 5-2 lead in the opening set as she made a strong bid to add to her French Open title that same year -- a breakthrough win that made her the first Asian female to win a grand slam singles title. However, she was unable to show the same control that had allowed her to thrash world No. 2 Maria Sharapova in straight sets in the semifinals. Azarenka led 3-0 in the second set, then sixth-ranked Li went over on her ankle after winning the next game. It looked like it might bring the final to a premature end but the 30-year-old got back on court after having her foot strapped and reduced the deficit further. However, Azarenka rallied to take the set and then broke Li's serve to lead 1-0 in the third set. Li broke back and then led 2-1 before the fireworks started in celebration of 225 years since the first fleet of colonists arrived from the UK. It was an inopportune break for Li, who again went over on her ankle and banged her head on the court as she tried to protect her damaged foot. \"For two seconds I couldn't really see anything.

Foreign Secretary William Hague and International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell traveled to Benghazi, where they reiterated support for the Transitional National Council. According to a statement, Mitchell announced new support for the clearing of mines in besieged cities, including Misrata. He and Hague visited a Benghazi hospital treating those wounded in the conflict. The visit, which included a discussion of the country's possible future, followed helicopter attacks by British and French forces on the regime's military. \"This successful engagement demonstrates the unique capabilities brought to bear by attack helicopters,\" said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, who commands NATO's Libya operation. \"We will continue to use these assets whenever and wherever needed, using the same precision as we do in all of our missions.\" British forces, flying from the HMS Ocean, used Apache helicopters for the overnight strikes, according to the Ministry of Defence. French helicopters took off from the assault ship Tonnerre, the ministry said in a statement. The Apaches struck a regime radar installation and a military checkpoint, both located around Brega, a key oil town in the east, British officials said. Hellfire missiles and 30mm cannon were used to destroy the targets, they said. Royal Air Force ground attack aircraft destroyed another military installation, while a separate mission hammered two ammunition bunkers in central Libya, according to the statement. A French military spokesman said 20 targets, including vehicles, were destroyed. Several helicopters responded to small-arms fire from the ground, but none were hit, he said. \"The use of attack helicopters provides the NATO operation with additional flexibility to track and engage pro-Gadhafi forces who deliberately target civilians and attempt...",

        "Sum the following article in brief: You may not have heard of Snapchat. But if there are teenagers or 20-somethings in your life, it's a safe bet that they have. Snapchat is a mobile app which lets users share images or videos that disappear after a few seconds. That's right -- they vanish forever in the time it takes you to read a tweet. In a little over a year since it was released by a Stanford student and his recently graduated business partner, Snapchat has has quietly amassed millions of users and now claims to process more than 30 million messages a day. Some bloggers have called it the \"next Instagram.\" Not bad for a mobile tool which, rightly or wrongly, is often cited for one very specific ability -- the \"sexting\" of naughty images to other users. In an age when young people are constantly being warned not to post inappropriate things online, Snapchat offers a degree of freedom by letting users share unfiltered thoughts or images without much fear of reprisal. \"Like most people born before the 1990s, I'm not a Snapchat user, and I've long assumed the worst about the app -- that combining cameras; young people; and secret, self-destructing messages could only mean trouble,\" wrote Slate's Farhad Manjoo last week. But increasingly, he writes, it appears possible that \"teenagers are more likely using the app to safely explore the sort of silly, unguarded, and sometimes unwise ideas that have always occupied the teenage brain ... in a manner that won't haunt them forever. In other words, they're chatting with Snapchat precisely because it's not like chatting with Facebook.\" Not to be outdone, Facebook last month actually launched a virtually identical social app called Facebook Poke, a mobile re-imagining of one of the site's earliest, and ultimately most ridiculed, features. But instead of siphoning users from Snapchat, Facebook's move appears instead to have launched the upstart app to new heights. Both apps let users send images or short videos and messages via their smartphones. The sender can choose how long the message will be...",

Rand Paul kicks off a three-day swing Monday across Iowa, holding campaign-style events and fund-raisers with local politicians as the potential Republican presidential contender barnstorms the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Paul's route will take him through nine cities from the state's western border to its eastern edge. The Kentucky Republican will also help the state Republican Party open multiple offices ahead of the midterm elections. \"It's very important for Sen. Paul to hear the concerns of average Iowans as well as job creators,\" said Steve Grubbs, Paul's chief Iowa strategist and a longtime political operative in the Hawkeye State. As Paul lays the groundwork for a potential presidential campaign, he has kept Iowa a top priority. This is his fourth trip there since the 2012 presidential election. Paul will leave the state on Wednesday, a day before the start of the Iowa State Fair, a popular venue for presidential hopefuls. A small swarm of other potential GOP contenders will travel to Iowa this weekend to attend a popular event for social conservatives. But Paul won't be there, preferring to give the candidates he's been helping some breathing room and allow them to be the focus. Poll: Republicans slightly behind Clinton in key 2016 states .

Uhuru Kenyatta became the country's fourth president after a prolonged election dispute that ended up in the Kenyan Supreme Court. Tens of thousands of people packed a Nairobi stadium Tuesday to watch the inauguration. Jackson, a former U.S. presidential candidate, attended the festivities as a private guest. Kenyatta, the 51-year-old son of Kenya's founding leader, won the election with 50.07% of the vote. His chief rival, Raila Odinga, won 43.31% of the vote. Odinga challenged the outcome in court, saying it was flawed and marred by technical problems. After the court upheld Kenyatta's election, Odinga offered the president-elect his congratulations. \"The court has now spoken,\" Odinga said. \"I wish the president-elect and his team well.\" Political dynasty . Kenyatta and Odinga are the sons of the nation's first president and vice president, respectively -- stirring memories of a political dynasty that dates back to the 1960s. Their fathers started out as allies in the quest for Kenyan independence from Britain.

Despite controversy over the recent election results, the mutual acceptance by the two sons could help restore the nation's image as a bastion of stability after disputed election results in 2007 led to bloody chaos.

Car builders such as Renault, Ferrari, BMW, Toyota and McLaren have used technology -- developed to make single-seater race cars as competitive as possible -- to enhance their road-car products. And who can blame them if you consider the performance such a machine can deliver to a driver? The average F1 car can reach 160km/h in under six seconds according to the official Formula One Web site and have top speeds in the region of 370 km/h. Going fast is one thing, stopping is another, and controlling such velocity requires carbon brakes which, in any given race, will have an operating temperature that is over 600 degrees Celsius. In general, the cars weigh around 600 kilograms in race trim, including the addition of KERS that some constructors use to increase performance. This system stores energy normally lost through braking and reuses it for speed boosts during the race. Watch out for KERS powered cars -- including the Mclarens, BMW Saubers and Renault -- using their boost as the lights go green to start this weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.",

            "Virgin Atlantic is scrapping its Little Red domestic service next year \u2013 just two years after it was launched. The British airline said on Monday that Little Red\u2019s short-haul flights between London Heathrow and Manchester, Edinburgh and Aberdeen will end because the subsidiary was not making a \u2018positive contribution\u2019 to the company. The Crawley-based carrier, co-owned by Sir Richard Branson and Delta Air Lines, said the decision followed a review of its network which has put a new emphasis on its transatlantic routes. Sir Richard Branson flashed his underpants when Little Red's inaugural flight arrived in Edinburgh in 2013 . Little Red will stop flying between London Heathrow and Manchester in March while its flights between Heathrow and Edinburgh and Aberdeen will stop in September. It was set up to act as a feeder to Virgin\u2019s transatlantic and international routes, but the airline said it did not provide enough traffic. Virgin Atlantic chief executive Craig Kreeger blamed the subsidiary\u2019s demise on the \u2018inadequate\u2019 number of runway slots made available by regulators. He said: \u2018While this challenged environment meant Little Red ultimately did not deliver the results we had hoped, this certainly will not dampen our enthusiasm to try new things in the future.\u2019 The airline also announced that it is on track to make a profit by the end of 2014 after two years of losses.

Arid Uka told interrogators that his aim was to kill American troops, said Boris Rhein, interior minister of the German state of Hesse, where the shooting took place. Two U.S. airmen were killed and two others were wounded in the attack Wednesday on a U.S. military bus at Frankfurt Airport, authorities say. The 21-year-old man said he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing a video on the internet the day before, which he claimed showed American soldiers raping Muslim women, according to a German intelligence official who viewed a record of the suspect's interrogation. The suspect confessed to the shooting, and said that he acted alone with no helpers, the German intelligence official told CNN on Thursday. He was friends on Facebook with several pro-al Qaeda extremists from a group based in Bonn, Germany, that is known to German intelligence officials, according to the official. That included links to an Islamic preacher named Pierre Vogel and someone named Nessery, who was arrested about two months ago in Afghanistan, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the investigation. Current indications are that the suspect radicalized quickly, the German official said. The gunman was a postal worker at the airport, but worked outside the secure area. The U.S. official said that Uka didn't appear to punch into work Wednesday -- having apparently canvassed the area beforehand, helping him get around the extensive uniformed and plain-clothes security that typically patrol the Frankfurt airport.

        [
            "(CNN) -- The new Razer Blade gaming-centric laptop is sleek and powerful, but it's not for every gamer looking to take their action on the go. The second-generation edition is an upgrade from the original, released in February 2012. Razer wanted to bolster the hardware specs without detracting from what makes the Blade unique in portable computer gaming -- its size. The first thing you notice about the Blade is how thin it is. A 17-inch, high-definition screen is housed in a case that is less than an inch thick and weighs 6.6 pounds. The matte black aluminum finish is in stark contrast to the neon green Razer logo and keyboard lighting. It is quite the eye-catching machine and will sit comfortably on your lap. What makes the Blade different than standard laptops is its unique Switchblade interface, which sits on the right-hand side of the keyboard. This LCD touchscreen acts as a traditional touchpad mouse for most options, but can be programmed depending on which game is being played. Ten lighted buttons can be programmed as macro game commands, allowing for handy use. Some game profiles (Team Fortress 2, Battlefield 3, Star Wars: The Old Republic to name a few) are already available and Razer says they are working to add more. The placement of the Switchblade to the right of the keyboard took some getting used to when I just wanted to use it as a touchpad. Frequently, my fingers would seek the touchpad below the keyboard before wandering off to the right. In game, the location was more familiar to me as I treated it more like a gaming mouse. The touchscreen can also act as a secondary, but very small, display. While social media apps were preprogrammed into the buttons, I wouldn't recommend trying to Facebook or tweet on it while gaming on the big screen. However, if you're looking for an edge, a YouTube video walkthrough of the game you're enjoying can be viewed in the small screen while you control the action on the big screen. The next thing you'll notice about the Blade is the lack of an optical drive...."

The shuttle docked with the space station at 3:44 a.m. ET. At the time of docking, both spacecraft were traveling 225 miles over the Caribbean sea near Caracas, Venezuela, NASA said. Commander Alan Poindexter and his crew completed the rendezvous without the use of the shuttle's Ku-band radar, relying instead on other navigation tools to precisely track the space station, NASA said. The Discovery's seven-person crew now joins the six-person space station crew for more than a week of work together. It will mark the first time four women have been in space at one time. Three women -- mission specialists Stephanie Wilson, Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger and Naoko Yamazaki -- comprise part of the Discovery's crew. NASA astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson is already at the space station. Discovery launched Monday morning from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

            "Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- A Cuban court has convicted 14 government officials and businessmen and a Chilean entrepreneur for corruption and bribery involving the state-owned airline and a tourism agency. Marcel Marambio, a Chilean businessman with close ties to the Communist government, was sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison for bribery, fraud and falsification of documents, according to a notice published in state media on Tuesday. Marambio was president of Sol Y Son, a tourism agency jointly owned by the Cuban state and Chilean investors. His brother Max Marambio, a long-time friend of Fidel Castro, was sentenced in absentia in a separate corruption trial earlier this year. The 14 Cubans, all employed by Cubana de Aviacion airline or Sol Y Son, were sentenced to between three and 10 years of prison. State media said they were convicted because they received \"cash bribes and personal perks\" but did not provide details about what they provided in exchange. Courts have launched a number of corruption cases since President Raul Castro assumed the presidency of Cuba in 2008."

More than 20 people were arrested -- 17 in Spain and 4 in the United States -- during the operation, more than two years in the making. Authorities accuse those arrested with participating in a drug money-laundering ring that spanned three continents. As U.S. authorities tell it, cocaine was smuggled in multihundred-kilogram quantities from Colombia to Spain, where it was processed and sold. The proceeds were then sent to a man, identified by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida as Alvaro Lopez Tardon, who would allegedly launder the money with the help of at least two co-conspirators. Tardon is thought to have received more than $26 million in drug proceeds from Spain between 2004 and the present, the attorney's office said in a statement. He is accused of working with his brother, Artemio Lopez Tardon, who reportedly lives in Spain. Among the group's favorite ways to launder money was through the purchase and sale of real estate and luxury cars, authorities said. They seized 21 properties in Spain, four in the United States and 60 cars, including one thought to be worth more than $2.8 million. Spanish police said they also seized some $35 million in cash, kept in 50- and 100-euro bills, in Madrid. \"From the beaches of Miami to the shores of Spain, the fight against crime has no boundaries,\" said Special Agent in Charge John V. Gillies of the FBI Miami Division in a statement. \"This is another outstanding example of an international partnership, this time with the Spanish National Police, that disrupted a major drug organization.\" CNN's Elwyn Lopez contributed to this report.",

Tourists from around the globe have flocked to Kenya to witness the herds streaming across the savanna and over the Mara River. Poachers set steel snares amongst the thorn trees to capture wildebeest headed on their annual migration. But now this annual migration is under threat from poachers. \"When the animals come into Kenya there is this big influx of poachers,\" says Brian Heath, CEO of the Mara Conservancy that manages animal protection in the border regions of the park. \"Unless we control it we are in danger of the number of animals being poached not being able to sustain the population.\" The conservation NGO depends on tourists to finance their anti-poaching operations. A portion of each tourist's entrance fee goes to their operations. They have had plenty of funding in normal years, but this is not a normal year in Kenya. The political violence stemming from Kenya's disputed election caused visitors to cancel their trips or look elsewhere for their vacation. And though the country has been peaceful for months, the tourists have stayed away. As a result, the Mara Conservancy is running at a massive shortfall and has had to scale back on anti-poaching efforts. The low numbers of tourists hurts the economy in Kenya, but it also puts the wildlife at risk.  Watch how poaching is threatening the wildlife of the Masai Mara \u00bb . \"If we cannot run our operations as normal, then we fear that poachers may invade the park, kill the animals and then at the end of the day we do not have animals. They will destroy the Mara,\" says Joseph Kimojino, one of the head rangers. It sounds alarmist, but the facts back him up. Every herd requires a critical mass to survive and to move. Experts believe that between 40,000 and 100,000 wildebeest are poached a year. If the poaching increases to a certain level, it could spell disaster. \"If the numbers of animals in the migration were to...",

The World No.1 dug deep from a set down and three all in the second against China's Li Na to reel off nine straight games to clinch the prestigious title, 2-6 6-3 6-0. \"I can't believe I won. I was so tired. Honestly, did I really win? Because she played so well,\" Williams said in her post match interview. \"I'm just overjoyed, to be honest,\" Williams added. \"It's really awesome. It's such a special moment. To finish the year No.1 in the world and win this title after 40 years of the WTA, it means even more.\" Williams had to grind out a three set semifinal win over Jelena Jankovic Saturday and fell a set down to her fourth seeded Chinese opponent in the final as the tiredness set in. Williams pulled 3-0 ahead in the second set, only for Li to win three straight games to level. A lesser player might have crumbled, but the 17-time grand slam champion took her game to another level and finished it off with her 30th winner of the match. Victory took her prize money for the season to a record $12,385, 572 and at 32 years and one month she is the oldest winner at the end of season championship. It was her 78th WTA career title and she shows no sign of letting up in her pursuit of records with the first grand slam of the 2014 season in Australia next January firmly in her sights . Li has also finished the season strongly, the first Chinese player to make the WTA Championships final.

Now the People's Liberation Army is also turning to the stock market to help propel China's ambitious naval expansion plans. Beijing's military spend, at $166bn last year, is second only to the US. The country has been ramping up its naval prowess amid territorial disputes in the South China Sea and other surrounding waters. But with its largest defence contractors still predominantly state-owned, China wants to push them closer to the private sector and on to public markets to foster their growth. Launching what it described as the start of a push to use capital markets to fund China's defence industry, state-controlled China Shipbuilding Industry Co, the country's biggest shipbuilder, said it would raise Rmb8.5bn ($1.4bn) through a private placement of shares to buy production facilities and equipment to make warships. Chinese investors cheered the prospect of being able to invest in the country's military-industrial complex, driving the Shanghai-listed shares of China Shipbuilding up by the daily limit of 10 per cent. Shares of other companies expected to benefit, such as Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries, a maker of large steel structures, also surged. The company itself was quick to tout the lucrative nature of military assets to investors. \"This will expand the range of investable assets in our capital market and will allow investors to enjoy the returns generated by high-end military products,\" it said in a statement to the stock exchange. China has ramped up its military spending since the 1980s, with its official defence budget increasing at a double-digit pace in every year but one over the past two decades. Its spending is still less than a quarter of the US which spent $682bn in 2012, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In recent years, China has placed extra emphasis on building up its blue-water navy -- a force capable of operating far from the country's shores. Mired in territorial...",

A wave of bombings came amid Eid festivities marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan. It followed a July that was the bloodiest in five years, when violence between Sunnis and Shiites -- both Muslim sects -- spun out of control. In a press release Saturday, the State Department said the attacks \"bear the hallmarks of suicide and vehicle attacks in Iraq over the past ninety days\" and said most of those attacks were committed by al Qaeda in Iraq, which is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. \"The United States has offered a $10 million reward for information that helps authorities kill or capture Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,\" the State Department said, referring to a reward that the U.S. embassy in Baghdad says has existed since 2011. \"This reward is second only to information leading to Ayman al-Zawahiri, the chief of Al Qaeda's network, and symbolizes our ongoing commitment to helping our partners in the region eliminate this threat from their territory.\" The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq, claimed responsibility for Saturday's attacks on Sunday. The statement, published on an al Qaeda website, said the attacks were in response to recent security force operations. \"The Islamic State mobilized part of its security effort in Baghdad, the southern states and others to deliver a quick message of deterrence on the third day of Eid al-Fitr to the animals of Rawafdh 'Shiite' and their government,\" the statement said. Saturday's death toll included reports by Baghdad police that at least 22 people were killed and more than 40 others wounded after eight car bombs exploded in Shiite neighborhoods.

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius, the South African amputee who is running in the 2012 Olympics on prosthetic legs, might be surprised to learn he is part of a history that traces back 3,500 years. Many ancient civilizations used prosthetic limbs made of wood and metal to get soldiers back into battle. They were also used for basic health reasons. For example, archaeologists have found two very old Egyptian artificial big toes that had been skillfully crafted. One toe was still fastened onto the right foot of the mummy of the daughter of an Egyptian priest, who may have suffered from diabetes. How good were the Egyptian prosthetics? Modern volunteers with similar amputations tried them on and reported the toes were both comfortable and highly efficient during walking. For most of history, prosthetic limbs were used primarily to restore function and secondarily to mimic the human form (one of the Egyptian toes even had a false toenail). In the 1980s, prosthetic limbs underwent a radical evolution when high-tech materials, sophisticated electronics, hydraulics and even microprocessor-controlled joints began appearing. Today, Pistorius' \"Cheetah\" legs are made of sophisticated curved composite carbon fiber that can handle fast running. There is no doubt that Pistorius, dubbed \"Blade Runner,\" is a world-class athlete. Born with missing fibulas, his legs were amputated below the knees as a baby. Pistorius holds the double-amputee world records for the 100-, 200- and 400-meter dashes, and he has performed well against able-bodied athletes in international competitions. He is also courageous and determined. In 2007, however, the International Association of Athletics Federations banned Pistorius from competing in able-bodied competitions after tests at the German Sport University showed the Cheetah blades allowed him to expend less energy than able-bodied runners. Pistorius assembled his own legal and scientific team and successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration in Sport. Further tests showed that Pistorius uses...",

There's almost a morbid NASCAR crash type curiosity about what comes next in a small Midwest town wracked by naked racism and police incompetence. But most of this curiosity is stoked by fear and ignorance about what Ferguson, Missouri, is actually like. If you know the real Ferguson, you already know why the riots happened, and you can predict what will happen once the grand jury makes its decision. A little background: I went to elementary school about 40 minutes south of Ferguson, in the St. Louis military suburb of O'Fallon. I'm pretty familiar with the area, a frothy mix of the South, the Midwest and the Rust Belt. While the black population in the St. Louis metro area has grown and moved out of the city, teachers, firefighters, hospital employees and most importantly cops in the suburbs are largely white. My school district didn't hire its first African American teacher until 1986, and my elementary school has never had a black teacher despite having a sizable number of African American students. This is the St. Louis area in a nutshell, black suburban expansion, slow white acceptance and a dull Midwestern peace as the first integrated generations live together. Unfortunately the image you get of Ferguson is perfectly encapsulated by this opening I saw from a national television reporter commenting on the fact that the median income is \"only\" about $37,000 and apartments rent for as little as $450 a month. National news reporters mostly from New York descended upon this town and when audiences in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Washington, Los Angeles or any of the other major cities in America hear $37K a year, it sounds like poverty wages and rents that resemble public..."

In an interview taped Saturday in Cairo, Egypt, that aired on CBS' \"Face The Nation\" Sunday, Kerry said some nations \"are clearly prepared to take action in the air alongside the United States and to do airstrikes, if that's what they're called on to do,\" but did not get more specific. Separately, a U.S. official traveling with Kerry told reporters, \"There have been offers to (U.S. Central Command) from Arab countries willing to take more kinetic actions,\" according to a pool report. On CBS, Kerry admitted that airstrikes alone will not solve the challenge of defeating ISIS, but he reiterated the administration's stance that there is no plan to put troops on the ground outside of local Iraqi forces and Syrian rebel groups. \"Well, we're not looking to put troops on the ground. There are some (nations) who have offered to do so, but we are not looking for that at this moment anyway,\" Kerry said. Integral to the White House strategy is an effort to train and equip Syrian rebel forces. On CNN's \"State of the Union,\" White House chief of staff Denis McDonough said: \"We have had a relationship with these fighters now for a couple of years. They're getting better and more capable. And what's most important here is that the Syrian opposition on the ground fighting ISIL can count on American and coalition airpower to supercharge their effort. That's important and that's ultimately going to be what is called for in this strategy.\" ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, is also known by the acronym ISIL. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who advocates using U.S. special forces if needed to fight ISIS, was harshly critical of the Obama administration on...",

As some retailers refuse to sell the latest issue, featuring a controversial photo of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on the cover, it seems inevitable that some people who might have picked up a copy now won't. But any immediate loss could be minuscule for Rolling Stone overall. And recent history suggests that the frenzy could ultimately help move copies. \"It is absolutely impossible to predict what newsstands sales are going to be,\" Rolling Stone Managing Editor Will Dana told NPR after the anger erupted. \"...

A risk taker, in 2008 Jama chose to open his first Somalia-based restaurant in Kilometer Four, a dangerous area in Mogadishu where battles would often rage between various factions fighting for control of the city. \"That is the only reason I opened it,\" says Jama, who grew up in Mogadishu before heading to the UK to study culinary arts. \"If I do, people are going to see; they are going to say, 'he has done it, why are we not doing it?'\" Read this: Holidays in Somalia, anyone? Jama realized that, despite more than 20 years of conflict, there was money to be made here. And now, five years on, Jama owns not one but five popular restaurants across the Somali capital, all of which sell fresh local foods to its growing middle class. But Jama's bold move was spurred on by more than just profits. His mission was to give his fellow countrymen, who'd been scarred by years of war, something greater than just good food. He wanted to offer a taste of normal life and a sense of hope for the future. \"The only reason why I came here is to change the lives of the people who don't have somewhere to work and people who have been locked indoors and they don't have anywhere to go and socialize,\" says Jama. \"Basically, what I am looking for is to show them, 'yes, you can laugh when you finish work, university, office work, wherever...",

        "Can you write an outline of the following article in a few points?\n\nArticle: (CNN) -- Four days before Baylor University basketball star Isaiah Austin hoped to be drafted into the NBA, his dreams of playing in the pros were extinguished by a rare genetic disease called Marfan syndrome. \"I had a dream that my name was going to be called,\" Austin told ESPN. But after a standard physical, test results revealed he had Marfan syndrome. \"They said I wouldn't be able to play basketball no more, at a competitive level. ... They told me my arteries and my heart are enlarged, and that if I overwork myself or push myself, my heart could rupture.\" Marfan syndrome is caused by a genetic mutation that leaves connective tissue in the body weak, according to the National Institutes of Health. The defective gene can also cause excessive growth of longer bones in the body, although it's not clear why this happens. People with Marfan syndrome are usually very tall and thin. They often have longer than usual arms, legs, fingers and toes, according to the NIH. Austin, at 7-foot-1, matches this description. The center from Arlington, Texas, revealed during his sophomore season at Baylor that he is blind in his right eye as a result of a detached retina he suffered as a teenager. He was expected to be the first partially blind player in the NBA. Eye problems are a common effect of Marfan syndrome. Curved spines, chests that stick out or sink in, flexible joints, and stretch marks not related to weight gain or loss are also visible signs of Marfan syndrome. Less visible, and often unnoticed until it's too late: weak parts of the aorta -- the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body -- which can tear or rupture. Leaky heart valves that can cause a heart murmur are also among the symptoms. As devastating as the news may be for Austin, getting this diagnosis now may be a lifesaver. \"People with Marfan syndrome can live a long life if they are diagnosed and treated with medication and, when necessary, surgery,\" Carolyn Levering, president and CEO of The Marfan Foundation, said in a...",

At least part of the frenzy is little more than marketing, he implied. \"It's certainly good for business,\" the president said, responding to a question about a spike in weapons sales and applications for background checks after the massacre at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School left 27 people dead, 20 of them children. \"Part of the challenge we confront is that even the slightest hint of some sensible, responsible legislation in this area fans this notion that somehow, 'Here it comes, everybody's guns are going to be taken away,'\" Obama said. Read more: Newtown searches for answers a month later . This week, the president is reviewing recommendations from a task force led by Vice President Joe Biden looking into ways to curb gun violence. Obama set up the group after December's carnage in Newtown and demanded reform ideas by this month. Obama said he expects to have a fuller presentation later in the week \"to give people some specifics about what I think we need to do,\" he told reporters Monday. While the final recommendations have not been made public, Biden has said he's found widespread support for universal background checks and restrictions on the sale of high capacity magazines, which gun-control advocates believe contribute to more bloodshed at mass shootings. Obama said he backs such measures as well as renewing the Clinton-era assault weapons ban that expired in 2004. Passing any legislation may not be easy: The influential National Rifle Association, among other gun rights groups, has vowed to fight any new gun restrictions -- like an assault weapon ban, which the group's president David Keene predicted Sunday wouldn't make it through Congress -- tooth and nail.

Haley just missed out on winning the nomination outright in the June 8 primary, capturing 49 percent of the vote in a four-candidate field. She was short of the 50 percent plus one needed to take the nomination. Once facing long odds for the GOP nomination, Haley rose in the polls thanks in part to endorsements by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. And unsubstantiated allegations by two other Republicans that they had affairs with Haley, who is married with children, most likely helped rather than hurt her campaign. So did a racial slur by a Republican state lawmaker at Haley, who is Indian-American and was raised Sikh, but became a Methodist at age 24. \"The unproven allegations and attacks against Haley actually played right into her message as a new kind of conservative,\" said CNN political producer Peter Hamby, who is in South Carolina reporting on the campaign. \"In fighting back, she was able to argue that establishment figures in the GOP were playing politics as usual and trying to stop a real reformer from taking charge in Columbia.\" If Haley wins Tuesday's runoff, she'll be considered the favorite in the general election against state Sen. Vincent Sheheen, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee. Haley would become the Palmetto state's first woman governor if elected in November.

        "Summarise the article:\n\nLONDON, England (CNN) -- The U.S. trade embargo on Cuba is endangering the health of millions by limiting Cubans' access to medicines and medical technology, human rights group Amnesty International alleged Wednesday. Amnesty International says the U.S. trade embargo is limiting Cubans' access to medical technology. An Amnesty report examines the effects of the sanctions, which have been in place since 1962. Amnesty International Secretary-General Irene Khan called the U.S. embargo immoral and said it should be lifted. \"It's preventing millions of Cubans from benefiting from vital medicines and medical equipment essential for their health,\" Khan said. The embargo restricts the export of medicines and medical equipment from the U.S. and from any U.S.-owned company abroad. Amnesty also called on President Obama to not renew the Trading with the Enemy Act, which is due for renewal on September 14. The Act has been reviewed by U.S. presidents on an annual basis since 1978. Amnesty said that while not renewing the Act would not in itself end the embargo against Cuba, it would send a clear message that the U.S. is adopting a new policy toward Cuba. In April this year President Obama lifted restrictions that had prevented U.S. citizens from visiting relatives in Cuba, and sending them remittances. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman would not comment on the report because she hadn't read it. However, she said, \"The president believes it makes strategic sense to hold on to some inducements we can use in dealing with a Cuban government if it shows any signs of seeking a normalized relationship with us and begins to respect basic human rights.\" The Amnesty report also cites United Nations data that says Cuba's inability to import nutritional products for schools, hospitals and day care centers is contributing to a high prevalence of iron deficiency anemia. In 2007, the condition affected 37.5 percent of Cuba's children under three years old, according to UNICEF.   Watch a report on Cuba's health care system \u00bb . Cuba...",

This is a new era for Alaska, and I look forward to working with Mark on the many issues that are important to our state. I am confident he will add a compelling new voice to the U.S. Senate,\" Palin said in a statement. Palin praised Stevens, saying his \"tireless efforts on behalf of the state he loves have benefited all those who call it home.\" With 100 percent of Alaska's precincts reporting, Begich, the mayor of Anchorage, had roughly 48 percent of the vote, compared with about 47 percent for Stevens, according to CNN's latest tally. He bested Stevens by 3,724 votes. Alaska Elections Director Gail Fenumiai said that 2,500 overseas ballots remain to be counted. The full results will be certified during the week of December 1. A recount could take place, however, if the vote difference between Begich and Stevens is less than 0.5 percent. Stevens could have also asked for a recount, regardless of the difference, if he pays for it himself. The results of this race have national implications as Democrats seek a filibuster-proof 60-member majority in the Senate.

            "Beijing, China (CNN) -- In a round-table meeting with government advisers and researchers of a government-run think tank on April 14, Premier Wen Jiabao enjoined them to listen to people's voices and relay these truthfully to top leaders. Wen's call to speak the truth comes at a time when the Chinese authorities are rounding up dissenters and muzzling whistle-blowers. A contradiction? Analysts say Wen's statement is designed to counter public scepticism and to warn officials against lying or pandering to higher ups. Others suggest it may just be part of Beijing's crisis management. A People's Daily commentary explains that Wen's appeal is meant to elicit accurate assessment of the situation so authorities can deal with problems effectively. \"I don't think it is in contradiction to the party's crackdown on dissents,\" says Wenfang Tang, a political science professor at Ohio University. \"Wen is trying to promote the legitimacy of the party, at least on the surface, whereas the dissidents want to destroy it.\" In recent years, China has seen communist governments in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan swept by political turmoil called the \"color revolution\". Beijing has also watched authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and North Africa toppled by popular uprisings. The fall of these regimes has raised the spectre of a Chinese \"jasmine revolution.\" That does not seem likely--yet. More than 30 years after Chairman Mao's death, the Communist regime has built one of the most successful authoritarian governments in the world, delivering double-digit economic growth while keeping its one-party grip. Still, China's leaders fear outbreaks of luan (chaos). \"They are not complacent,\" says a retired Communist Party official, who declined to be identified. \"They may disagree on the ways and means but they agree on one goal that anti-government acts will be nipped in the bud at all cost.

        "Sum the following article in brief: This is the place where the Queen Mother exchanged nods with a complete stranger who was sitting in a warm bath. It was where Princess Margaret allegedly took cocaine with the Rolling Stones at a concert, and where a young Cliff Richard had announced he had found Christ at a Billy Graham \u2018crusade\u2019. Oh yes, and in 1896 Buffalo Bill Cody put on his Wild West Show there. But now the bulldozers are growling with impatience. Soon the demolition men will be moving in. With an \u00a38 billion project at stake \u2014 now that London Mayor Boris Johnson has given the scheme his blessing \u2014 they will not take long to reduce to rubble the art deco fa\u00e7ade famous around the world and the vast buildings on 77 valuable acres behind it. Progress, if that is the right word, comes in many guises. In this instance, Earls Court exhibition centre, for more than a century a palace of excitement and dreams in the heart of London, is coming down to make way for \u2014 but you already knew \u2014 town houses and flats.

        "Sum the following article in brief: (CNN) -- Mexican authorities say they've detained the father-in-law of one of the country's most wanted drug lords. Police Tuesday morning detained Ines Coronel Barreras, 45, on drug-related charges, officials told reporters. He is the father-in-law of Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, authorities said. In January, the U.S. Department of the Treasury described Coronel as a \"key Sinaloa cartel operative.\" Weapons and packets of marijuana were seized in Tuesday's operation, but no shots were fired, said Eduardo Sanchez Hernandez of Mexico's interior ministry. Authorities said Coronel is the father of Guzman's third wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, whom he married in 2007. Guzman's nickname, which means \"shorty,\" matches his 5-foot-6-inch frame, though he has climbed to great heights in the drug business. The Sinaloa cartel is one of Mexico's most powerful drug-trafficking operations, and Forbes has estimated Guzman's net worth at $1 billion. U.S. authorities arrested a woman believed to be Guzman's daughter in October. She was deported in December after she pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of a false visa. Coronel's arrest is one of the most significant blows to organized crime in Mexico since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December. The high-profile arrest comes two days before U.S. President Barack Obama is scheduled to arrive in Mexico. CNNMexico.com contributed to this report.",
