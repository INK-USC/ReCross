Because I work from 9:00 to 5:30, the only time I could go to the cinema was during my 45-minute lunch time.

By the time I saw one come around the corner, there was not enough time left to make the trip---- so I had to go back to the office. The same thing happened on Wednesday. On Thursday my luck changed, I got on a bus right away and arrived at the cinema in twenty minutes. But when I got there, I found a long line of people at the box office.

        "Read the article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Peter was getting ready to graduate from the college. He loved a beautiful sports car for many months, and knew his father could well afford it for him. He told his father all that he wanted.\nAs the graduation day was coming near, Peter had got nothing from his father. On the morning of his graduation, his father called him into his study. He told his son how proud he was to have such a good son, and told how much he loved him. Then he gave his son a beautiful gift box. He opened the box, finding a lovely book, a Bible , with the young man's name in it. Angrily he raised his voice to his father and said, \"With all your money you give me a Bible?\" He then ran out of the house, leaving the Bible.\nMany years later, Peter was very successful in business. He had a beautiful house and a wonderful family. Realizing his father was old, he thought he should go to see him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Unfortunately, he was told that his father had died.\nWhen he reached his father's house, he began to take care of his father's papers. And then he found the Bible, just as he had left it years ago. With tears, he opened it and began to turn the pages. As he was reading, from the back of the Bible dropped a car key. That was the key to the sports car he wanted so much. Sudden sadness and regret  filled his heart.\nSometimes we don't realize the good luck that we already have because we don't know the gift box is packed in a different way. The gift box may be the door to happiness. It is just waiting for us to open.\nQuestion: From the story, the writer wants to tell us   _  .\nOptions: A: we may miss good luck because they are not packed as we expect\nB: we should look after our parents carefully\nC: our parents will give us everything we ask for\nD: we should accept any gift that our parents give us",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article:\nArticle: When you are reading something in English, you may often meet with a new word. What's the best way to know it?\nYou may look it up in the English-Chinese dictionary. It will tell you a lot about the word: the pronunciation, the Chinese meaning and how to use the word. But how can you know where the word is thousands of English words? How to find it in the dictionary both quickly and correctly?\nFirst, all the English words are arranged  in the letter order. In the dictionary you can first see the words beginning with letter A, then B, C, D.... That means, if there are two words \"desert\" and \"pull\", \"desert\" will be certainly before \"pull\". Then if there are two words both beginning with the same letter, you may look at the second letter. Then the third, the fourth... For example, \"pardon\" is before \"plough\", \"judge\" before \"just\", etc.\nDo you understand how to look up in the dictionary?\nThe dictionary will be your good friend. I hope you'll use it as often as possible in your English study.",

I'm not a shy person, and I was very comfortable speaking to everyone. So I got lots of speaking practice. I also learned lots of interesting things about American culture. When I got home, my friends all said that I had improved so much! I hope to go back again in the future.\nCarla Fonseca - Rio de Janeiro\nI spent last year studying English in London. I'm from a small town, and London is a very big city. Sometimes I felt it was too big. There were so many people to talk to, but I always felt bad about my English.
