Secondly, the Chinese food is very delicious  and has many dishes. So Chinese people can keep fit and have white teeth. However, some people enjoy the western  food. Now many people, especially the workers in companies , are too busy to have lunch slowly so the western food meets their need and they can eat quickly. And the food is not too bad, too. It is a great pleasure  to try eating a different style of food. In my opinion, I like the Chinese food more than the western food. First of all I'm a Chinese and used to Chinese food, it can keep us healthy. On the other hand, the western food is high in fat, sugar and salt.

The family ate together at the dinner table every night. But the grandfather's trembling hands and poor sight made eating rather difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he drank milk, he spilled it on the tablecloth. The son and daughter-in-law became angry with him. \"We must do something about Grandfather,\" said the son. So the husband and the wife set a small table in the corner. There, the grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner at the dinner table. Since the grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl. Sometimes he had tears in his eyes as he ate alone. The four-year-old grandson watched it all in silence.\nOne evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood on the floor. He asked the child sweetly, \"What are you making?\" Just as sweetly, the boy said, \"Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and Mum to eat your food from when I grow up.\" The four-year-old boy smiled and went back to work. The words struck the parents and they were speechless. Then tears started to run down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done. That evening the husband took the grandfather's hand and gently led him back to the family table.\nThe wise parents should realize that the children are their parents' mirror.\nQuestion: Why did the old man live in his son's house?\nYes or no, is the answer \"Because he was so old and weak that he couldn't live alone.\"?",

Now however, doctors have begun to study laughter and the effects   it has on the human body. They have found evidence that laughter really can improve people's health.\nTests were carried out to study the effects of laughter on the body. People watched funny films while doctors checked their heart rate, blood pressure, breathing and muscles. It was found that laughter has similar effects to physical exercise. It increases blood pressure, the heart rate and the rate of breathing. It also works several groups of muscles in the face, the stomach and even the feet. If laughter exercises the body, it must be helpful.\nOther tests have shown that laughter appears to make the effect of pain on the body less. In one experiment doctors produced pain in groups of students who listened to different radio programs. The group which could bear the pain for the longest time was the group which listened to a funny program. The reason why laughter can make pain less seems to be that it helps to produce endorphins   in the brain. These are natural chemicals which make both stress and pain less.\nThere is also some evidence to suggest that laughter helps the body's immune system that is the system which fights infection  . In an experiment, one group of students watched a funny video while another group served as the control group -- in other words, a group with which to compare the first group. Doctors checked the blood of the students in both groups and found that the people in the group that watched the video had an increase in the activity of their white blood cells that is the cells which fight infection.\nAs a result of these discoveries, some doctors and psychiatrists   in the United States now hold laughter clinics, in which they try to improve their patients' condition by encouraging them to laugh. They have found that even if their patients do not really feel like laughing, making them smile is...\nQuestion: The main idea of this passage is that   _  .\nOptions: A: the doctors should learn how to make people laugh\nB: there are several ways of studying the advantages of laughter\nC: tests show that laughter can produce positive effects on human body\nD: laughter and physical exercise have the same effects on human body",

Unluckily, a lot of food that looks good may have pollution. Where is the pollution from? It has something to do with how people produce food: growing it on the farm, processing  it in factories, and making it ready for you to eat.\nHere's what happens:\nMost farmers use chemicals  to stop their crops from getting sick. Many of these chemicals remain in the food that you eat. Some people believe this may cause cancer. These chemicals may also pollute water and air, and kill animals and even people by accident.\nMost drinks are just flavored water  . Every drink coming in plastic bottles which you then throw away means a waste. Sugary drinks make you fat.\nIn the factories, much of what you eat and drink gets messed. Often things are put into food to make it delicious and look good but they might be harmful to people. And some food like meat often gets polluted by bacteria. What you can do:\nTry to get organic  food. Organic food doesn't have any ingredients  that are bad for the land, air or water. Don't eat processed food or drinks. Eat fresh food whenever you can and cook at home.",

When the English army invaded    Scotland, Bruce took up arms and led his people in defence of  his country.\nBattle after battle was fought, Bruce led his little army against the enemy, and six times his men were beaten. His army was scattered, and he was forced to go into hiding----in the woods or in lonely places in the mountains.

It seemed to him that it was no use trying to do anything more.\nAs he lay thinking, he saw a spider   over his head, trying to spin a web  . He watched as she worked slowly and with great care. Six times she tried to reach the opposite wall to fix her thread, but six times she failed.\"Poor thing,\" cried Bruce, \"You ,too, know what it is to fail.\"But the spider did not lose hope. With still more care, she tried for the seventh time. Bruce almost forgot his own trouble as he watched her swing herself out upon the thin line. Would she fail again? No, the thread was carried safely from one wall to the other.\"I, too, will try a seventh time,\" cried Bruce. He got up and called his men together. He told them his plans, and sent them out with message of cheer to his discouraged people. Soon there was an army of brave Scotsmen gathered around him. Another battle was fought.

        "The following are some tips for becoming a successful businessman by Michael Bloomberg. They are based on his experience of building a company from the ground  up, leading New York City as mayor , and so on.\nTake Risks\nLife is too short to spend your time avoiding failure.\nIn 1981, at the age of 39, I lost my job. The next day I took a big risk and began my own company. In 2001, when I was debating whether to run for mayor, most people advised me not to do it. But one person said, \"If you can imagine yourself giving a concession speech, then why not go for it?\" That was the best advice I received, and I followed it.\nIn order to succeed, you must first be willing to fail-- and you must have the  courage to go for it anyway.\nMake your own luck\nLuck plays a part in success. The harder you work, the luckier you get.\nWhatever you choose to do, even if it's not the job of your dreams, always work hard at it. Be the first person at work in the morning and the last to leave at night. Hard work creates chances.\nNever stop learning\nThe most powerful word in English language is \"why\". There is nothing so powerful\nas an open, inquiring mind . Whatever field you choose for starting a business -- be a lifelong student.\nGive back\nYou are responsible for your success and failure, but you only succeed if you share the reward with others.\nMy first donation was a $ 5 check to my alma mater   . And while the checks may be bigger today, they come with the same spirit.\nYou don't have to be wealthy to give back. You can give back by giving your time  and talents.\nWhat did the writer do at the age of 59?\nA) Lost his job.\nB) Ran for mayor.\nC) Built a company.\nD) Became a teacher.",

What is noise? Noise is a loud or unwanted sound. It is also called noise pollution.\nWhere is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise.\nWhat happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects.\nScientists use a unit  of measure  called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss.\nHow do we reduce noise damage? Turn down your music player or wear ear muffs  when you are working in a noisy environment. Ear muffs for human can protect against noise pollution.",

        "Article: Monkeys That Lend a Hand\nHave you ever dropped something while both your hands were full and wished you had another hand to pick it up? Some people cannot use their arms or hands to do simple jobs because they have been hurt or are sick. Usually they depend on other people to help them. This problem made two women think about how they could help people who cannot do everyday things for themselves.\nIn 1979 Dr. M. J. Willard and Judi Zazula began looking at some small, friendly monkeys called capuchin monkeys. These monkeys have hands like people's hands, and they like to be around people. Could the monkeys be trained to do things that people could not do for themselves? The women wanted to find out if their idea would work. So they spent a long time training some capuchin monkeys, and they found that these animals made great helpers.\nToday the first step in training a young capuchin monkey is to have it stay home with people and watch how they live. The monkeys learn how to _ around people. Then the monkeys go to a special school in Boston. There they learn how to do many easy chores. They are taught how to carry food and pick up dropped objects. They learn how to open doors and turn light switches on and off. They even learn how to use CD players and VCRs.\nAfter a monkey finishes its training, it goes to live with a person who needs help. If the person wants a light turned on, the monkey does it. If the person needs a glass of water, the monkey brings it. If the person wants to watch TV, the monkey turns it on. The monkey becomes a very important part of that person's life. In fact, the monkey often becomes the person's good friend.\nQuestion: What is the passage mainly about?\nYes or no, is the answer \"How capuchin monkeys can help people do things.\"?",

No matter which country you visit, no matter which grade you are in, you may not learn art, geography, chemistry or Chinese, but you always learn math. Why is this so? How come so many students hate math, and yet cannot avoid learning it in school?\nJenny Sanders, a high school student in California, asks, \"What good do we get from learning math? We can use computers to compute numbers, and we can use computers to store information. I think learning math at school is a waste of time.\"\nHowever, there is much more to math than just learning to add and subtract   numbers. In fact, math is not so much about calculation   as it is about learning to think logically   and solving problems. Of course, Jenny was right that we can use computers to do calculations, but how would we even know how to use the computer if we can't think logically? In short, computers are only tools when solving problems.\nFor example, imagine you are a cook and must serve dinner to 100 guests. How should you divide\nyour resources so that you can get the job done most efficiently  ? In situations like this, the ability to think logically will get you to a reasonable answer and solve your problem.\nQuestion: According to the passage, which subject do students always learn in different grades at school?\nOptions: A: Chinese\nB: Math\nC: Geography\nD: Art.",

This gas is a problem in all parts of the world that experience cold weather. A few years ago, America's Centers for Disease Control (C. D. C.) studied deaths linked   with carbon monoxide poisoning. It found that the number of carbon monoxide deaths in the United States was greatest in January. The C.D.C. also found that carbon monoxide kills more than four hundred Americans each year. And, it said more than twenty thousand people are taken to hospital for treatment of health problems linked with the gas.\nCarbon monoxide is called the silent killer because people do not know it is in the air. The gas has no color, no taste and no smell. It does not cause burning eyes. And it does not cause people to cough. Yet, carbon monoxide gas is very deadly  . It steals the body's ability to use oxygen.\nCarbon monoxide makes it difficult for the blood to carry oxygen to body tissues  . It does this by linking with the blood. When the gas links with the blood, the blood is no longer able to carry oxygen to the tissues that need it. Damage   to the body can begin very quickly from large amounts   of carbon monoxide.\nHow quickly this can happen depend on how long a person is breathing the gas and how much gas he or she breathes in.\nCarbon monoxide poisoning has warning signs . But people have to be awake to realize them. Small amounts of the gas will cause a person's head to hurt. He or she may begin to feel tired. Their stomachs may feel sick. The room may appear to be turning around. The person may have trouble thinking clearly.\nPeople develop serious headache as the amount of the gas continues to enter their blood. They will begin to feel very tired and sleepy. They may have terrible stomachache.\nDoctors say carbon monoxide influences people differently. For example a small child will experience health problems or die much sooner than an adult. The general health of the person or his or her age can also be important.\nQuestion: One of the signs of carbon monoxide poisoning is   _  .\n- burning eyes\n- bad cough\n- serious headache\n- high fever",

That's how millions of people start their day at Laughter  Clubs around the world and many doctors now think that having a good laugh might be one of the best ways to stay healthy.\nThe first Laughter Club was started in Mumbai, India, in 1995 by Dr. Madan Kataria.\"Young children laugh about 300 times a day. Adults laugh between 7 and 15 times a day,\" says Dr. Kataria. \"Everyone is naturally good at laughing -- it's the common language. We want people to feel happy with their lives.\" There are now more than 500 Laughter Clubs in India and over 1,300 in the world.\nMany doctors are also interested in the effects  of laughter on our health. According to a 5-year study at the UCLA School of Medicine in California, with laughing there is less stress in the body. Laughter improves our health against illness by about 40%.\nSo what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to my nearest club in South London to find out. I was quite nervous at the beginning of the class, to be honest, I wasn't interested in laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking silly. Our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands and say \"ho ho ho, ha ha ha\" while looking at each other. However, our bodies can't tell the difference between real laughter and unreal laughter, so they still produce the same healthy effects.\nSurprisingly, it works! After ten minutes everybody in the room was laughing for real and some people just couldn't stop! At the end of the class I was surprised by how relaxed and comfortable I felt. So if you're under stress, then start laughing. You might be very pleased with the results.",

With any relationship, you need to let other person know how you are feeling. If you are not able to communicate, you _ .When you are mad at your parents, or anyone else, not talking to them doesn't solve anything.\nCommunication begins with the concerns   of another. It means that you can't just come home from school, go up to your room and take no notice to anyone. Even if you just say \"Hi\", and see how their day was for five minutes, it is better than nothing.\nIf you looked up the word \"communication\" in a dictionary, it would say \"the exchange of ideas, the conveyance  of information, correspondence  , means of communication: a letter or a message\". To keep a good relationship, you must keep communication strong. Let people know how you feel, even if it's just by writing a note.\nWhen dealing with parents, you always have to make them feel good about how they are doing as a parent. If you are trying to make them see something as you see it, tell them that you'll listen to what they have to say, and ask them politely to listen to you. Shouting or walking away only makes the situation worse.\nHere is an example: one night, Sophie went to a street party with her friends. She knew she had to be home by midnight after the fireworks, but she didn't feel she could just ask to go home. That would be rude. After all, they had been nice enough to take her along with them. Needless to say, she was late getting home. Her parents were mad at first, but when Sophie explained why she was late, they weren't as mad and let it go. Communication is the key here. If Sophie's parents had not been willing to listen, Sophie would have been in a lot of trouble.\nCommunication isn't a one-way matter: it goes both ways.

It's a mixture   of music from all of these places.\nIn West America, cowboys   had to take care of the cattle. They had to watch them all day and all night because the cattle sometimes ran away. A cowboy's life was lonely and dangerous. When he was alone in the desert   with the cattle, he drank strong coffee to stay awake at night. He sang about the stars and the moon, about his family and his friends. The cattle listened to the cowboy and went to sleep. They didn't run away if he sang beautiful songs.\nIn South America, many people came from Ireland and England. Other people came from France and Canada. They enjoyed their own kind of music. When they visited their friends and families on holidays like Christmas, they usually sang and played country music.\nAmerican country music describes   life.

For many people, the rickshaw in Kolkata has many advantages, When the traffic is bad, rickshaws find a way through the traffic. If your miss your bus and there aren't any taxis, you can always find a rickshaw in Kolkata. Rickshaws are from your house to the market and waits for you. Then he loads  all your things, drops you off outside your home and helps you unload, No other type of public transport offers this kind of service.\nFrom June to September, Kolkata gets heavy rain. Sometimes it rains for 48 hours without a break. In some parts of the city, the roads flood  , and anything with an engine  is useless, But the rickshaw drivers never stop working, even with water all around them.\nBut not everyone thinks rickshaws are a good thing. The local government want to ban rickshaws. They believe it is wrong for one man to pull another person when there is modern transport in the city. However, there is a problem with this plan. Many of the rickshaw drivers come from the countryside. The only job they can find in Kolkata is pulling a rickshaw, If the city bans rickshaws, these men won't have a job. So for the moment, the people of Kolkata still go by rickshaw.\nQuestion: What can we learn from the passage?\nYes or no, is the answer \"The rickshaw is still a part of public transport in Kolkata.\"?",

But if we watch them, we can see that they  have their ways of communicating  with each other.\nCan you see the rabbit's tail? When rabbits see this white tail moving up and down, they run away.

When a cobra  is angry, it raises its head and makes itself look powerful . This warns other animals. When a bee  found some food, it goes back to its home. It cannot 'tell' the other bees where the food is by speaking to them, but it does a little dance. This tells the bees where the food is.\nSome animals 'say' things by making sounds. A dog barks, for example, when a stranger comes near. A cat purrs when it is pleased. Some birds make several different sounds, evry sound has its own meaning.

The USDA has prepared a food guide to help people learn about which kind of food is the healthiest to eat. The food guide describes six main food groups: meat (like fish and chicken), dairy (like milk and cheese),grains (like bread and rice), fruit and vegetables. The last group is fats and sweets. The USDA also suggests how much of each food group is healthy to eat daily. Though this guide was prepared by the US government, it is very useful for people all over the world.\nAs a _ of years of study, we know that too much animal fat is bad for our health. For example, Americans eat a lot of meat and only a small amount of grains, fruit and vegetables. Because of the way they eat, they have a high rate of cancer and heart disease. In Japan, people eat large amounts of grains and very little meat. The Japanese also have a very low rate of cancer and heart disease. The Japanese live longer than anyone else in the world. However, when Japanese people move to the US, the rate of heart disease and cancer goes up as their eating habit changes. And as hamburgers, ice creams and other high-fat foods become popular in Japan, the rate of heart disease and cancer is going up there as well. People are also eating more meat and dairy food in other countries, in which the disease rate is going up along with the change of the way people eat. Doctors everywhere suggest people eat more grains, fruit and vegetables and less meat and dairy food.\nEating healthily is important for children as well as their parents. When parents have poor eating habits, their children usually do, too. After all, children eat in the same way as their parents. When parents eat healthy food, the children will learn to enjoy it, too. Then they will develop good eating habits.

The 16-year-old boy tried to imagine how serious the drought was for the students at that school. However, he realized it was more serious than he had imagined when he saw the sign \"DON'T wash clothes with water,or you will be punished . \"\nBecause of drought, the school has been short of water for a long time. Each student has only one bottle of water every day for washing and drinking. The drought has made the poor students much poorer.\nPeng is a student from Beijing Chaoyang Foreign Language School. He took part in the school's Rain & Bow Project from April 2 to 10.\nThe project idea came from Peng's principal . One day, she heard a sad story about Li Guoxian, a poor girl in the Mashan School,who stopped going to school because of drought. The principal started this project to help the school. In one day, 3,000 students made over 10,000 donations of water,books and clothes.\nPeng and other four students went to the Mashan School and gave the donations with five teachers. They visited poor families, made surveys and had classes at the school.\nDing Zhentao,16,was worried about the school's poor learning environment. \"The blackboards and playground are too _ to use,\"Ding said. \"Besides, there really aren't enough teachers. A teacher has to teach both history and English, and even the cook is a class teacher. \"\nAlthough life isn't easy, students at the school have a positive attitude towards life and they are quite willing to learn. That's what moved 16-year-old Chen Shi most.\n\"They sang their songs together as usual before class every afternoon. After class, the students asked us to tell them things about Beijing and our studies,\" Chen said. \"You can see the passion in them. I believe it will make a difference. Their futures will be bright. \"\n,.\nQuestion: How many people went to the Mashan School and gave the donations?\nOptions: A: Four.\nB: Five.\nC: Nine.\nD: Ten.",

The streets where they found her had been her home for many years. Her parents were unknown. They left her long ago. At the orphanage, the girl, like all the children there, was taught to read and write. While she was studying at the orphanage, she learned something else--to be independent . At twenty-one, she left the orphanage and began working as a secretary. And then, in 1975, while she was still working as an ordinary secretary, something special happened. She entered the Miss Hong Kong competition and won it. This was the turning point in her life. Now her name, Mary Cheung, was known to everybody.\nMary entered the competition because she wanted to show that orphanage girls could be something. Winning the competition gave her the chance to start a new life. This led her first into television and then into business as a manager. When she was working as a manager, she had trouble with her reports. \"My English just wasn't good enough.\" She says. Luckily, she had a boyfriend (who later became her husband) to help her.\nMary studied management at Hong Kong and graduated in 1980, She started her own business in 1985. But she did not stop developing herself. She then studied at the University of Hong Kong. Since 1987, she had spent a lot of time on photography. She has held several exhibitions of her work in many places---China, New Zealand and Paris.

A study which come out on China Health Monthly magazine this year showed that 40.74% of a sample of 1,306 Chinese students under age 15 has decayed teeth.\nFood that is rich in sugar increases the risk of tooth decay.

This causes crooked teeth.\nDon't worry. Here are some ways to keep your teeth healthy.\n*Brush at least twice a day in the morning and in the evening.\n*Learn to use dental floss . The floss gets rid of food that's hidden where your toothbrush can't get it.\n*Visit a dentist. He or she can check if you have any dental problems and help you clean your teeth.\n*Pay attention to what you eat. It's better to eat lots of fruit and vegetables instead of fries and drink water instead of soda.\n*Wear braces  to make your teeth straight and beautiful.\nQuestion: What's the strongest part in the human body according to the passage?\nOptions: A: Bones.\nB: Teeth.\nC: Head.\nD: Bactria.",

Can they or can't they?\nAlmost certainly, a machine can do any work in thinking that a person can do--if the correct way for doing the thinking work can be told exactly. Besides, many programs have been made to direct machines so that they work in very clever ways. Machines have been taught to play chess and to learn from what happens in the games so as to make their play better and better. Machines can beat many persons who play chess. Machines can translate from one language to another. They can prove statements in geometry  as taught in school. Machines can notice printed marks on paper, so that a person is no longer needed to look at the marks.\nComputers can be used in many ways, such as business, science, industry, and government. _ \nIf people cannot tell exactly the correct way to do certain work in thinking, it is still a question how much of _ a machine can do. Suppose a person is \"teaching\" the machine and telling the machine \"yes\" when the machine is right, and \"no\" when the machine is wrong. Then the machine can keep on searching among possible ways for solving a problem--until the machine can do as well as the person, and perhaps much better.\nBut, what is thinking? People can agree about much that is thinking, and much that is not thinking; but they can't reach agreement because the word \"think\" is not a scientific word with an exact meaning. A lot of the discussion is wasted breath because the persons are using different meanings of the word \"think\".\nPeople, however, have only had experience with machines that appear to think since 1944.\nIt would be too early to say that after the next 200 years, machines will not be thinking.

Have you ever copied someone else's work on an exam? Don't do it again! That's not something that an honest student should do.

April is Bird Loving Month in China. Is your school doing anything to celebrate it? You should join! That way, you can learn more about animals and how to protect them. When more people work together, it is more fun for everyone.\nHave you fought with your teammates when your basketball team lost? Only working together can make your team stronger. Be friendly to the people you are with. Try to think of others, not only yourself.\nBe open to new ideas. Have you ever thought that people could live on the moon? Maybe you'll discover Earth II someday. Don't look down on new ideas. Everyone's ideas are important. You should welcome them because new ideas make life better for everyone.\nProtect yourself. Has someone ever taken money from one of your classmates? Don't let it happen to you. If you have to go home late, you should let your parents know.\nUse the Internet carefully. The Internet can be very useful for your studies. But some things on the Internet aren't good for kids, do try to look at _ pages that aren't good for you. You can use the Web for fun or homework. Can't you find any good Web sites for children?

The box was marked \"To be opened after midnight, December 31st, AD 2000\",and was kept in the Colorado College Library.\nOne hundred years later, on the appointed  day, 300 people gathered to watch the opening of the box. Many in the crowd were the descendants  of people who had placed things inside the box.\nWhen the box was opened after midnight, the things inside the box were in very good condition. There were newspapers, photos, diaries, name cards, family trees, books and lots of letters, including one written by Theodore Roosevelt, who became the President of the USA later that year. One of Roosevelt's friends lived in Colorado Springs at that time.\nMany of the letters were written to their descendants. They describe the hopes that the people of 1901 had for the people of the next century. At that time, Colorado Springs had just a few thousand people. Now nearly half a million people live there.\nColorado College Library has scanned the materials and put them on a website. Cecil Muller, whose grandfather had placed a collection of postcards in the box, said that the time capsule was a great treasure. \"This is a wonderful educational resource .  We can learn so much about our history,\"he said. \"I never knew my grandfather, but now I feel very close to him. \"\nQuestion: Cecil Muller says that the time capsule   _  .\nOptions: A: helps him to get to know his grandfather\nB: is worth a lot of money\nC: brings back his memories of his grandfather\nD: helps him to remember his younger day",

It was first discovered by a young Swiss doctor in 1868.\nDNA is like a computer program for your body. Almost every cell  in your body includes DNA. The way DNA in the cell decides why you are the way you are. For example your friend might have larger ears than you. This is because their DNA is different from yours.\nDNA lives in the cell and is ordered in a structure called a \"double helix \". In each double helix there are links called as chromosomes . These chromosomes are made from four bases that arrange themselves in millions of different ways. The way these bases choose to line up is what makes the DNA code for that cell.\nDNA is also called a \"gene \". This is a very interesting thing. Genes are passed down from your parents. That is why you might have the same smile like your dad's or mom's!\nIn February, scientists found the skeleton  of Richard III, King of England from 1483-1485, under a car park in England. It seems unlikely that scientists could identify a 527-year-old skeleton. However, they matched the skeleton's DNA to a sample from one of his direct descendants .

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: It's interesting that the arrival of snow has a different effect on people in different countries. For some countries it is an important happening to celebrate each year, while for others it is a catastrophe   or even a wonder.\nThere are countries between these two extremes   that normally expect snow some time over the winter months, but never receive snow regularly or in the same quantities  every year. Britain is one such country, for which the arrival of snow quite simply creates problems. Within hours of the first snowfall, however light, roads are blocked, trains and buses stop in the middle of traffic. Normal communications are affected as well, telephone calls become difficult and the post immediately takes more time than usual. Almost within hours, there are also shortages  -- bread, vegetables and other things -- not because all these things can no longer be produced or sent to shops, but mainly because people are frightened, and go out to store up these commodities  , \"just for fear that something bad should happen.\"\nWhy then does snow have this effect? After all, the Swiss, Austrians and Canadians don't have such problems. It is simply because there is not enough planning and preparation. We need money to buy equipment to deal with snow and ice. To keep the roads clear, for example, requires snow ploughs and machines to spread salt. The reason why a country like Britain does not buy some ploughs is that they are only used for a few days in any one year, and the money could be more useful in other things such as hospitals, education or helping the old.\nQuestion: The arrival of snow in Britain affects all of the following except  _\nOptions: A: traffic\nB: communication\nC: food supplies\nD: service quality",

Just two months later, thieves stole the dog, and now the heartbroken little boy is back to where he started. He has refused to talk since losing his best friend. His mother was worried and gave him another dog, but he just \"pushed it away\". Mrs Hainsworth, his mother, says, \"My son is very sad. He'll go over to her cage and just beat  on the bars.

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article:\nArticle: When women sit together to watch a movie on TV, at the same time they usually talk about a lot of subjects, including children, men, careers and what's happening in their lives. When groups of men and women watch a movie together, the men usually end up telling the women to shut up. Men can either talk or watch the screen---they can't do both---and they don't understand that women can. Besides , women think that the point of all getting together is to have a good time and develop relationships--not just to sit there like couch potatoes staring   at the screen.\nDuring the ad breaks, a man often asks a woman to explain the plot(the story that is told in a novel or play or movie etc.) and tell him where the relationship between the characters is going. He is unable, unlike women, to read the small body language signals that show how the characters are feeling emotionally . Since women originally spent their days with the other women and children in the group, they developed the ability to communicate successfully because they want to keep relationships. For a woman, speech continues to have such a clear purpose: to build relationships and make friends. For men, to talk is to connect to the facts.\nMen see the telephone as a communication tool for sending facts and information to other people, but a woman sees it as a way of keeping relationship. A woman can spend two weeks on vacation with her girlfriend and, when she returns home, telephone the same girlfriend and talk for another two hours.\nThere is no convincing evidence that social conditioning, the fact that girls' mothers talked them more, is the reason why girls talk more than boys. Psychiatrist Dr. Michael Lewis, author ofSocial Behaviour and Language Acquisition, conducted experiments that found mothers talked to and looked at baby girls more often than baby boys. Scientific evidence shows parents reply to the brain differences of their children. Since a girl's brain is better organized to send and receive speech, we talk to them more. As a result,...",

Scientists explain that the outside of the earth is made of a number of different plates . For example, at San Francisco the Pacific  Plate which is moving towards the northwest meets the North American Plate. The Pacific Plate is moving very  slowly-at 5. 3 centimetres a year. Sometimes these two plates stop and do not move for years. Then suddenly, they jump and an earthquake is felt. As the movement of these plates, West America near the sea has always been a bad place for earthquakes. When the 1906 earthquake happened, the Pacific Plate jumped 5-6 metres to the north.\nWe cannot stop earthquakes, but we can do things to make sure they don't destroy  the whole of cities. First ,it is not a good idea to build houses along the lines, where two of the earth's plates join together.

The main reasons for this are:\n* People are doing less hard physical work\n* More people worldwide now eat too much fatty food\n* Too many people are driving cars instead of walking\n* People spend too much time in front of a television\nThe United States has the highest rate of obesity in the developed world and Japan has the lowest. Professor Benjamin Senauer is absolutely certain of the reasons for this.\n\"Japanese people are fit. They use public transport and walk,\" he said. \"The average American drives to work and drives to supermarket. When he gets home, he sits on a couch in front of the TV and eats junk food.\"\nIn Britain and many other European countries, there are three times as many obese people as there were 20 years ago. About two thirds of British adults are overweight or obese. \"The effects of this are clear,\" said London doctor Elena Power. \"We have more illnesses related to weight and fewer fit people.\nChina used to be one of the slimmest nations in the world. However, Professor Wu Yangfeng from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in Beijing recently estimated  that 20 percent of the world's overweight people live in China. The Chinese government is especially worried about the increase in obesity among schoolchildren.\n\"We have a serious problem,\" said Professor Wu. \"It requires an improvement from everyone, or it will get worse.\nOptions:\nA The importance of losing weight.\nB How people keep fit all over the world.\nC How many countries have health problem.\nD The number of overweight people is growing.\nAnswer:\nD The number of overweight people is growing.\nQuestion:",

The traditional view that the British sit down for an afternoon tea is not popular any more. Few people keep the tradition nowadays.\n* Give tips -- but not in a clear way.   The British would like to choose a quiet way of saying \"thank you\" when they get good service.

If you are not sure what you are talking about, end a sentence with the word \"mate\".\n* Don't talk about money.

But how many of us know the history of the Internet?\nMany people are surprised when they find that the Internet was set up in the 1960s. At that time, computers were large and expensive. Computer networks didn't work well. If one computer in the network broke down, then the whole network stopped. So a new network system  had to be set up. It should be good enough to be used by many different computers. If part of the network was not working, information could be sent through another part. In this way computer network system would keep on working all the time . \nAt first the Internet was only used by the government  , but in the early 1970s; universities, hospitals and banks were allowed to use it, too. However, computers were still very expensive and yet Internet was difficult to use. By the start of the 1990s, computers became cheaper and easier to use. Scientists had also developed   software   that made \"surfing\" the Internet easier.\nToday it is easy to get online and it is said that millions of people use the Internet every day. Sending e-mail is more and more popular among young people.\nThe Internet has become one of the most important parts of people s life.\nQuestion: What can we infer  from the last sentence ?\n- People will die without the Internet.\n- All people should set up their own network.\n- People live easily without the Internet.\n- People will more and more depend on  the Internet.",

You never know which one you will get, so there isn't a cure for each one.\nWhen a virus attacks your body, the body works hard to get rid of it. Blood rushes to your nose and brings congestion with it .You feel terrible because you can't breathe well, but your body is actually \"eating\" the virus. Your temperature rises and you get a fever, but the heat of your body is killing the virus. You also have a running nose to stop the virus from getting to your cells.  You may feel miserable, but actually your wonderful body is doing everything it can to kill the cold.\nDifferent people have different remedies for colds. In the United States and sane other countries, for example, people might eat chicken soup to feel better. Some people take hot baths and drink warm liquids.

Move away from buildings, bridges and trees. If you are driving, stop the car as soon as possible, staying away from bridges and tall buildings, stay in your car.\nAfter an earthquake  ONCE the shaking has stopped, DO NOT run out of the building at once. It is better to wait and leave when it is safe. Check around you and help the people who are in trouble. If your building is badly broken, you should leave it.

In fact, most children are usually ready to eat almost anything that is offered to them. A child often likes food unless it is badly cooked. Never ask a child whether he likes or dislikes a food, never discuss likes and dislikes in front of him or allow anybody else to do so . If the father says that he hates fat meat or the mother refuses some vegetables in the child's hearing, he may copy this action. Parents should agree to the fact that he likes everything and he probably will . At meal times, it is a good idea to give a child a small part at one time rather than give him as much as he may eat all together. Do not talk too much to the child during meal times, but let him get on with his food. And do not allow him to leave the table at once after a meal , or he will soon learn to eat his food hurriedly so he can hurry back to the toys in his room .

Many people have started taking vitamin C pills as a precautionary way. But a research has shown that vitamin C pills do not provide as much protection as they think. They are even not as good as other ways, like often washing your hands. Some German scientists have given people information and a test on the subject helping to stop incorrect ways.\nWhether it is caused by cold or flu , a runny nose and sore throat are signs of catching a cold. Many people overestimate  the advantages of vitamin C and other pills. For years it was believed that taking vitamin C pills not only provided protection against colds but also against cancers, helping people to live longer. But the result of the research showed disagreement on these beliefs . The result has now come out on the website wwww.informedhealthonline.org. \"Some pills may not help people live longer. Some pills may even lead to earlier death,\" says Professor Peter Sawicki. Scientists also say that the best way to get vitamins is through food instead of having vitamin pills. That is to say, we disagree with the way of taking vitamin C pills.\nThere are many simple but useful ways to lower the risk of catching a cold. These include often washing your hands with normal soap  and water and not touching your face with your hands. People who have already had a cold can stop it from spreading by throwing away tissues  at once after using them and not shaking hands with other people.\nQuestion: The best way to get vitamins is   _  .\nOptions: A: eating food which contains Vitamins\nB: taking vitamin pills\nC: drinking water which contains vitamins\nD: eating as much pork as possible",

But this time, they are facing more difficulties, for The Heirs and My Love From the Star really made a full success.\nA senior official said he sometimes watched soap operas from South Korea, as well as House of Cards, an American opera about politics . These operas made both in South Korea and in America have a lot of lovers in China.\nMany people agree that China's soap operas can't be much loved by most Chinese, because they are not as interesting and exciting as those operas from South Korea and America, such as My Love From the Star, a South Korean love story between a time-traveling professor and a famous movie star.\nHowever, South Korea not only provides soap operas but also some variety shows . Where Are We Going, Dad? is not an original Chinese show. We learned it from South Korea although not many in China know about that fact.\nSouth Korea has created many popular shows and these stories tell there's no difference between men and women but in their country men are certain to _\nThe soap operas made in China are not as popular as those in South Korea or America, because   _   .\nA) senior officials don't allow us to watch them\nB) they are not very interesting and exciting\nC) Chinese people are more interested in politics\nD) they were only made twenty years ago",

More and more people have realized we should do something to help them.\nOne of the biggest problems is that the children are all hungry for the love from their parents. Many of them can just get a call or a letter from their parents half a year, a year or even several years, which makes _ When they meet their own troubles, they have no one to talk with. Nobody gives them enough care.\nBecause of being too far away from their parents, the left-behind children's study is the second biggest problem. From a survey   about their study, only two per cent of the children get good results, while ten per cent of them are common and eighty-eight per cent of them are poor. What a pity!\nThere are also many other problems of the left-behind children, such as having no ability to protect themselves, unhealthy lifestyles, spending too much pocket money and being crazy about Internet and so on.\nIn a word, to solve all the problems of the left-behind children needs the government, families and schools to try their best together.\nQuestion: What is the best title of the article?\n- The Left-behind Children\n- What is Left-behind Children\n- The Problems of the Left-behind Children\n- How to help Left-behind Children",

He walked into class one day and told his students that their homework was to perform one act of random  kindness. His students did not understand the homework and didn't know what to do, but the professor would not answer their questions. He encouraged his students to work it out for themselves.\nOne week later, the students entered the classroom excited to share their stories. One student told of giving away blankets to the homeless. Another reported on helping a dog to find its owner, and another student had been trying to find a long, lost friend. Students were energized   by the homework assignment and wanted other people to be kind too. With the support of local businesses, the students made stickers to put on cars that invited people to do something kind for others. They sold the stickers and decided to donate the money to a center for the blind---not surprising as Professor Wall is blind.\nSince then, similar kindness activities have been started in schools around the world. Many schools organize a Random Acts of Kindness Week, around November 13th, to celebrate World Kindness Day. Some schools use each day of Random Acts of Kindness Week to perform a different kind act, such as making a new friend, helping someone, doing community service, or raising money for a charity. Students learn to consider other people and thank about how small actions can make the world a better place.\nQuestion: In kindness activities students learn   _  .\nOptions: A: to deal with difficult things\nB: to do great things every day\nC: to know about the world\nD: to consider other people",

The population of Canada is about 29 million and the capital is Ottawa. The country covers about 9,980,000 square kilometers and six of the world's 24 time areas   as well.\nThere are two official languages spoken in Canada: French and English. Many people can speak both English and French. More than 60% of Canadians speak English as their language. About 25% of the Canadians speak French. In one province of Canada where French is the common language, the programmes on TV and radios as well as the teaching in schools are all in French. Today, Chinese has become the first inofficial  language in Canada.\nCanada's climate is not as cold all year around as some may believe. In winter, temperatures fall below freezing point throughout most of Canada. In summer, the southern provinces often experience high levels of temperatures that can reach over 30degC regularly. The weather in Canada is just like the weather in China. It is rather cold in the north while it is fairly warm in the south. Winters in the north last long with snow for half a year. As the cold northern climate, only one-fifth of the land is suitable for farming.\nAs it is known to all, Canada has one-third of the world's supply of fresh water. It has many great lakes. There are five great lakes in the south. And there are many others, especially in the north. It is also rich in natural resources, such as coal, oil, natural gas of which Canadians make use to produce energy.\nPeople of northern Canada are called Inuit  , who came from Asia and settled in Canada about 4,000 years ago. They used to travel around from place to place with teams of dogs which pulled their baggage. Now, they seldom move. There are about 2,500 Inuit in all. The government has started a new school project in which Inuit teach their own young children. So it is hoped that the way of Inuit life will be kept alive for more centuries.\nOptions:\nA 15%\nB 20%\nC 30%\nD 50%\nAnswer:\nB 20%\nQuestion:",

The test also showed Finland had more top students than the other countries.\nFinns   of your age have done a really good job but don't have a sense of envy. You can learn from them. Most Finnish students make good use of the Internet. Of course not for computer games, but for doing more exercises and finding out more information.\nLibraries are also important. Finland spends a lot of money on them. Many students have a free card. They read for at least one or two hours a day.\nWhat do you usually do on the Internet? How often do you go to libraries?",

It has many things that we need to help us grow. It can give us energy and good health. Milk is a food enjoyed by people of all ages as we can easily _ it.\nMilk is produced by all mother animals to feed their babies after they are born. Some such as cows produce more milk than their young ones need, so the extra milk is used by people. Nowadays, baby cows are often taught to eat solid food earlier, so that we can use most of the cow's milk. A cow can produce as much as 45 liters of milk a day. She will give good milk if she is fed on rich grass. Many products can be made from cow's milk. The simplest is cream, which is made from the fat of the milk. Butter is made from cream. Cream is also used for making cakes and other foods. Another common milk product is cheese. Cow's milk can be also turned into powdered milk.\nIn countries where cows are not raised, people get milk from other animals. The buffalo gives milk to the people of India. In China, Iran and Turkey, a large number of sheep and goats are kept for their milk. And many Arabs drink camel's milk. For babies, however, the best of all is their mother's milk which is given to them during their first few months of life.\nOptions:\nA cows can also produce cheese for people\nB cakes can be made with the powdered milk\nC sheep and camels provide people with milk too\nD milk can make people not only strong but also rich\nAnswer:\nC sheep and camels provide people with milk too\nQuestion:",

The population of Australia is nearly as large as that of Shanghai.\nThe government has made enough laws to fight pollution. The sky is blue and the water is clean. You can clearly see fish swimming in the rivers. Plants grow very well.\nLast month we visited Perth, the biggest city in western Australia, and went to a wild flowers exhibition. There we saw a large number of wild flowers we had never seen before. We had a wonderful time. Perth is famous for its beautiful wild flowers. In spring every year Perth has the wild flowers exhibition. After visiting Perth, we spent the day in the countryside. We sat down and had a rest near a path at the foot of a hill. It was quiet and we enjoyed ourselves. Suddenly we heard bells ringing at the top of the hill. What we saw made us pick up all our things and run back to the car as quickly as we could. There were about three hundred sheep coming towards us down the path.\nAustralia is famous for its sheep and kangaroos. After a short drive from the town, you will find yourself in the middle of white sheep. Sheep, sheep everywhere.\nQuestion: What do you know about Australia according to the passage?\nAnswer:",

But neither of them likes to use his head. They work hard but they are both poor. Most villagers have built new houses, but they still live in the low and broken houses. They never find out why.\nOnce Uncle Li went to town to buy some medicine for his wife. In the town he heard the apples in a city were expensive. He told Uncle Wang about it as soon as he went back. They decided to carry some apples to the city. They borrowed some money from their friends and bought nearly 1,000 kilograms of apples in the villages and carried them to the city on a tractor . Bad luck! A lot of apples were in the city when they arrived. A few days later they had to sell them at a low price. They felt unhappy and returned to their village.\n\"I can't understand why we sustained   losses  in business while others always profit  \" Uncle Li asked one day.\n\"The tractor was too small\" Uncle Wang said without thinking. \"We'll carry more apples on a truck next time!\"\n\"I agree!\" said Uncle Li. \"How foolish we were!\"\nWhich of the following is true?\nA) The two farmers found out why they were poor.\nB) The two farmers will soon get rich.\nC) Neither of the farmers is clever.\nD) The two farmers decided to buy a truck.",

Perhaps we will go back to using horses, carriages and bicycles.\nIn the Second World War, some people didn't use gas made from petroleum  in their cars. They made gas from wood and plants instead. The car didn't go fast, but they ran, so this was better than nothing. However, in the future, we can't cut down all our trees to make gas; we need our trees for other things, too.\nBesides different types of gas, we can also use electricity  to run our cars, but first we must make the electricity! Some countries have coal  and they make electricity with that, but we might not always have coal, either. Other countries have big, strong rivers, and they can use the power of water to turn turbines  and make electricity more easily and cheaply.\nWe are also able to get power from the ocean tides.

If you do, you must be an optimist , a leader, an active person who enjoys life, people and excitement. Do you prefer greys and blues? Then you are probably quiet, shy and you would rather follow than lead. If you love green, you are strong-minded and determined. You wish to succeed and want other people to see you are successful. At least this is what psychologists tell us, and they should know, because they have been seriously studying the meaning of colour preference, and the influence that colours have on human beings. They tell us that we don't choose our favourite colours as we grow up. If you happen to love brown, you did so as soon as you opened your eyes, or at least as soon as you could see clearly.\nA yellow room makes us feel more cheerful and more comfortable than a dark green one, and a red dress brings warmth and cheer to the saddest winter day. On the other hand, black is depressing. Light and bright colours make people not only happier but more active. It is a fact that factory workers work better, harder, and have fewer accidents when their machines and painted orange rather than black or dark grey.\nRemember, then, that if you feel low, you can always brighten your day or your life with a new shirt or a few colourful things. Remember also that you will know your friends and your enemies better when you find out what colours they like and dislike. And don't forget that anyone can guess a lot about your character when you choose a piece of handkerchief .\nQuestion: The author believes in the passage that   _   .\n- anyone can choose his color preference in his life\n- no one can choose his color preference in his life\n- anyone is born with his color preference\n- no one is born with his color preference",

Science fiction writers have written about flying cars for a long time. But now flying cars will soon fly out of the world of science fiction into our real world. And the dream of the science fiction writers will soon come true.\nThe first-known sky car is the FSC-1. The FSC-1 looks like an expensive sports car. You can drive the FSC-1 on the road like a normal car. If you touch a button, its wings and propeller   fold out and then it can take off, fly and land as an airplane. The owners of the FSC-1 can choose if they want to drive or fly.\nAnother flying car or sky car is the Moller Skycar M400. Although you can't drive it on the roads, it is small and easy to fly and can take off and land like a helicopter  . Urban Aeronautics' X-Hawk is another type of sky car.

With time on, the little boy grew up. He no longer played around it every day. One day, the boy came back, sad. \"Come and play with me,\" the tree said. \"I am no longer a kid.\" The boy replied, \" I need money to buy toys.\" \"I don't have money..., but you can pick all my apples and sell them.\" The boy was so excited. He picked all apples and left happily. The boy never came back after that.\nOne day, the boy returned. \"Come and play with me,\" the tree said happily. \"I have no time to play. We need a house for my family.\" \"You can cut off my branches.\" So the boy cut all the branches off the tree and left happily.

They are mammals  .They live in groups and speak to each other in their own language. But they are quite different from almost all land animals. Their brain is as big as men's and they live a long life at least 20 or 30 years.\nLike some animals, dolphins use sounds to help them find their way around. They also use these sounds to talk to each other and to help them find food. They do not use their ears to receive sounds,but use the jaw--the lower part of the mouth.\nIt is strange that dolphins are friendly to men, and for thousands of years, there are many stories about dolphins and men. In the 19th century, in a dangerous part of the sea near New Zealand,there was a dolphin. The seamen liked him very much and gave him a very good name, Jack. From 1871 to 1903 ,Jack met every boat in the area and showed it the way. In 1903 a passenger on a boat with the name of The Penguin shot and hurt Jack. Luckily the dolphin didn't die, and after a long time he was well again. He guided the ships through the area for nine more years, but he refused to help the boat of the Penguin.\nToday, some people still kill dolphins, but many countries in the world now protect them. In these places, people are not allowed to kill them.\nOptions:\nA 32 years\nB 9 years\nC 41 years\nD 23 years\nAnswer:\nC 41 years\nQuestion:",

They think I should eat healthier food, should wear cleaner clothes, and I should get better grades. And according to them, my hair should be shorter, my room should be neater, and my friends should be more polite when they come to visit. You know it isn't easy to be a teenager.\nWe try to be good parents, but no matter how hard we try, our children never seem to be satisfied. They think we should wear more fashionable clothes, we should buy a faster car, and we should listen to more beautiful music. And according to them, we should be more patient when they talk about their problems, we should be more friendly when their friends come to visit, and we should be more understanding when they come home late on Saturday night. You know it isn't easy to be parents, either. Do you and your parents also have such problems?\nWell, why don't you take a walk and have a talk on Saturday? May 15th is the International Day of Families.  On that day, people around the world give thanks for good things about their families and work on family problems.\nA study last year showed that many Nanjing families had the same problem like this. The children, 12 to 15 years old, didn't like talking with their parents much. They weren't happy at home. Of course, lots of kids have the same feeling like that. But you and your parents will be much happier if you can be friends. Parents are the closest people to you in the world. They love you just because you're their child.

        "Article: Some scientists say that animals in the ocean are increasingly threatened  by noise pollution caused by human beings. The noise that affects sea animals comes from a number of human activities. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves.\nDecibels  measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of one hundred and twenty decibels on land caused pain to human ears. In water, a decibel level of one hundred and ninety-five would have the same effect.\nSome scientists have planned to set a noise limit of one hundred and twenty decibels in oceans. They have found that noises at that level can frighten and confuse  whales.\nA team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises can seriously hurt some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing. This seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected.\nMany researchers whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree to a limit of one hundred and twenty decibels. They say such a limit would mean an end to important industrial and scientific research. Scientists do not know how much and what kinds of noises are harmful to ocean animals. However, many scientists suspect  that noise is a greater danger than they believed.

It's a popular 3D movie, and you may have to wear a special pair of glasses - 3D glasses, to see it. The 3D glasses make the images from the movie look as if they are coming straight at you.\n3D movies are really exciting to watch. More and more 3D movies are coming to theaters. Some say that 3D TV sets will come into our homes in the near future. 3D technology can make TV and movies more exciting. However, people with eye problems may get headaches if they spend too much time watching 3D movies. Why?\nWhen we look at an object, each eye sees it at a different angle  . Our eyes send the two images to our brain, and the brain puts them together. 3D technology uses two film projectors  .  One projects left-eye-image and the other projects a right-eye-image. 3D glasses allow us to see a different image in each eye. So, when we are watching a 3D movie, our brain can't put together the images sent to our eyes. The brain needs to work harder at \"reading\" the images. That makes it easier for people with eye problems to get dizzy   or have headaches.\nDr John Hagan, an eye doctor in Kansas City, said if your eyes can't focus on the same object at once, you will have trouble watching 3D movies.\nQuestion: What is Avatar?\nOptions: A: It's a kind of 3D projector.\nB: It's a kind of 3D TV set.\nC: It's a movie.\nD: It's an animal.",

But in the past people went to diners. Do you want to know the story of the first American diner?\nIn 1872, a man named Walter Scott had the first \"diner\". It was not really a diner. It was only a simple food cart . People on the street walked up to the cart to buy food. The cart served late-night workers who wanted a cup of coffee and a late night meal. The meal was a sandwich or boiled eggs. In 1887, Samuel Messer Jones built the first big enough diner to allow customers to come inside. However, they had no chairs to sit down. Three years later, people built diners with counters and stools and people sat down while they were eating.\nBefore long, many diners stayed open around the clock. In other words, people were able to eat in a diner at any time. Diners changed in other ways, too. The earliest menu which only included sandwiches and coffee became bigger. Soup and dishes were added to the menu, and a breakfast menu appeared, too. In addition, diners were no longer carts on wheels.\nDiners today are usually buildings with large windows, shining counters and stools, tables and chairs, where people can eat all three meals.\nQuestion: When could customers sit down and eat inside diners?\nOptions: A: In 1872.\nB: In 1877.\nC: In 1887.\nD: In 1890.",

At the moment we're staying near Uluru--that's the aboriginal  name for Ayers Rock. On the first day, we took a balloon tour over the rock, and I was surprised at how big it was: 3.6 kilometers long and 384 meters high. The colors of the rock are fantastic, and at different times of the day, they change from purple to red. The Aborigines are the first people of Australia, and the ancient aboriginal stories describe the spirits that created the world. Uluru is a center of Aboriginal culture.\nThe Australians have many British relatives. That's why they're like us in many ways. Their family life is similar to ours, and they enjoy the same food and hobbies. The food and drink that most Australians like are grapes, lamb, ham and especially wine that they make in the south of the country. They love all sports, but football is the most popular. Most Australians live near the coast, so they also love going to the beach, swimming and surfing.\nAlthough it's December, it's summer over here. The sunshine is very bright, and near the coast the countryside is very green. There are lots of sheep in the fields and on the hills, but the outback  is more like a desert, full of rocks and sand.\nThe next day after we arrived at Uluru, we went on a camel  ride. The camel that I rode had a bad _ . When I sat on its back, it became very angry and refused me. So everyone else thought it was very funny that my camel kept lying down...\nFinally, later this evening, we're taking the plane back to Sydney and coming home, it's been a fantastic trip!\nTony\nQuestion: What is the best title of this passage?\nOptions: A: A Balloon Tour\nB: An Aboriginal Letter\nC: A Fantastic Trip\nD: A Summer Evening",

        "American nutrition expert Professor Barry Popkin says that the number of overweight people in the world is now bigger than the number of people who don't have enough to eat. A billion people worldwide now weigh too much and the number of obese people is now more than 300 million. \"Obese\" means at least 15 kilos heavier than you should be. However, there are also 800 million people in the world who don't have enough to eat.\nProfessor Popkin says that the number of hungry people is falling slowly but the number of overweight people is rising fast. The main reasons for this are:\n* People are doing less hard physical work\n* More people worldwide now eat too much fatty food\n* Too many people are driving cars instead of walking\n* People spend too much time in front of a television\nThe United States has the highest rate of obesity in the developed world and Japan has the lowest. Professor Benjamin Senauer is absolutely certain of the reasons for this.\n\"Japanese people are fit. They use public transport and walk,\" he said. \"The average American drives to work and drives to supermarket. When he gets home, he sits on a couch in front of the TV and eats junk food.\"\nIn Britain and many other European countries, there are three times as many obese people as there were 20 years ago. About two thirds of British adults are overweight or obese. \"The effects of this are clear,\" said London doctor Elena Power. \"We have more illnesses related to weight and fewer fit people.\nChina used to be one of the slimmest nations in the world. However, Professor Wu Yangfeng from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in Beijing recently estimated  that 20 percent of the world's overweight people live in China. The Chinese government is especially worried about the increase in obesity among schoolchildren.\n\"We have a serious problem,\" said Professor Wu. \"It requires an improvement from everyone, or it will get worse.\nWhich of the following is Not True according to the passage ?\nA) Being overweight can cause more illnesses.\nB) About two thirds of British people are overweight.\nC) More and more schoolchildren are overweight in China.\nD) Most Japanese people are healthier than those in other countries.",

Here's some information about the sports.\nSports 1: Basketball\nWe expect that this will be the most popular of the four sports. So students should sign up   as soon as possible. Students will take a private bus to and from Kwun Tong Sports Park. Each student will have to pay $ 10 each time for the cost of the bus. There will be four basketball courts available for our use with one teacher watching over each game.\nSports 2: Gym\nWe will use St. Peter's Park. There are two reasons for choosing this park. First, it is not very busy and crowded before 6:00 p.m. Second, it has lots of trees with plenty of shade. Students must bring along two bottles of water to prevent from being thirsty. All the activities here are free. And there will be a teacher on duty for each activity.\nSports 3: Hiking\nHiking  will be at Kowloon Peak. The activity will start at 2:30 p.m. and finish 90 minutes later. There will be 15 students in each group. And three teachers will be with the students. This sport will cost $ 75 per hour. Students should take plenty of water and sunglasses.\nSports 4: Swimming\nThe Kowloon City Swimming Centre is a 10-minute walk from our school. Four teachers will go to the pool and watch the students from the poolside. We will only be able to use the pool for one hour (2: 45 p.m. to 3:45 p.m.). Only students skillful at swimming can take up this activity. The pool will have two lifeguards on watch. Girls must wear swimming suits. The cost is $ 15 per visit.\nOptions:\nA There is a lot of shade there\nB all the activities there are cheap\nC the park is very busy before 6: 00 p. m.\nD there aren't many people after 6:00 p. m. there.\nAnswer:\nA There is a lot of shade there\nQuestion:",

Tim Harries gives out free hugs to every customer at the end of each meal. The atmosphere at his restaurant \"Tim's Place\" is so positive that customers often call it the \"World's friendliest restaurant\".\n\"Tim's Hug\" is in fact an item on the menu described as a \"love\" treat. Tim's hugs are doubly special because of everything he has achieved. The 26-year-old is probably the only Down syndrome sufferer in the U.S. to own a restaurant,but he has several other things to be proud of-- he's a skillful special Olympian, an excellent sailor, and all experienced fisherman. He was also chosen as Homecoming King and Student of the Year in high school! So when a man like Tim hugs you,it is sure to be a special and unforgettable experience\nWhen Tim expressed interest in opening a restaurant,Keith,a small businessman himself, supported him. Tim hired other people to manage the place and do the cooking, and he introduced the idea of free hugs. He realized that people want to feel at home at a restaurant. That is why he included \"love\" as all item on the menu. Customers can order the free hug from Tim,and even if they don't, he'll probably hug them anyway.\nThe restaurant has been around since 2010,and Tim has given out over 19,000 hugs in the past five years -- he keeps count using a special Hug Counter.Many customers love visiting \"Tim's Place\". \"I've been coming here once a week.\" said Michelle Garth-Jones, a regular customer. \"I love local restaurants, and this special one has a story that stays with you.\"\nQuestion: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?\nOptions: A: Customers prefer to feel relaxed at a restaurant.\nB: Unless you order Tim's Hug, he will not hug you.\nC: As soon as you enter Tim's Place, you will get a warm hug.\nD: Michelle Garth-Jones loves listening to the story in the restaurant.",

However, with the fast development of mobile phones, it has lost its place in people's everyday life. In order to save their loved red phone boxes, people have come up with many ideas, for example, to turn them into toilets or art houses.\nIn a village in Somerset, a place in South West England, villagers have found a new way to save their red phone box. They turned it into a mini library to deal with the shortage of libraries in their area. The idea was given by a local villager, Janet Fisher, who lives opposite the phone box. Villagers got together to set up the book box. Over 100 books and a lot of movies and music CDs are available at this mini library. The books are of different kinds, including from cooking books to the classics and children's books. People can put the books that they have read inside the phone box, and take away the books that they'd like to read. The books are always changing. There is a regular check on the books to keep the phone box collection fresh.\nAnyone is free to come to read books there. The phone box library is open every day around the clock and is lit (the past form of \"light\") at night.  \" It's very pleasing that the red phone box has been saved.

In this article, you'll learn how acid is created, and how it affects us, and more importantly, what we all can do to prevent it.\nHow is acid rain created?\nWhen people use fuels , such as coal and gasoline, poisonous gases are given off. When these gases mix with rain, acid rain forms. Many power stations burn fuels in order to create the electricity  that we use in our homes and offices every day. Cars and trucks also send these gases into the air when they burn gasoline .When rain mixes with these gases, harmful things called acids form. This is acid rain.\nHow does acid rain affect us?\nAcid rain damages everything that it touches. It poisons our rivers, ponds, lakes, and oceans along with all the life in them. It pollutes our soil and crops, harms trees, and can even kill fish and plants. Acid rain also eats away at buildings.\nHow can we prevent acid rain?\nWe need to cut down on the pollution that gets into our air. Turn off lights, television, and other electrical appliances if you are not using them, Walk or take a bike whenever possible.

Alice is 15 and she is a guide who shows visitors around the Fort Delaware Museum in New York. \"This year, I spun wool on a spinning wheel. Last year, I was a candle maker. My first year, I cared for the garden and looked after the animals. All the jobs I've had at the fort have been really fun.\"\nFort Delaware is a living-history museum that shows how life was in frontier America in the mid-1700s. \"Reading about history can't compare to experiencing it for yourself,\" says Alice.\nThe experience begins as soon as visitors enter the fort. The smell of wood smoke fills the air. Women in petticoats (long skirts) and men in knee breeches(knee-length shorts) are busy with their chores. The guides show visitors how the settles would have carried out everyday work. \"Kids are surprised when I tell them that one of their jobs would have been to make candles,\" says another guide, 16-year-old Jane. \"They don't realize that kids back then had to work hard.\" She also shows visitors how to play with toys and games.\nThey are playing historical parts, so the guides can't wear shorts or T-shirts when the weather is hot. But the clothes of the past can easily change modern kids into people from 18th century. \"The clothing felt strange at first, but it does make it easier to get into characters,\" says Jane.\nWorking at the fort has helped Jane to appreciate her life even more.

Last month,I had a chance at last to go on such a holiday with some of my schoolmates and we went to London,a place where I had wanted to go since years ago.\nAs we were still young,we had a group leader who planned things for us and looked after us. After we got to London,we went to stay with different families. I was lucky that my host family   was a white couple who had a daughter about my age. They treated me as a daughter of their family during my stay there. They were interested in me and I learnt a lot of things from them,too.\nThe holiday was filled with activities every day. After breakfast,a local teacher would come to take us in his car. Then we would have classes or go on a sightseeing trip to different places of interest like the Big Ben,the London Bridge,and the Buckingham Palace. We would go back to our own homes after the activities.\nThe holiday was a valuable experience for me. I enjoyed every minute of it. Yet,time really flew fast.

You finish drinking the tea. Now, what do you do with the box? Do you drop it on the ground? Or, do you do the right thing and drop it in a trash can? Hopefully, you drop it in the trash can because, besides harming the environment, littering is also very impolite.\nRecently, a magazine published a list of the most polite cities in the world. They looked three things: did people litter, did shop clerks say thank you and did people hold the door open for the person behind them? The top three politest cities were New York, USA, Zurich, Switzerland, and Toronto, Canada. Hong Kong, China was number 35. Shanghai wasn't even on the list.\nDoes that mean that Shanghai is not a polite city? Well, maybe. There are different ways to judge  politeness but the survey was looking at how a visitor to a city would feel when walking around its public places. Visitors don't like to step over empty tea boxes as they walk down the street. They don't like it when they buy something and the shop clerk doesn't say thank you or even give them a smile. They also don't like it when someone lets a door slam  into them instead of holding it open.\nShanghai is a nice city but it is not always the most polite city. I don't think this is intentional . I think it's just a lack of awareness . China is becoming a popular place for tourists to visit. When they come to Shanghai they will find a friendly city: it would be nice if they also found a polite one. And, remember, being polite makes you feel good, too. It's nice to be nice.\nQuestion: The writer mainly wants to tell us   _  .\nOptions: A: not to drink tea in the street\nB: to hold the door open for anybody\nC: to remember to be polite in public places\nD: to travel to the most polite cities more often",

He has made wigs for the stars of more than seventy movies, including Tom Hanks inPhiladelphia, Johnny Depp in Sleepy Hollow, and Nicole Kidman in The Others. One of his biggest jobs so far has been designing the hair and make-up  for the three Lord of the Rings movies. He had just six weeks to design and make more than a hundred wigs, each one a different style, colour, shape and length.\nThe hair and make-up in a movie are just as important as the costumes  or the sets. Over the years, Peter has made actors look older, younger, healthy and sick. For one movie he even made a female actor look like a man!\"What people don't realize about wigs is that we are not always making people more beautiful,\" he says. \"Often we are covering up beauty and making them look ordinary.\"\nAll Peter's wigs are hand-made using human hair, so they look as real as possible. This also makes them very expensive--between US$4,500 and US$12,500 each! He knows he's done a good job when people don't realize the star of the movie is wearing a wig.

At least this is what psychologists tell us, and they should know, because they have been seriously studying the meaning of colour preference  , and the effect that colours have on human beings .They tell us that we don't choose our favorite colour as we grow up. If you happen to love brown, you did so as soon as you opened your eyes, or at least as soon as you could see clearly.\nA yellow room makes us feel more cheerful and comfortable than a dark green one, and a red dress brings warmth and cheer to the saddest winter day. On the other hand, black is depressing . Light and bright colours make people not only happier but also more active. It is a fact that factory workers work better, harder, and have fewer accidents when their machines are painted orange rather than black or dark grey .\nRemember, then, that if you feel low, you can always brighten your day or your life with a new shirt or a few colourful things. Remember also that you will know your friends and your enemies better when you find out what colours they like and dislike. And don't forget that anyone can guess a lot about your character when you choose a piece of handkerchief or a lampshade .",

Recycling language means using vocabulary that you have learnt before again and again. However, unlike rubbish that piles up in our environment, if we do not recycle language, we simply forget it. So how do you recycle language?\nThere are basically three ways to do it. The first is through reading. Go back to your favourite articles and read them once more. Just reread them and do not worry about each vocabulary item. If there are some that you are not sure about, make a guess and you will probably guess right. The second way to recycle is through writing. Look at some of your favourite articles and write either a short paragraph or a few sentences in your own words. After you have done this a few times, go back and read through what you have written, checking vocabulary functions. Don't worry if you have made mistakes. That's how you learn. The third way to recycle language is by having an imaginary chat with yourself about your favourite articles at home. You can pretend there is someone with you who speaks English and tell him what you are thinking about or how you feel.\nQuestion: If we recycle language, it may   _  .\n- be kept in our mind\n- be forgotten easily\n- pile up in our environment\n- disappear from our mind soon",

Each family in Scotland has its own colors.\nHow did the Scots start to wear kilts? There are many stories about it. One story is that the kilt was invented   in the 1720s by an English factory owner, Thomas Rawlinson. Rawlinson had a lot of Scottish workers in his factory and he thought their clothing _ their work. So he cut their long clothes into a shorter skirt.\nToday, most Scotsmen see kilts as formal dresses. They usually only wear them at weddings or big dinners. There are only a few men who still wear a kilt every day. Scots also wear kilts in parades when they play their traditional musical instrument : bagpipes  . The army still has kilts as the dress uniform  , but they no longer wear them to fight  .\nQuestion: The story mainly tells us   _  .\n- things about Scotsmen's traditional kilts\n- how to wear kilts\n- when to wear kilts\n- Scotsmen's important tradition",

        "When I was growing up, I had an old neighbor, Dr. Gibbs. He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He never invited us to play in his yard, but he was a very kind person.\nWhen Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was planting trees. He owned a large field and wanted to make it a forest.\nThe good doctor had some interesting ideas about planting trees. He never watered his new trees. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants spoiled them, and that if you watered them, each baby tree would grow weaker and weaker, so you had to make things difficult for them and pick out the weaker trees early on.\nHe talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in search of water under the earth by themselves. Deep roots were very important.\nSo he never watered his trees. He'd planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he'd beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention.\nDr. Gibbs died several years after I left home. Every now and then, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I watched him plant about twenty-five years ago. They're very big and strong now. I planted some trees a few years back and carried water to them for whole summer.\nAfter two years of caring too much, whenever a cold wind blows in, they shake a lot.\nEvery night before I go to bed, I check on my two sons. Mostly I pray that their lives will be easy. But lately I've been thinking that it's time to change my prayer. I know my children are going to face difficulties. There's always cold wind blowing somewhere, so what we need to do is to pray for roots that reach deep into the brave heart, so when the rains fall and the winds blow, we could face it strongly and won't be beaten down.\nWhich can be the best title of the passage?\nA) Watering trees\nB) Growing roots\nC) Doctor and his neighbor\nD) Father and his children",

He can meet a lot of people every day. He always works late into the night because there are lots of people calling his taxi during the night. He usually goes home after two o'clock in the morning. There are some very strange things, which often happen at night.\nOne day Jack was taking a young lady back home from a party at three o'clock in the morning. She had her little dog with her. When they got to her house, she found that she had lost her key. So Jack waited in the taxi with the dog while she climbed into her house through the window. Jack waited for about half an hour outside, but the young lady didn't show up . So he decided to find out what was going on. He tied the dog to a tree and started to climb in through the window.\nAt that moment some policeman came. They thought Jack was a thief  who wanted to get into the house to steal  things. Luckily, the young lady came downstairs.

This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cellphones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the \"translation\" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great.\nSchool teachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming  the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted .\nEveryone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says. \"Kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.\"\nLinguist James Milroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can _ that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become \"corrupted\"; they simply change to meet the new needs.\nHowever, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia McVey says, \"I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their...\nOptions:\nA Cynthia McVry points out teenagers can deal with Netspeak properly.\nB Geoffrey Nunberg believes Netspeakers can write Standard English.\nC David Crystal thinks Netspeak helps develop the habit of writing.\nD James Milroy says that language is changing and improving.\nAnswer:\nC David Crystal thinks Netspeak helps develop the habit of writing.\nQuestion:",

        "This sad story happened on a cold winter evening. It was so cold and snow was falling so heavily that the roads were covered with ice and a strong wind was blowing. Being outside in such weather was very unwise. However, Peter Lee had to walk home from work. Peter walked with difficulty along a country road, the cold wind beating against his chest. He thought, \"If I wear my coat backwards, maybe, it will be a little bit warmer for me.\" He stopped walking, took off his coat, and put it on backwards. \"That's much better,\" he said to himself happily. Walking on through the thickly falling snow, he was thinking about drinking a cup of warm coffee by the burning fireplace.\nA few minutes later, a car knocked down Peter. The driver hadn't seen him soon enough. When he tried his best to put on the brakes  , the car skidded   on the icy road. The frightened driver got out of the car and ran to see how the poor man was.\nAfter a while, a police car arrived. A policeman went up to see Mr Lee who was lying on the ground. He told the driver, \"I'm afraid he's dead.\"\nThe driver was so surprised. \"This can't be the case, because I hardly touched him. Check my car carefully. There's not a mark on it.\"\nThe policeman said, \"I'm sure he's dead.\"\n\"It's impossible,\" the driver said anxiously. \"As soon as I hit him, I ran to help him. He was lying on the road, but he was breathing and there was no blood.\"\n\"Did you touch him?\" the policeman asked.\n\"Yes, but only to turn his head around the right way,\" the driver answered.\nAccording to the writer, Peter Lee   _   .\nA) was wise\nB) didn't need to walk home in such bad weather\nC) was in bad need of going home\nD) had difficulty in finding the road leading to his home",

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer:\nArticle: Some children cannot wait to grow up. Because once you become an adult, you are free to make your own decisions. More importantly, you can do all those things that you cannot do now because you are too young. So, the question is, 'At what age do you really become an adult?' Well, people become adults at different ages in different places.\nIn Australia, the 18th birthday is a very important event for young Australians because it means they can do almost anything they want. They can vote, learn to drive a car, get married, join the army and even buy their own houses. However, even if they can do all these things, most Australians have to wait until their 21st birthday to really celebrate becoming an adult. This is the traditional adult age not only in Australia, but also in the USA and the UK. It is their first year of true independence  .Traditionally, people were given a key to their houses by their parents when they turned 21, meaning they could come and go as they like.\nEven though 21 is the traditional adult age in many English-speaking countries, the law nowadays is different in each country. In the UK, you can join the army at 16 and even get married at 16 if your parents allow. Young people in the UK can learn to drive a car at 17 as in Australia, although they have to wait until they are 18 to vote.\nIn China, there is a different age for each of the stages of becoming an adult. You can vote and learn to drive a car when you are 18, but if you want to get married, women have to wait until they are 20 and men until they are 22. Chinese people celebrate important birthdays every 10 years--so when young people turn 20, they can expect a big party!\nNo matter what age you are, becoming an adult is really about learning how to be independent and responsible . Once you are finally able to take care of yourself and make your own decisions, then you can say that you are truly all grown-ups.\nOptions:\nA Because the law decides it.\nB Because they can leave when they want.\nC Because they can come home when they want.\nD Because it is a tradition.\nAnswer:\nD Because it is a tradition.\nQuestion:",

        "Article: The Oxford English Dictionary (OED, ) is thinking of adding the Chinese word tuhao   to its 2014 edition  .\nThe word has become popular in China during the past few months to describe newly rich people who spend money in extravagant(,)ways. Tuhao has\nin Western countries, too, to describe similar people in their countries.\nThe adoption   of the word by foreign countries is an example of China's spreading influence in the world not just economically, but also socially and culturally. People are paying attention to what is happening in China and are picking up some Chinese words in the process, especially those words that express unique   Chinese ideas that cannot be easily translated   into English.\nThe OED is also thinking of adding hukou   and dama   to the already 120 Chinese words in its dictionary. Hukou refers to   China's system of residency permits   and dama refers to middle-aged Chinese women whose gold buying habits influence the global gold markets. The news that the OED was adding these words has met with some criticism  . Some people say the words embarrass   China, but others insist that in a globalized   society it's natural for words to spread and be adopted elsewhere. In fact, a word like tuhao expresses the humor of China. It's easy to pronounce   and very accurate   at poking fun at   rich people who have more money than taste.\nQuestion: _    may be adopted in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2014 according to the passage.\nYes or no, is the answer \"All above\"?",

You'll probably get hungry when you normally eat and tired when you normally sleep.

        "Article: I have spent almost a third of my life in China, living and working in this beautiful country. In a sense, China has been and is still my second home But in those past years I had never been to Quzhou.\nSome days ago, for the first time in my Chinese life, I stepped into the beautiful city of Quzhou. My impressions of Quzhou city were as I always thought: green countryside, rainy sky, wet air. That was what I imagined for years the south of China would be. When we finally arrived, I was impressed by the elegant   city.\nNext day we were taken to visit some places not far away from the city. I was not aware of the direction of our short trip, but when we arrived at Lanke Mountain and got out of the car, I thought that we had been taken to a fairyland   : the light rain over the green and thick plants, the silvery sky like a heavy blanket and the mystery   of this mountain made me feel like being part of a picture.\nJiulong Lake was our next step. The mystic atmosphere   of this place was so strong that I decided to watch the view standing at the top when I stepped into the small boat to sail upstream. Sometimes we were so close to the mountain that we could clearly see the red soil under the plants. _ \nThe final leg of the day's journey was a primary school. We were welcomed by the smiles on the faces of many young pioneers. The energy of the hundreds of kids made me feel younger for a while, so educated, so polite and so warm that I had no doubt about the future generations of Quzhou people. The people seem to me the best of Quzhou and they will remain in my memories forever.\nQuestion: The writer visited   _   places the next day in Quzhou.\nYes or no, is the answer \"three\"?",

As you know, the prizes were started by a Swede called Alfred Nobel. He was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Alfred Nobel was a great scientist. He made two important inventions, and so he became very rich. Although he was rich, Nobel was not a happy man. He never married or had children. Also, he was a sick man during his large part of life. When he died at the age of 63, he left a fund of $9,000,000. The money was to be used in giving prizes to those who made great achievements in physics, chemistry , medicine and literature , and for world peace.\nThe first Nobel Prizes were given on December 10, 1901, five years after Nobel's death. Since then many famous people from all over the world have been given Nobel Prizes for their achievements.\nEach prize has three parts. The first part is a gold medal. Second, a winner of a Nobel Prize is given a certificate saying that he has been given the prize. The third part of the prize is a large amount of money-about $40,000.\nOften a prize is given to just one person, but not always. Sometimes a prize is shared. It may be given to two or more people who have worked together. It is also sometimes true that a prize is not given at all if there is no great achievement. In 1972, for example, no Nobel Peace Prize was given.\nQuestion: What kind of person would you say Alfred Nobel was?\nAnswer:",

That's probably why I am writing this, because it seems an easier way of telling you how thankful I am to you.\nWhen I first got ill two years ago and had to be taken to hospital, you were the first person I called to tell, maybe because I knew Mum wasn't going to answer her phone, but probably because you are the first person I call in an emergency.\nAs one illness turned into another and I was stuck in hospital for weeks, feeling sorry for myself, you were still at my beside trying to talk to me to cheer me up. The illness hit my kidney  and we then realized that I was going to need a transport sooner or later. You put yourself forward to be tested as soon as possible and it turned out you were a perfect match.\nThen last year, in March, we both went down for the operation. I woke a few hours afterwards and felt better. It wasn't until the following day that we got to see each other again. We hugged silently and asked one another how we were. But I never said the words I should have--- thank you. To this day, I still haven't said those words to you for my kidney.\nIn the month after the operation, when we were both at home recovering, I made you lunch, went for walks with you. It's my way of saying that I care for you a great deal and that I am truly thankful for what you did for me.\nI want you to know that my silence towards you and the times you tried to talk to me and got nothing weren't because of you. Maybe one day when you will read this, I hope you know that in my own silent way, I am for ever thankful.\nQuestion: The writer developed the passage in the form of  _  .\nOptions: A: a letter\nB: a report\nC: a review\nD: a novel",

        "Article: How can a small stamp be worth $16,800?\nAny mistake made in the printing of a stamp raises its value to stamp collectors. A mistake on a two-penny stamp has made it worth a million and a half times its face value.\nDo you think it impossible? Well, it is true. And this is how it happened.\nThe mistake was made more than a hundred years ago in the former British colony   of M auritius  , a small island in the Indian Ocean. In 1847 an order for stamps was sent to London. Mauritius was about to become the fourth country in the world to put out stamps.\nBefore the order was filled and the stamps arrived from England, a big dance was planned by the commander-in-chief   of all the armed forces on the island. The dance would be held in his house and letters of invitation would be sent to all the important people in Mauritius. Stamps were badly needed to post the letters. Therefore, an islander, who was a good printer, was told to copy the pattern of the stamps. He carelessly put the words \"Post Office\" instead of \"Post Paid\", two words seen on stamps at that time, on the several hundred that he printed.\nToday, there are only twenty-six of these misprinted stamps left--- fourteen One-penny Reds and twelve Two-penny Blues. Because there are so few Two-Penny Blues and because of their age, collectors have paid as much as $16,800 for one of them.\nQuestion: When a mistake is made in the printing of the stamp, the stamp  _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"increases in value\"?",

Most of the letters he received were interesting and quite easy to answer. Then came a letter from a person named Joe.\n\"Dear Amy,\" it began, \"I'm in real trouble. I've wanted to be a songwriter all my life, but my parents won't even let me take music lessons. I have a guitar, but they both get angry if I play. I've tried explaining, but they won't listen. I feel sad. Should I run away from home? Maybe that will make my parents agree.\" The letter signed \"Joe\".\nAndy thought about this letter for a long time. Should he advise someone to run away from home?\nOf course not. But didn't Joe have a right to be a songwriter if he wanted to? Andy thought hard, but couldn't think out a good answer. Andy couldn't sleep. He just worried about poor Joe.\nAt a bar a few days later, Eleanor, a girl in Andy's Maths class, sat down next to him and asked,\n\"What's wrong with you?

I'm afraid you'll never learn to swim just by reading books about swimming or looking at others swimming. It's the same with the English study. We must practice, practice and practice.\nListening and speaking are very important for beginners. The children in English-speaking countries first listen to others. Then they try to imitate and speak. We can listen to English programs on radio. You may just understand a few words. It doesn't matter. Just be relaxed, try to catch every word.\nSomebody may be a good listener. But he dare not speak. He's afraid of making mistakes. You know we sometimes make mistakes when we speak Chinese. Don't be afraid. We must be brave. If you really want to learn English well, you must try to speak with everyone so long as he knows English. Whether you know him or not is not important when there's nobody to talk with, you can talk to yourself in English. It's interesting and also a good way to practice your spoken English. Remember, the more you speak, the fewer mistakes you'll make.\nReading and writing are more important for senior school students. First we must choose the books we're interested in. A lot of reading will improve your language sense. This is the most important.\nKeep writing English diaries. We can also write English articles. You may even post them to English magazines. Don't be afraid of failure. Failure is the mother of success.\nEasier said than done. Well, let's do more practice from now on. I'm sure you'll learn English well in this way.\nQuestion: We should learn English by   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"A and B\"?",

        "Article: There's no pizza on Mars, but scientists have found a solution to this problem for hungry astronauts: a pizza printer! NASA, the American space agency, has developed a machine that \"prints\" food. They showed a model of the printer in Austin, Texas last month.\nHow does it work? Cartridges  filled with powdered dough , cheese, sauce, water and oil put the ingredients layer by layer onto a printer bed. The printer bed, which gets hot from below, cooks the food as it's being printed.\nSince most of the ingredients are powdered, they can be sent into space and stored for many years without going bad. Water makes food go sour, so the food powders are mixed with water and oil only when they are being printed.\n\"Long-distance space travel requires more than 15 years of shelf life for food.\" says Anjan Contractor, whose company developing the printer. \" We take water out, and in that form, food will last maybe 30 years.\"\nIn outer space, there are far fewer choices for astronauts for dinner. Most of their foods--even things like beef or shrimp--are eaten from bags as powders . Scientists hope the new food printer can be used to make more delicious food in outer space, keeping astronauts healthier and happier.\nBut the printer is not limited to use in outer space. Scientists think it could be useful on Earth, too. It could allow personal meals to be made at the dinner table, according to each person's different needs.\n\"Let's say someone is an athlete in the family, and he needs more protein ,\" says Anjan Contractor, founder of Systems and Materials Research Corp, the company developing the printer. \"We can design recipes for him and print out more protein-nutritious food for him.\"\nQuestion: Which of the following is TRUE?    _\nYes or no, is the answer \"Astronauts eat beef powder in outer space.\"?",

        "Article: Some countries have a large number of earthquakes. Japan is one of them, while others do not have many, for example, there are few earthquakes in Britain.\nThere is often a great noise during an earthquake.  The ground vibrates  .Houses fall down. Railways are broken, which causes trains to turn over. Sometimes thousands of people are killed in different ways. About 60,000 were killed in 1783 in the south of Italy. Some people say that earthquakes often happen near volcanoes , but it is not true. The centres of some earthquakes are under the sea. The bottom of the sea suddenly moves. The powerful forces inside the earth break the rocks. The coast is shaken and great waves appear. These waves travel long distances and rush over the land when they reach it, breaking down houses and other buildings. Sometimes they break more buildings than the earthquake itself.\nA terrible earthquake happened in Assam, India, in 1986.The land near Shillong suddenly moved 1.5 feet to one side, and then back again. It continued to act like this 20 times a minute.Few buildings could stand what was happening and the great stones flew four feet up into the air. What kind of building stays up best in an earthquake? The Americans carefully studied the results of the earthquake at San Francisco(1906) and believed it best for buildings to be made with concrete  walls together by steel frames. Such are the buildings that can't burn or fall easily.\nQuestion: Earthquakes often happen  _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"Both A and B\"?",

Radio had, perhaps done as much as any other communication tool. Things of the world can be reported to people everywhere a few seconds after they happen.

Another school day begins, and we all wish we could have just one extra hour of sleep.\nFor lucky high school students in England, they're now going to reset their alarm and get an extra hour of sleep. Instead of starting school at 9 am, students will begin the academic day at 10 am.\nThis is part of a huge study by Oxford University. The experiment will see whether later classes can improve exam results.\nMore than 100 schools across England will join the four-year experiment, which includes tens of thousands of students. It is based on(...) scientific evidence(; )that teenagers are out of step with traditional school hours.\n\"We know that something funny happens when you're a teenager,\" lead sleep researcher Colin Epsie told The Telegraph. \"Your parents think it's because you're lazy and everything would be OK if you could get to sleep earlier. But science is telling us that teenagers need to sleep more in the mornings.\"\nA similar experiment in 2009 saw an improvement of 19 percent in exam scores for major subjects - such as math and science.\nTeenagers' sleep cycles, on average, begin two hours after adults. Neuroscientists   say teens have a built-in clock, which makes them more likely to go to sleep around midnight. As well as not feeling fully awake until between 9 am and 10 am. This body clock stays until the age of 19 for females and 21 for males.\nSchools are places for learning, as well as education laboratories - finding out the best ways to learn and increase knowledge.

According to the World Health Organization, over half the people in the world may be _ . The result of this is not just a lot of tired people; in the United States alone, sleepy drivers cause at least 100,000 car accidents, and 1,500 deaths a year. Problems with sleep can also cause mental   problems, as well as medical problems such as high blood pressure and heart problems.\nAmerican culture values work and often doesn't value sleep. In fact, people who sleep a lot are often called \"lazy\". Many famous men say proudly, \"I only have time to sleep four or five hours a night.\" Students, especially college students, often sleep only a few hours a night. They often say, \"I'm used to sleeping only a little.\"\nBut according to experts, sleep is like money. If you sleep only five hours a day, you don't \"get used to it\", but instead, build up a \"sleep deficit  \". \"It's like a credit card (a card used to buy things or services),\" says Dr. James Maas, \"You are only borrowing time. You always have to pay it back.\" The more hours you don't sleep, the more hours you should sleep to \"pay back\" the hours on your \"sleep credit card\". For example, if you sleep four hours on Monday and then sleep eight hours on Tuesday, on Wednesday you will still have a \"sleep deficit\" of four hours. This deficit can continue for months or even years. People with a \"sleep deficit\" are sleep-deprived. Driving and making decisions can be dangerous for these people.\nAnother research shows people should sleep nine or ten hours every night. More than half the people in the world may be running a \"sleep deficit\". You didn't do your homework last night? Maybe you can tell your teacher that you were working hard on your sleep deficit.\n\"Don't think you will be doing less work because you sleep during the day. That's a foolish idea which is held by people who have no imagination.

It is important to know the ways you can use and to show them to everyone in the family, such as stairways   and fire escapes, but not lifts .\nFrom the lower floors of the building, escaping through windows is possible, learn the best way of leaving through windows with the least chance of serious injury  .\nThe second floor windows are usually not very high from the ground. An average   person, hanging by the finger-tips will have a drop of about six feet to the ground. It is about the height of an average man.

At meal times, it is a good idea to give a child a small part at one time rather than give him as much as he may eat all together. Do not talk too much to the child during meal times, but let him get on with his food. And do not allow him to leave the table at once after a meal , or he will soon learn to eat his food hurriedly so he can hurry back to the toys in his room .

        "Six Chinese Characters\nDear students,  our country has a long history.  Chinese characters usually have more than one meaning and some of them are particularly loved by Chinese people.  Here are the top six lucky ones.  Please note we use \"pinyin\" here because \"pinyin\" is the Chinese spelling system for the characters. For example, \"fu\" is the \"pinyin\" for good luck in Chinese.  \"pinyin\" \"fu\" is only the phonic   ( )  part of the character and if you want to know the meaning of good luck \"fu\",  you must read the Chinese character because \"fu\" also represents     other Chinese characters that sound the same.\n1.  \"fu\" means blessing,  good fortune,  good luck. Chinese character \"fu\" is one of the most popular ones used during Chinese New Year. It is often displayed upside down on the front door of a house or an apartment.  The upside down\"fu\" means good luck comes since the character for upside down in Chinese sounds the same as the character for \"come\".\n2. \"Iu\" means prosperity.\nIt is used to mean official's salary( ) in feudal ( ) China.\n3.  \"shou\" means longevity.\nChinese character  \"shou\" also means life,  age or birthday.\n4. \"xi\" is happiness.\nThe doubled character \"xi\" means double happiness. It is usually displayed everywhere at Chinese weddings.\n5.  \"cai\" is wealth or money.\nChinese often say \"money can make a ghost turn a millstone\". It is to say money really can do a lot of things. But, still-money can't buy everything.\n6.  \"he\" means harmomous.\nPeople's harmony is an important part of Chinese culture. When you have harmomous\nrelations with others,   things will be a lot easier for you.\nWe use  _  to show how to read the Chinese characters.\nA) \"pinyin\"\nB) spelling\nC) Chinese\nD) letters",

It is a world of snow and ice all year round. China has sent many scientists there. They try to find resources under the icy land and study climate change and sea biology.\nWhat do they eat?\nScientists don't have many choices on what they eat. About 60% their food is frozen food. It is easy to heat . Meat is common on the menu, while vegetables are not usual. Fresh vegetables are hard to grow in the cold weather. Therefore, people often eat dried and canned vegetables.\nHow do they sleep?\nIn Antarctica, summer lasts from November to March. During this time, Antarctica faces the sun and gets sunlight 24 hours of the day. In order to get some sleep,scientists cover the window with black cloth to make \"night\".\nHow do they work?\nPeople can wear warm clothes to be against the cold weather, but they can do little with the strong wind. Sometimes, the wind is even stronger than a typhoon. It can easily blow people away.\nSo there are ropes that connect some research stations. People can hold these ropes to keep balance in strong winds.\nHow do they keep in touch with others?\nThere are no cables or Internet on the frozen continent. So mobiles and computers don't work there. Scientists usually use two-way radios to communicate at work.

Take the sentence \"How do you do?\" as an example. If you look up each word in the dictionary, one at a time, what is your translation  ? It must be a wrong sentence in your own language.\nLanguages do not just have different sounds, they are different in many ways. It's important to master  the rules  for word order   in the study of English, too. If the speaker puts words in a wrong order, the listener can't understand the speaker's sentence easily.Sometimes when the order of words in an English sentence is changed, the meaning of the sentence changes. But sometimes the order is changed, the meaning of the sentence doesn't change.\nLet's see the difference between the two sentences:\"She only likes apples. \" \"Only she likes apples. \"\nWhen you are learning English, you must use it as the English speaker does.\nQuestion: From the passage we know that   _  when we are learning English.\nAnswer:",

We have to be careful when we drive them or ride in them.\nIt's always a good idea to put on your seat belt when you're in a car. Why? Think about this example: You put an egg on a skateboard and give it a push. If the skateboard hits a stone, it will stop, but the egg won't. It will fly through the air, hit the ground and break.\nNow, think what would happen if you tied the egg to the skateboard. When the skateboard hits a stone, the egg won't go flying; it will stay safely on the skateboard.\nVolvo, a famous Swedish carmaker, was the first to use seat belts in 1849.\nAir bags are also very important for car safety, because sometimes a seat belt isn't enough. If the car is going really fast and runs into something, seat belts could even hurt the people who wear them. Most new cars have air bags in front of and next to the seats. When a car hits something, its air bags will come out quickly in less than one second to keep the people inside safe.\nQuestion: Which of the following is TRUE according to this passage?\nOptions: A: It won't be dangerous if there are seat belts or air bags in a car.\nB: Now most of new cars still have only one air bag.\nC: When a car hits something, its air bags will come out a few minutes later.\nD: Volvo was the first to use seat belts.",

I spend 40 minutes going by bus, but only half an hour by bike! Now I love riding a bike. And I feel healthy. Many people think my idea is good and maybe you'll see more bikes on the road in the future.\nMany people think in the same way as I do.That's why you see a lot of bikes on the road.Who knows,perhaps in the future we'll have roads for bicycles only.I hope so!\nQuestion: I travel to work by bus for   _  .\n- a few months\n- about four years\n- two years\n- one year",

The first reason is time. Scientists believe the universe is about 12 billion years old. \"This is long enough for other planets to have intelligent life,\" say Shostak and Barnett. The second reason is size--the universe is huge. \"Tools like the Hubble Telescope  have shown that there are at least 100 billion galaxies,\" says Shostak. \"And our galaxy, the Milky Way, has at least 100 billion stars. Some planets going around these stars might be similar to Earth.\"\nIn the past, it was hard to look for signs of intelligent life in the universe.

Qi, together with 10 other classmates made a volunteer group to call on people to join the Clean Your Plate Campaign  .\nThe 11 students went to many restaurants and told people the importance of saving food.\"Excuse me, do you know that 950 million people around the world still haven't got enough to eat? Could you please not waste food?\"They would say this kind of thing hundreds of times every day.\nChina in recent years has experienced serious problems with wasted food. CCTV reported in January that the food Chinese people waste every year is enough to feed 200 million people for a year. It's a tradition that Chinese people offer lots of food when they invite others to dinner. Many even feel that they will lose face if their guests have eaten all their food.\nLuckily the campaign has got the support of many. In a restaurant in Xinjiang, the owner gives the guests who have eaten up all that they ordered a sticker. People can enjoy a free meal when they have 10 stickers. More than 750 restaurants in Beijing have begun to offer smaller dishes and encourage their guests to take leftovers  home.\nWasting food is a serious problem around the world, not only in China. It's said that 2 billion tons  of food ends up as waste every year in our country. This is as much as half of all the food in the world. The UN Environment Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization held a\"Think, Eat, Save\" program on January 24 to help reduce food waste.\nTo reduce food waste is a big task, and it needs time.

This kind of operation is known as robotic operation.\nDoctor Marescaux did the operation in an office in New York City last month, while a sixty-eight-year-old woman patient was in a hospital in Strasbourg, France.\nA doctor in Strasbourg got the patient ready. He placed medical tools and a small video camera in her stomach area. Doctor Marescaux in New York watched the patient on a video screen. Then he used the computer to send messages to the robot machine. The robot moved the tools that cut the woman's gallbladder away. The woman got well soon after the operation and left the hospital two days later.\nExperts say the main problem with such a robotic operation is based on high-speed telecommunications between the doctor and the robot. Technology must be able to send a doctor's order to a robot to move the tools quickly.\nExperts also say a successful robotic operation will improve an operation. For example, the robot can make much smaller movements than a person can. A robot machine can turn tools in ways that a doctor's hand cannot.\nDoctors say such a robotic operation will make possible safer and better operations in the future. They say it will improve doctor training. It will also mean that doctors could do an operation on people in dangerous places far away.

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: Pictures That Don't Last\n\"YEARS ago when I was at the Grand Canyon, I remember someone coming up to the canyon's edge, taking a shot with their camera and then walking away, like 'got it - done', barely even glancing at the magnificent   scene sprawling   in front of them,\" Linda Henkel, a scientist at Fairfield University, US told Live Science.\nHenkel was surprised by how obsessed   people are with taking pictures these days - before dinner, during friends' birthday parties, on museum tours and so on.You know people just like that, don't you?\nThey keep taking pictures because they think that it helps record the moment, but as Henkel's latest study has just found out, this obsession may prevent their brains from remembering what actually happened, reported The Guardian.\nIn her study, Henkel led a group of college students around a museum and asked them to simply observe 15 objects and to photograph 15 others.The next day the students' memory of the tour was tested, and the results showed that they were less accurate in recognizing the objects and they remembered fewer details about them if they photographed them.\n\"When people rely on technology to remember for them - counting on the camera to record the event and thus not needing to attend to it fully themselves, it can have a negative effect on how well they remember their experiences,\" Henkel explained.\nBut there is also an exception: if students zoomed   in to photograph part of an object, their memory actually improved, and those who focused the lens   on a specific area could even recall parts that weren't in the frame.\nSo basically, this study is saying that constantly taking pictures can harm your memory.But shouldn't reviewing pictures we have taken help wake up our memories? This is true, but only if we spend enough time doing it.\n\"In order to remember, we have to access and interact with the photos, rather than just amassing them,\" Henkel told The Telegraph.However, previous research has shown that most people never take the time to look over their...\nQuestion: What is the article mainly about?\nOptions: A: Some skills to learn for taking pictures.\nB: People's obsession with taking pictures and its influence.\nC: How pictures remind us of our past.\nD: How to deal with pictures after taking trips.",

A GPS cannot start your car, but at least you will know where you are.\nGPS, which means Global Positioning System , is a small radio receiver. It looks like a mobile phone. You can hold it in your hand, or put in you pocket. It is sometimes put into a watch or a telephone. We also find GPS devices in cars, planes, or boats. Some of these devices have electronic maps, so you know where you are. For example, in a city they can tell you the name of the street.\nThere are three parts to the Global Positioning System. The first part is the receiver. You can hold it in your hand, or have it fixed into your car, plane, etc. the second part is a group of satellites orbiting the Earth. The receiver contacts at least four of the satellites and calculates its position. The third part of the system is a network of ground stations. They are all over the world. _ control the satellites and make sure they are working well.\nSome people think that in the future the GPS will be as common as the mobile.

It stands to reason that, once in a while, they need to have a good cry. But this is a lot harder than it sounds.\nWe still know very little about space, and about living in zero gravity. In fact, we are discovering new things every time astronauts take to the skies (and beyond). As The Atlantic reported in January, crying is not all that simple in space. This is because when a person normally cries,  gravity makes their tears move downwards. But in a spacecraft, this is not the case. Here, there is no gravity, which is why we so often see pictures of astronauts floating around. This means that, strangely, when you cry your tears have nowhere to go. As a result, they just stick to your eyes.\nIn May 2011, astronaut Andrew Feustel experienced this. \"Tears,\" as he said, \"don't fall off your eye... they just kind of stay there. \" This can be quite painful. In space, your eyes get very dry, and the added moisture is irritating  . Sometimes, things get even weirder . The astronaut Ron Parise told The Atlantic that when tears get big enough, they \"break free of the eye and float around\".\nNo one can be quite sure why we cry. Why should water in our eyes have anything to do with feeling sad? If you stop to think about it, crying is a very strange thing indeed. And now, thanks to the wonders of space, it just got even stranger.",

It's made up of three parts: satellites, control equipments   on land and receivers.\nSpace Technology\nRussian and American scientists have worked together for the International Space Station, (ISS) for a long time. They hope the ISS will provide a long-lasting lab. Such a lab will bring humans limitless   advantages. It's even hoped that one day space technology will take humans to their new houses in space.\nUnderwater Robot\nHercules is a kind of underwater robot with some high technology equipments. It will be used to search for ancient ships which were destroyed into the deep sea during their journey long ago.\nThe world is changing so quickly that it's hard for us to catch up with all the new inventions because they seem to come out every month. It's important for us to learn about new technology and the role that it plays in our lives. So we should be willing to accept modem technology, or we will fall behind the times.\nWhat is the purpose of the passage?\nA) To help us study some new technology.\nB) To tell us technology is changing the world.\nC) To help solve the problems that technology causes.\nD) To remind us the advantages of technology are limitless.",

Because of his story of success, he has become an example of young people.\nMichael Ha was born in a very poor family. His parents worked in Vietnam before they moved to Britain in 1980. They couldn't find work in Britain because they spoke little English. The whole family had to live on benefits  and they lived in a small house in Hackney, a poor area in East London. Growing up is not easy for Michael, but he never gave up.\nAt the age of ten, he set his heart on going to Cambridge University. It was not easy, either. Michael studied at a school, which used to be called \"the worst school in Britain\". However, young Michael made his mind to try his best, no matter what kind of school he was studying at. The smart boy studied very hard and did well in every subject at school. Once he made a bet with his friend to learn further math. As a result, after just spending four months teaching himself from a textbook, he got an A in AS-level further math.\nNow Michael is the star medical student in John's College, Cambridge and has just won an award for his excellent grades. He hopes he will be an inspiration for other young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nQuestion: Where did Michael's parents work before 1980?\n- in Britain\n- in Vietnam\n- in Cambridge\n- in Hackney",

        "Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: Over 30% of the natural world has been seriously destroyed by humans   over the last 30 years. This is because the number of people living on Earth is nearly six billion  . All of these people need food, space and energy. As a result, lots of Earth's natural resources will be used up. When we destroy our earth to get natural resources such as wood or oil, animals often lose their living space. They cannot have enough food, and they will get hurt or die.\nThe World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international charity. It tries to prevent humans from destroying more of nature than is necessary. For example, in China WWF is working with the local government to reconnect   some small lakes in Anhui Province to the Yangtze River and to create  more protected areas so that China's natural beauty will not be lost in the future. WWF works in more than 50 countries, saving rainforests and stopping hunters from killing rare animals and protecting traditional ways of life in areas where they are in danger of being lost. WWF's main goal is to encourage development that does not harm the environment and the animals that live in it. Even though the charity is known all over the world, and a lot of people support the goals of WWF, not so many donate money often. This makes it difficult for the charity to do all the things it wants to do.\nQuestion: Why is it difficult for WWF to do all the things they want to?\nAnswer:",

        "Article: Once a baby cries, the parents will go to see what happened as soon as possible. According to a new study, a baby's cry can make adults react  very quickly, even if they are not related.\nOxford University researchers used the classic game whack-a-mole for the study.  Whack-a-mole  requires people to hit one of nine buttons  . The players must react as quickly as they can to whichever of the buttons lights up at random . It is a game that requires speed and accuracy ( ).\nThe study included 40 men and women volunteers aged 19 to 59. Some of them had sons or daughters but none had a baby at the time. They played whack-a-mole after listening to different sounds, including babies crying, the crying of adults in trouble and birdsong played at a similar pitch to the babies' cries.\nThe volunteers' scores were higher after listening to the sound of crying babies. Men and women had similar scores overall. The results showed that a crying baby gets special attention.\n\"Few sounds make people react quite like the cry of a baby,\" said Morten Kringelbach of Oxford's psychiatry  department, who led the study. \"For example, it's almost impossible to ignore(,) crying babies on planes. This is true even though there are so many other noises around.\"\nHe added that a baby's cry can increase adults' heart rate and blood pressure. This is understandable, because in the course of human evolution  , taking care of babies has always been an important job for adults. When a baby is hungry or feeling bored or unwell, it will cry. As a result, human brains and bodies develop a special reaction to a baby's cry.\nQuestion: According to the passage, a baby's cry   _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"can increase adults' heart rate and blood pressure\"?",

It makes us wonder .if scientists can send a man to the moon, why they can't find a cure for the common cold. The answer is easy. There are exactly hundreds of kinds of cold viruses there. You never know which one you will get, so there isn't a cure for each one.\nWhen a virus attacks your body, the body works hard to get rid of it. Blood rushes to your nose and brings congestion with it .You feel terrible because you can't breathe well, but your body is actually \"eating\" the virus. Your temperature rises and you get a fever, but the heat of your body is killing the virus. You also have a running nose to stop the virus from getting to your cells.  You may feel miserable, but actually your wonderful body is doing everything it can to kill the cold.\nDifferent people have different remedies for colds. In the United States and sane other countries, for example, people might eat chicken soup to feel better. Some people take hot baths and drink warm liquids.  Other people take medicine to stop the fever, congestion, and running nose.\nThere is one interesting thing to note - some scientists say taking medicines when you have a cold is actually bad for you. The virus stays in you longer because your body doesn't have a way to fight it and kill it .Bodies can do an amazing job on their own.  There is a joke, however, on taking medicine when you have a cold. It goes like this:\nQuestion: The scientists think    _    .when someone catches a cold.\n- they have many ways to cure the patients\n- it's difficult to find a good way to cure the patients\n- taking hot baths and drink warm liquids can cure the patients\n- people should eat chicken soup to cure themselves",

The streets where they found her had been her home for many years. Her parents were unknown. They left her long ago. At the orphanage, the girl, like all the children there, was taught to read and write. While she was studying at the orphanage, she learned something else--to be independent . At twenty-one, she left the orphanage and began working as a secretary. And then, in 1975, while she was still working as an ordinary secretary, something special happened. She entered the Miss Hong Kong competition and won it. This was the turning point in her life. Now her name, Mary Cheung, was known to everybody.\nMary entered the competition because she wanted to show that orphanage girls could be something. Winning the competition gave her the chance to start a new life. This led her first into television and then into business as a manager. When she was working as a manager, she had trouble with her reports. \"My English just wasn't good enough.\" She says. Luckily, she had a boyfriend (who later became her husband) to help her.\nMary studied management at Hong Kong and graduated in 1980, She started her own business in 1985. But she did not stop developing herself. She then studied at the University of Hong Kong. Since 1987, she had spent a lot of time on photography. She has held several exhibitions of her work in many places---China, New Zealand and Paris.

But in the USA, each year, students take part in a kind of competition called the Science Olympiad.\nIt has a lot of different events. Students go there to show how much they know about the science of music, biology, chemistry and others. My best event is forestry  . This time, I went to the Olympiad with my school's team. We had worked hard, but this was the state competition. It would be hard to win.\nThe Olympiad was out of town, so we got to ride on a bus and stay in a hotel for a night. The Olympiad was in three big rooms. When we got there, we set up our team's \"camp\" off to one side. The big day had come at last! First, I went to watch the tower building competition. That's when students build small towers and put heavy things on top of it. They hope they can hold them up. One of my schoolmates was putting things on her tower. She was nervous, and in the end it was too heavy for her tower to hold it--it broke! I felt bad for her. After lunch, I helped some teammates with their events. One was geography, and the other was history. I don't know much about those things, so I just watched my teammates do most of the work. At last, it was time for my favorite event--forestry. Another student was also in the forestry event. The rules were easy. We had to look at more than 40 different kinds of leaves and find out which plants they were from. We also had to answer some questions about the uses of each leaf. I knew almost all of the leaves and could answer most of the questions. I had spent more than a month studying on the Internet to get ready. At the end, it was time for the awards  , I was nervous, because the forestry awards were last. We won second place in the whole state! A nice man gave me a medal and smiled at me.\nI had a great time at the Science Olympiad. I can't wait for next year!\nChoose the best answer according to the passage.\nQuestion: Which of the following is true?\nOptions: A: When people talk about Olympics, they never think of the sports games.\nB: The writer got some help from others in getting ready for the competition.\nC: No one thinks the Olympics has anything to do with science.\nD: The writer thought the competition was difficult.",

Teens should get 60 minutes or more of physical activity a day. Note the word \"activity\". As long as you're getting your body moving, it doesn't have to mean doing difficult exercise or going to the sports hall every day. All that matters is that each week you get the right balance of activity, including aerobics  , strength building, and flexibility   exercise. Make exercise a habit by arranging some time every day.\nOn days when you have soccer practice or an aerobics class, you may have no trouble exercising for an hour or more. But most of us are busy, and 60 minutes a day for exercise seems like a lot of time. The good news is that it's OK to divide it into shorter exercise breaks throughout the day.\nJust as you might have a healthy snack to stop yourself from getting hungry, exercise snacks can keep energy levels high. So get up 15 minutes early and do some stretching   activity. Walk fast or run slowly for 15 minutes after lunch. Do the same thing after school -- or walk or bike home. Add to that taking the stairs, PE class, and walking between classes during the day, and you've probably reached your 60 minutes.\nHere are five simple ways to make an exercise lifestyle change:\nQuestion: The writer thinks many people probably misunderstand the word\"activity\" to be \"  _  \".\n- physical activity\n- body movement\n- sports hall exercise\n- outdoor exercise",

Why do you seem to learn faster in some classes while more slowly in others? One reason you may not know is that people have different types. Scientists say there are three different learning types: Visual ,Auditory ,and Kinesthetic  . \nVisual learners learn best by seeing. If you seem to easily remember information from pictures, graphs ,and videos, you are probably a visual learner. You're not good at copying down what the teacher says in class. Never mind. You can draw graphs or pictures instead, if you find that works better for you.\nAuditory learners learn best by hearing. If you seem to easily remember things by hearing them, then you are probably an auditory learner. You must listen carefully while the teacher is speaking because it's the easiest way for you to learn . Sometimes you may find that taking notes tops you from listening carefully. After class, you can write down what you remember or borrow your friend's notes to copy.\nKinesthetic learners learn best by doing. If you seem to learn best by working with your hands, you are probably a kinesthetic learner. Taking notes by writing can make you pay close attention to information as you receive it. Of course, you can learn best by making full use of labs or other class activities.\nHope you learn better by knowing what your personal learning type is.\nOptions:\nA auditory learner\nB visual learner\nC strange leaner\nD usual learner\nAnswer:\nA auditory learner\nQuestion:",

Some examples of American fast food are hamburgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, fried chicken, and so on. Some types of international fast foods might be German sausage and Schnitzel, Italian pizza, Japanese sushi and tempura, Chinese eggrolls and noodles and the like. The variety of fast foods all over the world is growing. Even so, this kind of style is becoming worldwide. Fast-food places usually prepare and serve the items quickly. Many are part of fast-food chains (eating places with the same name and company owner). For example, the biggest and most famous American fast-food chain serves hamburgers in nearly every part of the world.\nFor several reasons, many people choose fast food. First, it is quick and convenient. Second, it is cheaper than special home-cooked meals or formal restaurant dinners. And third, it is easy to find every eating place with the same company name. The atmosphere and style of most fast-food places is casual, comfortable, and familiar.\nWhy do other eaters stay away from this fast, easy kind of nourishment? The main reason is its low nutritional value. Fast food doesn't have large amounts of fiber, vitamins, minerals, and the like-elements necessary for good nutrition and health. In contrast  , most types of fast food have a lot of fat, sugar, or salt in them. Possibly, these things can cause or increase health disorders, like heart disease, and some kinds of cancer.

But there is a new mobile game that may change your opinion about it, and you might even learn something while you play it-Meet Sortee.\nMeet Sortee is a puzzle game developed by Flow Studio, a UK company. It makes you think deeply about everyday objects and their meanings.\nThe rule of the game is quite simple. Two bins are placed on either side of the screen. Each of the bins has a label   next to it and the label explains what it is for. When an object, such as a car or an apple, appears on the screen, you need to decide which bin it should be sorted into and then send it there by moving your finger.\nThe game seems easy enough at first. But as you move on to more levels, it gets harder. The number of bins increases to three or four and the time given gets shorter. You need to think and move faster. That can be really difficult.\nThere are 400 0bjects in total and more than 100 bins in the game.  The more objects you correctly sort, the more game coins you can get It's a bit like working in a rubbish recycling center,  but it has no bad smell.\nYou can download the free game from Apple's app store  ,  but it only lets you play the first few levels. If you want to open the next 40 levels, you need to pay 6 yuan for the full game.\nWhich of the following can we infer   from the passage?\nA) You can play the full game for free.\nB) You can play the full game easily.\nC) There are only 2 bins in each level.\nD) There are over 40 levels in the game.",

        "Read the following article and answer the question.\nArticle: American English is full of colorful expressions. One such expression is to touch all bases.\nThere are four bases in baseball - first, second, third and home plate. When a baseball player hits the ball, he must run to each base - in order - and touch it with his foot. It is the only way to get a point. If the player hits the ball and fails to touch all the bases, the point will not be counted.\nThe importance of touching all the bases was shown at the start of the 1974 baseball seasons.\nHank Aaron was a player with the Atlanta Braves team. He was trying to find the record for hitting the most home runs  . Aaron needed just one home run to be well matched with the record held by Babe Ruth, the greatest hitter in baseball history. Aaron got that home run the very first time he had a chance to hit the ball. That gave him 714 home runs - the same as Babe Ruth. After that day, baseball fans held their breath every time when it was Hank Aaron's turn to hit. When would he hit home run number 715?\nThe wait was not long. In the second week of the season, Aaron again hit the ball over the wall. He had beaten Babe Ruth's record. But first, he had to run around the four bases. The other players on his team watched carefully to make sure he touched each one.\nSo, to touch all bases means to do what is necessary to complete an activity.\nThe expression is used to business and politics. No business deal or political events are really complete until you discuss all the problems involved. Or, as it is said, until you touch all bases.\nQuestion: When a baseball player hits the ball, he must   _   to get a point.\nAnswer:",

That's how millions of people start their day at Laughter  Clubs around the world and many doctors now think that having a good laugh might be one of the best ways to stay healthy.\nThe first Laughter Club was started in Mumbai, India, in 1995 by Dr. Madan Kataria.\"Young children laugh about 300 times a day.

According to a 5-year study at the UCLA School of Medicine in California, with laughing there is less stress in the body. Laughter improves our health against illness by about 40%.\nSo what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to my nearest club in South London to find out. I was quite nervous at the beginning of the class, to be honest, I wasn't interested in laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking silly. Our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands and say \"ho ho ho, ha ha ha\" while looking at each other. However, our bodies can't tell the difference between real laughter and unreal laughter, so they still produce the same healthy effects.\nSurprisingly, it works! After ten minutes everybody in the room was laughing for real and some people just couldn't stop! At the end of the class I was surprised by how relaxed and comfortable I felt. So if you're under stress, then start laughing. You might be very pleased with the results.",

The houses sometimes move about in the wind but the views are fantastic.\nGuests can enjoy moving through the jungle, climbing in the mountains, and watching wildlife. There are many unusual plants, birds, and insects in the area.\nThe Ice Hotel is in Jukkasjarvi, a village in Sweden 200 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle. Every winter, a team of architects , designers and snow builders build the hotel. This year there are 80 rooms.\nEverything is made of ice. The walls, the floors, the ceilings , and even the furniture are made of ice. The beds are made of ice, too, but guests sleep on warm deer skins.

It's very popular -- because there isn't much else to do.\nTo spend a night at Jules Underwater Lodge in Florida, guests need to scuba dive   seven meters under the sea. They enter a small house through a door at the bottom of the building. Inside, the kitchen is stored with food and there is a fridge and a microwave oven .

In India, most of us would look at the reduction  of textbooks as a way out. But in a country like America, there are always more choices. A company called Goreader has created a \"school bag\" which is the size of a laptop computer, weighing about 2.5kg. The Goreader has a colour screen and can \"hold\" all the textbooks that a student may need, says a report in \"The Asian Age\" newspaper.\nThe company plans to work closely with the publishers of test books so that these books can be supplied on the Internet. All the students will have to download their textbooks. Making notes and marking important parts of a lesson can be done just as lots of students have done on their textbooks before.\nAt present, the plan is being tested out in a university. Richard Katzmann, the owner of the company is having his creation tested at Chicago's DePaul University, where he studied. Does that mean it is goodbye to the newspaper, and the smell of the black ink?\nQuestion: What would Indians do to solve this problem?\n- They would reduce the textbooks.\n- They would tell the parents to help students.\n- They would tell the teachers to help students.\n- They would take students to school by bus.",

        "I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.\nArticle: Do you speak English? Do you speak e-mail English? Maybe you don't. E-mail English is a new kind of English that many people use to save time. A lot of e-mail English words come from a computer program called QQ, which means I seek you. Ian Lancashire, a Canadian teacher, likes QQ, \"People can use QQ to talk with each other using computer. But, you have to be able to type quickly or the other person will be bored. So e-mail English can give some help.\"\nA message in e-mail English mostly uses two kinds of new words. The first kind is made up of the first letters of the words. These are called acronyms. The second kind is homophones,letter combination , symbols that sound like other words.\nAcronyms in an e-mail save space and time. It takes a long time to writeby the way. BTW is much faster. Other acronyms are F2F which stands forface to face, CSL forcan't stop laughingand DBEYR fordon't believe everything you read!Some of the acronyms look like strange words, such as SWAK. But this one meanssealed  with a kiss.\nHomophones often use letters and numbers that sound like words or parts of words. For example, 8 sound like--eatingreat, to save time, people write gr8. Another example is CU forsee youor sometimes CU l8r (see you later)\nThe number 2 is used fortoortoo and the number 4 is used instead offor.\nAnother part of e-mail is emotive symbols  which make faces when you look at them sideways. The most common emotive, is the happy face :). A comma   is often used to help add other parts of the face and show different expressions.\nE-mail English is fun. An e-mail message with lots of e-mail English starts to look like secret code . Your best friend will probably understand it, but your parents and teachers may not. In fact, many teachers don't like e-mail English. It's not just because they can't _ what it means. It's because students start to use e-mail English in their everyday writing. E-mail English is great for writing quickly. But most teachers say that e-mail English should only be used in e-mails to one's friends.\nQuestion: What's the title for this passage?\nOptions: A: E-mail English on Computer.\nB: American E-mail English.\nC: The Forms of E-mail English.\nD: The Changing of English.",

NASA, the American space agency, has developed a machine that \"prints\" food. They showed a model of the printer in Austin, Texas last month.\nHow does it work? Cartridges  filled with powdered dough , cheese, sauce, water and oil put the ingredients layer by layer onto a printer bed. The printer bed, which gets hot from below, cooks the food as it's being printed.\nSince most of the ingredients are powdered, they can be sent into space and stored for many years without going bad. Water makes food go sour, so the food powders are mixed with water and oil only when they are being printed.\n\"Long-distance space travel requires more than 15 years of shelf life for food.\" says Anjan Contractor, whose company developing the printer. \" We take water out, and in that form, food will last maybe 30 years.\"\nIn outer space, there are far fewer choices for astronauts for dinner. Most of their foods--even things like beef or shrimp--are eaten from bags as powders . Scientists hope the new food printer can be used to make more delicious food in outer space, keeping astronauts healthier and happier.\nBut the printer is not limited to use in outer space. Scientists think it could be useful on Earth, too. It could allow personal meals to be made at the dinner table, according to each person's different needs.\n\"Let's say someone is an athlete in the family, and he needs more protein ,\" says Anjan Contractor, founder of Systems and Materials Research Corp, the company developing the printer. \"We can design recipes for him and print out more protein-nutritious food for him.\"\nQuestion: Which of the following is TRUE?    _\nAnswer:",

You will probably be surprised how far food travels to get to your plate.This journey, from \"field to plate\", is called \"food miles\". A food mile is the distance that food travels from the farmer's field to the person who buys the food.Nowadays, food often travels thousands of miles to get to the consumer  .Why is this, and what are the effects   of these long distances?\nTraditionally, farmers sold their food in the local market so the food didn't have to travel very far.The consumers also did not travel very far, because they went to their local market to buy the food.This was a good system for farmers and consumers.However, there were some disadvantages.For example, consumers could only buy food that farmers produced locally.In addition, they could only get food that was in season.Now, because of modern technology, food comes from all over the world.We do not have to wait for spring or summer to buy strawberries or tomatoes.They are _ in winter if we want.\nSome countries have to import  most of their food.This is because they have difficult climates.The United Arab Emirates(UAE), for example, gets 85% of its food from other countries.Even food made in the UAE often uses imported materials.\nWhat's wrong with \"food miles\"? Is this not a good way of increasing international trade? I believe these miles are worrying for a number of reasons.First of all, because food travels such long distances.we need more planes, lorries, and ships to move the food.This means we use more oil or petrol, so there is more pollution and more global  warming.In addition, food that travels a long way is not fresh and usually not very tasty.Tomatoes, for example, are picked early and stored for their long journey.For this reason, they are usually tasteless when they get to the consumer.Local...\nQuestion: Some countries like the United Arab Emirates have to import most of their food because of   _  .\n- long distances\n- modern technology\n- fresh and tasty food\n- difficult climates",

Taking a cool bath or a shower can feel really good on a hot day.\nIt is also important for us to drink water. If you feel thirsty, you should drink water immediately. On hot days, you can lose about 16 glasses of water in one day, so many doctors advise that you should try to drink at least that much every day. Mixing a little fruit juice into your water is a fun way to help you drink plenty of water.\nThe food we eat also makes a difference in how we feel in the heat. Cold food, such as ice cream and drinks with some ice, can cool down our bodies. However, eating spicy  food makes our bodies even warmer.\nThe clothes we wear can help us feel cooler as well. Light-coloured, light-weight clothes feel cooler in the sun than dark, heavy clothing. Loose clothes are more comfortable in the heat than tight ones.\nEven though it is not healthy to run around during the hottest time of the day, that doesn't mean a hot day is not fun! You can read stories in your room. You can also paint or draw without moving your body too much.

What inside our bodies makes us grow in a certain way? The answer is DNA. It was first discovered by a young Swiss doctor in 1868.\nDNA is like a computer program for your body. Almost every cell  in your body includes DNA. The way DNA in the cell decides why you are the way you are. For example your friend might have larger ears than you. This is because their DNA is different from yours.\nDNA lives in the cell and is ordered in a structure called a \"double helix \". In each double helix there are links called as chromosomes . These chromosomes are made from four bases that arrange themselves in millions of different ways. The way these bases choose to line up is what makes the DNA code for that cell.\nDNA is also called a \"gene \". This is a very interesting thing. Genes are passed down from your parents. That is why you might have the same smile like your dad's or mom's!\nIn February, scientists found the skeleton  of Richard III, King of England from 1483-1485, under a car park in England. It seems unlikely that scientists could identify a 527-year-old skeleton. However, they matched the skeleton's DNA to a sample from one of his direct descendants . How amazing!\nQuestion: What is the main function of \"genes\"?\nOptions: A: They decide your children's appearances or characters.\nB: They make your children have the same smile as you.\nC: They make your children stay healthy.\nD: They're good for scientific researches.",

That's how thousands of people start their day at Laughter Clubs around the world.\nThe first Laughter Club was started in Mumbai, India, in 1995, by Dr Madan Kataria. \"Children laugh about 300 times a day. Adults laugh between 7 and 15 times a day,\" says Dr Kataria. \"Everyone's naturally good at laughing -- it's the universal   language.\" There are now more than 500 Laughter Clubs in India and over 1,300 worldwide.\nMany doctors are also interested in the effects of laughter on our health. According to a 5-year study at the UCLS School of Medicine in California, with laughing there is less stress in the body. Laughter improves our health against illness by about 40%.\nSo what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to the nearest club in the south of London to find out. I was quite nervous at the beginning of the class. I had no interest in laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking stupid  . Our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands   and say \"ho ho ho, ha ha ha\" while looking at each other. Although we couldn't tell the differences between _ laughter and real laughter, they still produced the same healthy effects.\nSurprisingly, it worked! After ten minutes, everybody there was laughing for real and some people just couldn't stop! At the end of the class I was shocked by how relaxed and comfortable I felt. So if you're under stress, then start laughing.\nQuestion: The writer was nervous at the beginning of the class because   _   .\nYes or no, is the answer \"he knew no one there and was afraid it would look silly to laugh for no reason\"?",

It really is an honor that a complete stranger  would go out of their way for someone they have never met before.\nPeople say that a smile can be passed from one person to another, but acts of kindness from strangers are even more so.

The whole world felt sorry about the death of Mandela, a great man of history.\nMandela is mostly remembered for his efforts to end apartheid  in South Africa. Mandela was born in 1918. In South Africa, there are both black and white people. But at that time, Black people couldn't live or travel where they wanted. They didn't have the right to vote, either. Mandela didn't think that was right.\nHe organized many activities against it, but he was sent to prison for 27 years. Under international pressure, the government set Mandela free in 1990. Great changes in the law began to end apartheid. At that time, Mandela chose to forgive his enemies. He shook hands with the people who wanted him dead. He also encouraged black people to forgive the whites.\nBecause of his forgiveness, Mandela is remembered as a moral model  by the whole world.\nIn1993,Mandela won the Nobel Peace Prize. A year later, he became the first black president of South Africa.\nBoth black people and white people voted. Apartheid ended.

Which country drinks the most tea? It's neither China nor Japan. It's Great Britain.\nIn the wild, tea plants may be 30 feet tall. But a plant grown for market is pruned. Pruning keeps the plant only three or four feet tall. This is an easy height for tea picking. Only the two top leaves and bud of each new shoot are picked. So to make money, tea plantations must be huge.\nIn general, there are two kinds of tea. Black tea and green tea. Black tea is fermented. In the process, the tea loses nearly all of its healthy qualities. Green tea is steamed right after the leaves are picked. Green tea _ its healthy qualities. For example, it may prevent heart disease.\nHow did we get tea bag? The answer: by accident. Tea merchants used to send samples in tin boxes. This was costly. One merchant thought of a cheaper way. He sent samples in small silk bags. Customers would cut open the bag. They would brew the leaves as usual. One customer put the bag into a pot. Then he just poured hot water over it. And the tea bag was born.\nShen Nong was the first to drink tea. (Shen was a Chinese emperor.) This was about 2737 B.C. Shen had bad digestion. So he drank several cups of hot water daily. One day something happened. Leaves from a wild tea tree fell into the hot water pot. The next cup was poured. The water was now colored. Shen sipped it. He liked it. He drank it all. Shen was proud of his new drink. He served it to his guests. Word spread. People thought this way. Tea is good enough for the Emperor. So it must be good enough for the people. Tea became the drink of China.",

But even if you have a short-term memory, it's better than a chimpanzee's , right? Well, you may be wrong.\nTetsuro Matszawa, a scientist from Kyoto University, Japan has showed how chimps have far better memories than humans. \"We learn that chimps have great memories by doing tests,\" he told The Guardian \"You can do things to improve your memory.\"\nHow do chimps have better memories than us? Scientists tested four chimps and human volunteers. They showed them five numbers on a computer screen. Chimps and human volunteers had to remember the numbers correctly. But to make it hard, the numbers disappeared  after seven tenths of a second. Then they will reduce  the time to two tenths of a second. While humans began to make mistake after mistake, the young chimps still did very well.\nWhy do they have better memories? We share 98.8 percent of our DNA with chimps. But during evolution , we lost some of our shared abilities. As humans learned new skills, like language, we had to lose some of our memory skills to make room in our brains. \"To get something, we had to lose something,\" said the scientist.\nChimps need good memories to survive .

        "Write a multi-choice question for the following article:\nArticle: \"Earworms\", some people call them. Songs that get stuck in your head go round and round, sometimes for days, sometimes for months. For no clear reason you cannot help yourself from humming or singing a tune by Lady Gaga.\nTo a psychologist, the most interesting thing about earworms is that they show a part of our mind that is clearly outside of our control. Earworms arrive without permission and refuse to leave when we tell them to. They are parasites   living in a part of our minds.\nIf you have got an earworm you can suffer an attack of it simply by someone mentioning the tune, without having to hear it. This proves that earworms are a part of long-term memory. Humans have an \"inner ear\", for remembering phone numbers, for instance. When it gets infected with earworms, rather than review our plans for the day, or lists of things to remember, the inner ear gets stuck on a few short bars of music or a couple of phrases from a song. A part of us that we normally do not have to think about, that should just do what we ask, has been turned against us, upsetting us with a request that we never asked for. The mind is an inner world which we do not have complete knowledge of, or have control over.\nFortunately psychology can provide some advice on how to deal with an uncontrollable mind. Consider the famous \"don't think of a white bear\" problem, which tells you to try not to think about white bears, or to do something else, to avoid both thinking of the white bear and not thinking of the white bear. For earworms, the solution may be the same. Our inner ear has become infected with an earworm. This is a part not under our control, so just sending in instructions to \"shut up\" is unlikely to be of much help (and has been shown to make it worse). Much better is to employ the inner ear in another task. If your mind is poisoned by Brittany Spears' Toxic, for instance, then try singing Kylie Minogue's Can't Get You out Of My Head. Let me know if\nworks!",

Whynot let everything become a choice -- how we spend time, who we reply to and how much or little we write?\nMany of us are busy becauseour self-worth goes up when people make demands on our time. Whydon't we free ourselves from needing, or even wanting? Why don't we make the best use of the time and space to be productive in a way that it best serves us?

The 3D glasses make the images from the movie look as if they are coming straight at you.\n3D movies are really exciting to watch. More and more 3D movies are coming to theaters. Some say that 3D TV sets will come into our homes in the near future. 3D technology can make TV and movies more exciting. However, people with eye problems may get headaches if they spend too much time watching 3D movies. Why?\nWhen we look at an object, each eye sees it at a different angle  . Our eyes send the two images to our brain, and the brain puts them together. 3D technology uses two film projectors  .  One projects left-eye-image and the other projects a right-eye-image. 3D glasses allow us to see a different image in each eye. So, when we are watching a 3D movie, our brain can't put together the images sent to our eyes. The brain needs to work harder at \"reading\" the images. That makes it easier for people with eye problems to get dizzy   or have headaches.\nDr John Hagan, an eye doctor in Kansas City, said if your eyes can't focus on the same object at once, you will have trouble watching 3D movies.\nQuestion: What is Avatar?\n- It's a kind of 3D projector.\n- It's a kind of 3D TV set.\n- It's a movie.\n- It's an animal.",

It is not just the young, grown-ups have the same problem. One in four people are so interested in their heroes that it affects their life.\nThere are two ways of worshipping  famous people. One way is just to follow them or talk about them with friends for fun. The other is a more serious way. People have very strong feelings for them and think they are their friends. People who do so for fun are found to be happier.

When we knew it might be his last birthday, the whole family decided to get together for a huge birthday celebration at the nursing home.\nDad was a good storyteller and we were always his listeners. During a quiet moment, I announced it was now Dad's turn to listen to stories for a change. I wanted everyone to tell Dad what we loved about him. The room became quiet. Then one after another, people told stories from their hearts, while Dad listened with tears in eyes.\nEveryone seemed to have more than one story. Even the little grandchildren couldn't wait to tell Dad why they loved him. For a man who had been kind to so many hundreds of people in his life, here was our chance to tell him how much we love him. A few months later, at Dad's memorial service, we more fully realized what we had given to Dad that night. Those are the stories people normally tell at a funeral   after a loved one is no longer alive to hear the words. They tell stories, full of tears. But we had given those memories to Dad in his life, and we had told them through laughter, together with hugs and joy. He had them to hold and enjoyed them from time to time in his mind during his last days and months.\nWords do matter, and they are enough.

He has a season ticket and he arranges his work schedule so he does not miss a game. San also attends game dressed in their uniform, and his car is red. He has even lost some friends by choosing to watch the Red Sox instead of going to their weddings. Is this healthy behavior?\nAlthough Russell's case is extreme, being a sports fan can be healthy for you. According to a study at the University of Kansan in the USA, sports fans suffer from depression less than people who are not interested in sports, fans also experience other effects from watching their team play. When their team wins a game, their own confidence and happiness increase, just like the athletes. Losing, on the other hand, always leads to some sense of disappointment.\nWhat about die-hard fans whose team always loses? The team spirit keeps those fans from losing hope. Knowing that other fans are probably feeling the same way also helps them. In addition, there is always the hope that their team will win the next game. Russell has lost some friends because of his love for baseball and although you may think that would make him unhappy, he has made many more new friends because of his team spirit.\nFor Sam Russell, supporting the Red Sox is not just a hobby; it is a way of life and the secret of his happiness.\nQuestion: Russell feels disappointed and sad when  _  .\n- his team loses the game\n- he has less friends\n- he can't go to friends' weddings\n- he has no hope for his team",

He had to go for a lot of training to see whether he was fit enough to travel. He is still waiting for his holiday of a lifetime.\nMany people believe that this is only the start of something new. We made interviews among teenagers from around the world and the following is what they said about space travel.\n\"It's a great idea. I hope space travel will be common in about 50 years' time. I'd really love to do it and I think Mr. Tito was very lucky.\" (Kate from Australia)\n\"I would like to see our beautiful Earth from space. There are lots of secrets to explore in space and I would go into space if I could.\" (Ben from China)\n\"I think space travel is really bad for the environment. Maybe in the future they will make a cleaner way of travelling but until they do, I don't want to go. We should look after our own planet first.\"(Richard from Canada)\n\"It must be very boring and dangerous to sit in that small space shuttle . I'd rather take a plane and go to another place on earth.\" (Lisa from the UK)\nSo, as you can see, many of our teenagers had different opinions. Whether you like it or not, space travel is going to become an important thing in the future. We are looking forward to hearing your opinions.\nQuestion: Ben supports the position that  _  .\nOptions: A: we will explore in space and discover its secrets\nB: we would rather travel on the earth than in space\nC: all of us can make a space travel in about 50 years\nD: we will take actions and look after the earth first",

He has made wigs for the stars of more than seventy movies ,including Tom Hanks in Philadelphia, Johnny Depp in Sleepy Hollow and Nicole Kidman in The Others. One of his biggest jobs so far has designed the hair and makeup for the three Lord o f the Ring movies . He had just six weeks to design and make more than a hundred wigs, each one a different style, color, shape and length.\nThe hair and makeup in a movie are just as important as the costumes or the sets. Over the years, Peter has made actors look older, younger, healthy and sick. For one movie he even made a female actor look like a man! \"What people don't realize about wigs is that we are not always making people more beautiful,\" he says. \"Often we are covering up beauty and making them look ordinary.\"\nAll Peter's wigs are handmade using human hair, so they look as real as possible. This also makes them very expensive -between US $ 4,500 and US $12,500 each! He knows he's done a good job when people don't realize the star of the movie is wearing a wig. So he was pleased when one newspaper said that Nicole Kidman had dyed her hair dark brown for a movie. \"It was a wig and no one knew that9\" he said.\nQuestion: What's the best title for this article?\nOptions: A: How Peter Qwen's wigs change people\nB: Peter Qwen: A wigmaker to the stars\nC: Peter Qwen: Making real and expensive wigs\nD: Peter Qwen's wigs are important in a movie",

Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), did a study on cat colours and people's understandings of cat personalities.\nThe study found that people do judge  cat personalities by color. Scientists did a survey  on the Internet. There were 49 statements   matching five cat colorings with 10 personalities. People think orange and bi-coloured   cats are friendly, tri-coloured   cats are not generous, and white cats are calm, lazy and shy. As for black cats, people think they don't have special personalities.\nBut why do so many people dislike keeping black cats as pets? People think black cats have less special personalities, which might be because of their bad reputation  . They think black cats may bring bad luck, especially at Halloween. Movies and television shows also make people believe that.\nAlthough people have these ideas, UC Berkeley scientists give another reason: people don't think black cats are pretty enough. After all, nothing can show black cats are unluckier than other cats. \"You can't judge a cat by its colour, because it's the personality of the cat, not the colour, that will let you know if the cat is right for you,\" Cathy Marden, a scientist said.\nQuestion: According to the study, people think that  _  .\n- black cats have special personalities\n- orange and bi-coloured cats are generous\n- cats with three colours are friendly\n- white cats are calm, lazy and shy",

More recently, research has turned to the question of how different colors can help students learn better.\nBelieve it or not, some colors can affect a child's IQ . For example, a simple black and white color scheme may cause IQ to become low, while the good use of reds and oranges may raise it as much as 15 points. Be careful not to use too much, however; a little red is exciting, but too much makes people uncomfortable. Bright yellow is exciting to the brain, while the color green is thought to encourage creativity.\nUse blue and green to calm yourself. Blue, especially, can cause you to calm down. Something blue in a reading area, for example, may help you focus  on what you are reading. But too much dark blue can make you sad, so use light blue on walls or large floor areas.\nIf you are struggling to read, try a different color of paper. According to a study, 80 percent of children who had difficulty in reading improved their understanding when they put something grey or blue over their pages. Do not use bright colors here, as they become difficult to look at after a while.\nHowever, use bright colors like red, orange and yellow for important points. These colors attract the eye and may help you notice details.\nThe same color of the walls of a room do not help you focus on your studies, but make you slow in understanding. Colors, on the other hand, make the senses active and encourage learning. Use primary colors red, yellow and blue in a proper way. Then how do you make your choices of color? It mainly depends on your space, the lighting and the function   of the room.\nOptions:\nA What should we learn about colors?\nB Why are people interested in colors?\nC Where should we be careful with colors?\nD How do colors affect our learning abilities?\nAnswer:\nD How do colors affect our learning abilities?\nQuestion:",

But in fact the umbrella was not invented as protection against the rain. Its first use was as a shade against the sun.\nNobody knows who first invented it, but the umbrella was used in very ancient times. Probably the first to use it were the Chinese, back in the eleventh century BC.\nWe know that the umbrella was used in ancient Egypt and Babylon as a sunshade. And there was a strange thing connected with its use : it became a symbol of honor and power . In the Far East in ancient times, the umbrella was allowed to be used only by those in high office or by royal people such as the kings or queens.\nIn Europe, the Greeks were the first to use the umbrella as a sunshade. The umbrella was in common use in ancient Greece, but it is believed that the first people in Europe to use the umbrella as protection against the rain were the ancient Romans. During the middle ages in Europe, the use of the umbrella almost disappeared. Then it appeared again in Italy in the late sixteenth century. And again it became a symbol of power.\nUmbrellas have not changed much in style during all this time, though they have become much lighter in weight. It wasn't until the twentieth century that the umbrellas for women began to be made in all kinds of colors.\nQuestion: According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true?\nOptions: A: The ancient Greeks used the umbrella in their daily life.\nB: Europeans hardly used the umbrella during the middle ages.\nC: The umbrellas for women were made colorful in ancient times.\nD: The style of the umbrella hasn't changed a lot since it was invented",

When we get old, our short-term memory becomes weaker, but we can still remember things that happened a long time ago. There are many things we can do to improve our memory, such as using various memorizing methods as well as taking special care of our health.\nIt is important that we regularly stimulate  our brain to make our memory more efficient . For example, we can do activities that we do not usually do and change our daily habits. Learning a new skill helps our brain develop.\nWhen trying to memorize something, we should focus our attention on the most important things about it. Do not allow other thoughts to enter our mind because this will lower our chances of remembering things correctly.\nOne basic way of improving our memory is to use the link method. If we want to memorize something, we should make a picture in our mind. If the picture is silly, strange and colourful, we will remember it better.\nTaking notes, being organized and keeping a diary will also be useful tools.\nSometimes, memory is connected with our feelings. When something dramatic happens, we usually remember it well, and we also remember where we were and what we were doing.\nHealthy food and plenty of vitamins are important to our memory. Drinking a lot of water also helps maintain our memory.\nWhen we are asleep, our brain stores memory. Not enough sleep can, therefore, cause problems with storing information. In addition, being tired will stop us from being able to remember well. As a result, keeping fit and having regular health checks are both important as well.\nOptions:\nA A strange insect.\nB A colourful letter.\nC A dramatic event.\nD A boring talk.\nAnswer:\nD A boring talk.\nQuestion:",

While the trip sounds exciting, it would take years and years to reach the place that we are going to. So in the future, bedtime for astronauts may be more than a few hours of regular shut-eye. They would have to sleep for years.\nEuropean researchers are now doing hibernation experiments. The study may help them understand whether humans could ever sleep through the years it would take for a space flight to distant planets. \"If there was an effective technology, it could make deep-space travel come true,\" said Mark Ayer of the European Space Agency last month.\nWhat seems like science fiction is not completely impossible. Researchers have been able to use chemicals to put living cells into a sleep-like state where they don't age. They have now moved on to small, non-hibernating mammals like rats. The results will be out soon.\nA major challenge is the fact that cells can be very simple systems, but body organs are far more complex .\n\"It's like moving from a simple Apple computer to a supercomputer,\" said Marco Biggiogera, a hibernation researcher at Italy's University of Pavia.\nJust like bears and frogs, the hibernation of human beings would cause a person's metabolism   to lower so they would need less energy.\nMedical research, however, is just half of a space flight hibernation system.\nThere is the challenge of designing a suitable protective place to live. Such a place would provide the proper environment for hibernation, such as the proper temperature. It would also have to monitor   life functions and serve the physiological needs of the hibernator.\nAccording to Ayer, the six-person Human Outer Planets Exploration Mission to Jupiter's moon   Callisto, could be an opportunity to use human hibernation. The mission aims to send six humans on a five-year flight to Callisto, where they will spend 30 days, in 2045.\n, .\nQuestion: In a hibernating situation, a person needs   _  .\nOptions: A: less sleep\nB: more food\nC: less energy\nD: more movement",

        "There is a famous saying from the French politician J.A. Brillat-Savarin that goes: \"Tell me what kind of food you eat, and I will tell you what kind of man you are.\" It can be easy to not really think about what you eat. For example, whenever you go into a supermarket to buy a drink, it is all too easy to pick up an ice cream or a piece of chocolate as well. You might not even really want them, but sometimes their bright, nice packaging  can be too hard to refuse.\nSo, in our special food magazine we will show you why you should really pay more attention to what you eat! Food not only influences our health but also our beliefs, customs and personalities.\nThe first article will look at the way fast food is leading to obesity  . The famous cook, Jamie Oliver, has made it his purpose to introduce ideas about healthy eating. In a speech, Jamie Oliver told the world that during the 18 minutes that he gave his speech, four Americans would die because of the food that they ate! Obesity is also a growing problem in China. As China Daily reported in February, the number of obese people under the age of 18 in China has reached 120 million.\nJamie has worked for 10 years to try and fight this problem. Learning about food is important not just because of health problems but also because many people still don't have enough food today. And we know as the improvement of science sometimes we have to face genetically modified   food. Don't worry - we'll make you know more about all these topics in our special article!\nWe'll also tell you something interesting about food. For example, do you know what the largest food on the menu is all over the world? It's the roasted camel and it has been served for several hundred years, often stuffed   with chicken, lamb, egg, fish and rice!\nHopefully by the time you finish reading this edition , you'll pay more attention to the food that you eat. As Oliver says, food is something that can help us enjoy our life. It is important that we love it!\nWhere is J.A. Brillat-Savarin from?\nA) America.\nB) England.\nC) France.\nD) Australia.",

Many birds and animals lived beside the water, which was full of fish. Now there are few birds, animals, and fish. The lake water is polluted. It is in a colour of dirty brown, and it is filled with strange plants.\nHow did this happen? First, we must think about how water gets into Lake Ponkapog. When it rains, water comes into the lake from all around. In the past, there were forests all round Lake Ponkapog, so the rainwater was clean.\nNow there are many homes around the lake. People often use the chemicals  in their gardens. They use other chemicals inside their houses for cleaning and killing insects. There are also many businesses. Businesses use chemicals in their machines of shops. Other chemicals fall onto the ground from cars or trucks. When it rains, the rainwater picks up all the chemicals from home and businesses and then carries them into the lake . They pollute the water and kill the animals.\nBoats on the lake are also a problem. Lake Ponkapog is a popular place for motorboats . But oil and gas from boats often get into the lake. So more bad chemicals go into the water this way.\nPeople in Hartwell are worried . They love their lake and want to save it. Will it be possible? A clean lake must have clean rainwater going into it. Clean rainwater is possible only if people are more careful about chemicals at home and at other chemicals on the ground. And they mustn't use motorboats any more on the lake. All these may change people's lives. Only then can Lake Ponkapog be a beautiful, clean lake again.",

The Chinese drink it at any time of the day at homes or in teahouses. They prefer their tea plain, with nothing else in it.\nTea is also important in Japan. The Japanese have a special way of serving tea called a tea ceremony . It is very old and full of meaning. Everything must be done in a special way in the ceremony. There is even a special room for it in Japanese homes.\nAnother tea-drinking country is England. In England, the late afternoon is \"teatime\". Almost everyone has a cup of tea then. The English usually make tea in a teapot and drink it with milk and sugar. They also eat cakes, cookies and little sandwiches at teatime.\nIn the United States people drink tea mostly for breakfast or after meals. Americans usually use tea bags to make their tea. Tea bags are faster and easier than making tea in teapots. In summer, many Americans drink cold tea -- \"iced tea\".

Some people think it is bad,and some people think it is good. Some believe that globalization helps rich people get richer and makes poor people poorer. These people say that globalization helps big companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald's destroy local businesses. However,the people who think globalization is a good thing argue that globalization helps poorer people to become richer. They also think that it doesn't destroy local cultures. These people also believe globalization helps prevent wars. This is because countries with economic connections will try hard to keep good relationships so that their economies aren't destroyed.\nWhether you think globalization is good or bad,it affects the world in two areas:jobs and cultures.\nGlobalization has had a very strong influence on jobs all over the world. For some workers,such as engineers,lawyers and bankers,globalization has been a good development. These workers are able to successfully compete globally and have seen an increase in their pay. But for those who work in factories or in the aervice industry(at hotels,shops and restaurants),it has not been good. Workers from poorer countries are trying to get these types of jobs. They will do the same job for less money. This decreases the pay for that job,so people get paid less to do it.\nCultures have also been affected by globalization. Foods such as Japanese noodles,Inaian curry and French cheeses have spread around the world. We can also see an increase in the use of Chinese characters in tattoos . Some people get these tattoos but they don't really know what the characters mean. Globalization also affects the film industry. Most people have seen American movies.

Polar bears are the largest of all the land predators. They can run across snow and swim in icy water for hours without rest. Their favorite food is seal. Not all big animals live on small animals. Hippos have heavy bodies and huge mouths. But they don't eat animals. They just eat grass.\nSome predators use speed to catch their prey. Cheetahs are the fastest animals on land. They can run up to 70km an hour. Other predators use their senses to find their food. Sharks can see, smell, hear, feel and taste. They can also sense electrical currents( )from other animals' bodies. Some fish try to hide themselves, but with this sixth sense, sharks can always find them. Sharks have smooth bodies. This helps them swim without using lots of energy. They need to save their energy because they never really sleep and never stop hunting. Flying is a useful skill for many predators in the sky. The butcher bird is the most interesting predator. It has a special way of eating its prey. First it kills its prey. Then it hangs it on a fence or in a tree, just like a butcher hangs meat in his shop. Finally, it eats its prey.\nSome people hunt and kill more animals than any other predator. They not only hunt for food. They also hunt for fun. They kill sharks for their fins, and tigers for skins. Those human hunters are the worst predators on Earth.\nQuestion: Why do sharks can find some fish that try to hide themselves?\nOptions: A: Because sharks can see, smell, hear, feel and taste.\nB: Because sharks can sense electrical currents( )from other animals' bodies\nC: Because sharks have smooth bodies.\nD: Because sharks never really sleep and never stop hunting.",

How do you deal with your computers, MP4 players and mobile phones when they're broken or you want a new one?\nMost people just throw them away. With the development of electric industry, e-waste pollution has become a serious problem. According to the United Nations, in 2014, people around the world produced 41.8 million tons of e-waste and only recycled 6.5 million tons. The US was the biggest waster, producing 7.1 million tons. China came second, with 6 million tons.\nIt's important to pay attention to e-waste. It can either be valuable or harmful , depending on how we deal with it. E-waste is a valuable urban mine . The value of the metals, like gold and silver in the waste around the world, is amazing. And the metals can be reused. But if people throw them away, the toxic chemicals  can get into the earth or air, effecting the environment and people's health.\nApple, for example, now recycle people's used products in China when they are buying new ones.

Such an opinion is supported by a research group at Tongji University. _ did research on people's waiting times at different road crossings for three years. They found that Chinese people would wait for 70 to 90 seconds before they lost their patience. \"People are likely to ignore  the light when the waiting time is longer than they can bear,\" said Ni Ying, a member of the research team.\nHowever, a survey on Sina Weibo suggested that people jaywalk mainly because they ignore rules. \"I always obey traffic rules. Time is important but safety should come first,\" someone wrote on his Weibo.\nMany countries give out punishments to jaywalkers. In Singapore, the maximum can be three months in prison . Some Chinese cities have started taking some actions, too.

But do you ever wonder how dogs say hello?\nIf you are a dog lover, you already know the answer to this question. When you arrive home, your dog jumps up into your lap  . It wags   its tail, and sometimes gives you wet kisses.\nLike humans, dogs have five senses  : smell, touch, sight, hearing and taste. Humans use sight as the main sense for recognizing   one another. But dogs have poor eyesight. They use smell to recognize others. A dog's sense of smell is much better than a human's. It is through its sense of smell that tells the differences between different people.\nDogs use smell to recognize other dogs, too. They tell the differences by the smell of pee   and pooh  . When two dogs meet, they smell each other's noses. Then they go side to side, and smell each other's butts  . By smelling its friend's behind, a dog knows who it is with.\nThat is also why dogs smell everything they can on the road. By smelling grass, trees and signposts  , dogs know which other neighborhood dogs have been around.\nQuestion: People have different ways of greeting each other except   _  .\nOptions: A: hug\nB: shaking hands\nC: jump\nD: kiss",

        "Shopping on the Internet is becoming more and more popular. Why do people use the Internet to shop? Some people say it is more convenient. They don't have to leave their homes to order something; they can shop for anything they want at any time; they can find things for sale that they can't find in the Mores near their homes. Still other people say they can find better prices on the Internet.\nIf you want to buy something on the Internet, you need a credit   card. You have to type your credit card number and information on the website   and send them to the store over the Internet. You have to be sure that the store will not use your information in the wrong way. You don't want someone to get your credit card number, so be careful with it, because people sometimes steal   credit card numbers from stores.\nTV Internet is also a good place to go window-shopping. Window-shopping is when you look at the things for sale in a store, but don't plan to buy anything. In window-shopping you can see what kinds of things you are able to get and how much they cost. Some stores like Ross Stores have a website for information about their Mores, but not for shopping. Some stores have a website for information about their stores, and you can shop on line there, such as Office Depot, Payless Shoe Source and Safeway. Some stores like Amazone.com are only for on line shopping\nWhy should we be careful with our credit card number?\nA) Because it will be changed.\nB) Because the store will not use your information.\nC) Because we can not use your credit card when shopping.\nD) Because people sometimes steal credit card numbers.",

But even if you have a short-term memory, it's better than a chimpanzee's , right? Well, you may be wrong.\nTetsuro Matszawa, a scientist from Kyoto University, Japan has showed how chimps have far better memories than humans. \"We learn that chimps have great memories by doing tests,\" he told The Guardian \"You can do things to improve your memory.\"\nHow do chimps have better memories than us? Scientists tested four chimps and human volunteers. They showed them five numbers on a computer screen. Chimps and human volunteers had to remember the numbers correctly. But to make it hard, the numbers disappeared  after seven tenths of a second. Then they will reduce  the time to two tenths of a second. While humans began to make mistake after mistake, the young chimps still did very well.\nWhy do they have better memories? We share 98.8 percent of our DNA with chimps. But during evolution , we lost some of our shared abilities. As humans learned new skills, like language, we had to lose some of our memory skills to make room in our brains. \"To get something, we had to lose something,\" said the scientist.\nChimps need good memories to survive . When a chimp looks up at the big tree and pick a banana, he must remember where he saw it as he fights off competition from other animals.\nOptions:\nA Chimps can remember all of their friends.\nB Chimps have better memories than humans.\nC Chimps do things to improve their memories.\nD Chimps can do many things better than humans.\nAnswer:\nB Chimps have better memories than humans.\nQuestion:",

        "Read the following article and select the best answer.\nArticle: Blind imitation is destroying yourself. To common people, imitation appears attractive; to creative people ,imitation is misleading.\nIn the early stages of skill or character development, imitation is helpful, When I first learned to cook, I used recipes and really cooked some tasty dishes. But soon I grew bored. Why did I have to follow someone else's way of cooking when I could create my own? Imitating role models  is like using  training wheels on a child's bicycle. They help you get going, but once you find your own balance, you fly faster and farther without depending on them.\nIn daily life, imitation can hurt us if we hold poor role models. As a child, if you watched people whose lives pain as normal and gone on to follow what they did. If you do not make strong choices for yourself, you'll get the results of the weak choices of others.\nIn the field of entertainment, our culture appreciates famous people. Those stars look great on screen. But when they step off screen, their personal lives may be awful. If you are going to follow someone, concentrate on their talent, not their bad character or behaviors.\nPeople like the person who is willing to act on their sudden inspiration to create something particular. Think of the things and people that have affected you most deeply. They moved you because their creations were caused by inspiration, not desperation . The world is changed not by those who do similar work before them but by those who do creative work. Creative people are full of new ideas. The problem a creator faces is not running out of material; It is what to do with the material to knock at the door of imagination.\nStudy your role models, accept the gifts they have given and leave behind what does not serve you. Then you can say, \"If I have announced my success, it's by learning lessons from my ancestors' failure.\"\nQuestion: What is the author's purpose of writing this passage?\n- To compare imitation with creation.\n- To criticize the characters of role models.\n- To sow the importance of creativity.\n- To explain the ways of achieving success.",

Every day we experience some of the most important parts of life and may not even realize it: love, generosity, and perseverance. These values aren't just important to us, they make the world what it is.\nScientists say that the gravity makes the world turn, but some people say that love makes _ go around. Love can be found anywhere: in families, friends, even strangers. Even if you can't see it, you know it's there.\nLove may connect people all over the world, but what would the world be without generosity? Whether after a national disaster or a school fund raiser, one thing is certain--- it is better to give than to receive. Generosity is found everywhere and whether it's a large or small act, it makes a difference. Most of all, generosity is not something you need any qualifications for, and no matter what you do, it can make a difference. Sometimes, though, it takes effort to be generous, which leads us to perseverance.\nFounding a country, riding a bike, or finishing a novel, these are all finished with perseverance. Perseverance is the one thing that can help us achieve whatever we want. It is what helps scientists discover cures for illnesses, and athletes become winners. You may fail, but every time you make a mistake, that's one less to make the next time.\nThere is an infinite  number of things we value. But without love, generosity, and perseverance, we just don't think that our lives or the world would be the way it is.\nQuestion: To be generous, the writer thinks  _  .\nYes or no, is the answer \"you find it meaningful whatever you do\"?",

A good teacher works in quite a different way. His audience take an active part in his play: they ask and answer questions, they obey orders, and if they don't understand anything, they say so. The teacher can't learn his part by heart, but must invent it as he goes along.\nI have known many teachers who are fine actors in class but are unable to take part in a stage-play because they can't keep strictly to what another has written.\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?\nYes or no, is the answer \"A good teacher should sit still before his class and speak with his body   language.\"?",

Well, to tell you the truth, it is really an eye-opening experience here.\nIn China, I had English classes five times a week since Grade Five. But I didn't know textbook English could be so different from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut. When I first studied English, I was told to say \"I'm fine.\" when people say \"How are you?\" But in the USA, I found that people say \"I'm good.\" or \"I'm tired.\"\nOne day, someone greeted   me with \"What's up?\" It made me _ I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say.\nSince then, I have learnt more and more differences between Chinese and American cultures. To my surprise, American girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun getting a tan  . In China, girls try every possible way to keep their skin white.\nAmerican students are hard-working like Chinese students. In China, schoolwork is almost everything, so we study hard and that's it. But here, a \"good\" student not only gets good grades, but also does a lot for the public. That is to say, they get lots of knowledge at school and learn many life skills from social   work.\nQuestion: In China, Wang Jun had   _   English classes every week.\nOptions: A: five\nB: four\nC: three\nD: two",

Orphan meant unwanted and unloved.\nChristmas was the one day of the year when the children didn't work and received a gift, an orange. Usually they tried to taste and keep it for so long that it often went bad before they ever peeled it to enjoy the sweet juice. Many thoughts were expressed as Christmas time drew near. The children would say, \"I will keep mine the longest.\" John usually slept with his next to his pillow. This year John was overjoyed by the Christmas season. He was becoming a man and stronger and soon he would be old enough to leave. He would save his orange until his birthday in July.\nChristmas day finally came. The children were so excited as they entered the big dinning hall. Immediately the master shouted, \"John, leave the hall and there will be no orange for you this year.\" John's heart broke violently wide open. He turned and went quickly back to the cold room. Then he heard the door open and each of the children entered. Little Elizabeth with her hair falling over her shoulders, a smile on her face, and tears in her eyes held out a piece of rag to John. \"Here John,\" she said, \"this is for you.\" As he lifted back the edges of the rag he saw a big juicy orange all peeled and quartered  and then he realized what they had done.\nJohn never forgot the sharing, love and personal sacrifice  his friends had shown him that Christmas day. In memory of that day every year he would send oranges all over the world to children everywhere.\nQuestion: What can be inferred from the text?\nAnswer:",
