        "I asked myself how to understand the 'Twilight's success. And I have come to the idea that when you really believe in something, sooner or later it will become real. So, I guess this is what happened with Robert Pattinson. Last year he was just an unknown actor who's biggest role was in a pair of \"Harry Potter\" movies. Now, not only that Twilight is competing with 'Harry Potter', but Robert Pattinson is one of the most famous young actors who sucked $373.4 million from global box offices. So the movie about a vampire boy who falls in love with a normal girl, begun a real hysteria. And Pattinson has a lot to do with it!.
