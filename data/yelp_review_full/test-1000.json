        "It's takes a lot for a business to earn a 1 star and I have this place multiple chances to earn a higher rating and unfortunately they didn't come through. \\n\\nThis store started off on the wrong foot as they never had the items I needed in stock, but then, they introduced bulk ordering which as an added bonus offered a discount  when you ordered a high enough quantity. I was more excited about bulk ordering so I could purchase large quantities to limit the amount of trips I made here since there were several products I needed a lot of. \\n\\nRecently, Michaels removed the bulk ordering process in store, which made me happy that it would now be via online, which is awesome - less gas and less time, probably much more convenient since I'm pretty computer savvy ... Wrong!  This new system doesn't allow all items from the store to be purchased so 20 minutes on the phone I finally find this out and they direct me back to the store. I called the store and spoke to the manager on duty that remembers me and the amount of money I spend with them and said he would look into it with corporate and get back to me. It's now been over 3 weeks without a call back from him. When I called to check in a manager that was a lady on duty had not offered any help to my situation, was short and rude over the phone and didn't care to direct me to get help at all. \\n\\nWent back to michaels today to get a few items I needed and to my surprise ... They were out of stock!  \\n\\nThis place not only has terrible customer service, but can't keep inventory up. Went to Hobby Lobby and not only did they have cheaper prices they had plenty in stock.  \\n\\nLooks like Hobby Lobby earned all my money as a new customer. Big loss to Michaels. Hope they can get their act together.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nAnother disaster. Scummy food in an even scummier area of Phoenix. I have to start with the fact the they WILL NOT refund your money once you pay for something. So in my case, I ordered a famous apple burger extra well done to go with a side of mac and cheese that they claim was baked (it was not). The mac and cheese was pasta shells covered in a creamy cheese flavored sauce, about as appetizing as squirt cheese out of a can. Ok we are back at the hotel room and the burger is woefully undercooked and I call and say I'm coming back and just want a refund, but not here. This is the only place in America where you are forced to get something else because of some dimwit policy of no refunds. So, they are saying if I find a cockroach in my initial order, I'm really going to want to order another item? Insane. Fine, I dash back before closing and order the chicken sandwich. This is a sorry piece of chicken breast on a soggy bun, just like the burger with condiments straight from the year they opened -1956. The french fries that arrived with the chicken were solid grease - not potatoes mind you - just basically heavy potato grease. The crazier thing is they included a free mac and cheese with 2nd  order and that looked nothing like the first order. WTF? This version looked exactly like kraft style with those thin pasta tubes, etc and I'm pretty sure it was (see photo). Will the real mac and cheese please stand up. Then the waitress tells me that she has never heard of any restaurant returning money in her life. What planet is she from and what is wrong with this dump?  Oh, the apple burger was a mess also, sloppily prepared, strange sliced apples on top of cheddar cheese and more lettuce than the big salad on Seinfeld. Two cops were hanging out here and I felt like telling them I got robbed because basically they took my money and wouldn't give it back despite the lousy experience. If I had started this process at 5pm, I swear I would have tried 10 different things and kept saying I don't like it and see if they...\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review: I'm still disappointed in this server. My friend ordered us some burgers and mine is always a cheese burger with mustard only. He came back to the table and we chit chatted for a bit and I looked at the receipt and it said a cheese burger with everything but mustard. I told my friend and he went back up to catch them before they made the burger and right away before he opened his mouth she said \\\"We are already cooking the burgers so you can't change your order\\\", he said ok I was just wanting to tell you that the burger is suppose to be a cheeseburger with mustard only and it's wrong on the ticket. This server had the nerve to tell him that he was lying and didn't tell her that. \\n\\nWow I couldn't believe it when he told me. If it were me she wouldn't have said it again that is for sure. What in the world has happened to customer care and satisfaction? It was such a simple thing that all she had to say was I'm sorry for the mix up and it will be no problem. I really don't think she should be waiting on customers.\\n\\nRudeness is not tolerated by this customer and they have lost 2 good customers.\\n\\nPS: I have her name but I don't think I need to mention that as I'm sure anyone that frequents there knows who I am talking about.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Like many people, we ended up at La Fonda thanks to an hour+ wait at Oreganos. It's nothing fancy and I wouldn't recommend this place for a date night or a night to impress anyone by ambiance, but I have to admit that the food was fantastic. And if there's one thing my family knows about - it's Mexican Food. \\n\\nI had a simple Bean & Cheese Burrito enchilada style and it was delicious. It was moist and filled with tons of beans and cheese and the enchilada sauce was great. My mother-in-law go the salad with fresh grilled pineapple, mango and chicken and it was delicious as well. The chips and salsa were pretty good (I still prefer Aunt Chiladas) but the service was quick, the vibe was mellow and the food was tasty. \\n\\nI don't live in the area and won't be driving out of my way to come back, but I'd recommend it if you're in the area and looking for some good Mexican.\\n\\nNote: the combination entrees seemed a little pricey to me. We each got al-a-cart items which came with sour cream, lettuce & tomato and were plenty big. My rating for this place is",

They sat us at a big round table and we had to wait about 20 minutes just to get our orders taken. We got the food pretty fast, but we were completely ignored after that. One of the girls in the group literally had to walk up to one of the workers just so she could order another order of eggrolls since no one was going back to our table. That second order of eggrolls probably took about 30 minutes to get to the table, which made no sense at all considering the first order only took like 5 minutes. After we were all done and waiting there for a longtime for someone to give us our check, we had to go up and ask the cashier for it, so they finally dropped it off at our table. Even after we put the money down on it, we still had to walk up to the cashier to give it to him.\\n\\nI have no idea wth was up with this place.

Everyone who worked there seemed to hate their job and were unwilling to do anything other than the bare minimum.  \\n\\nThe ER was packed with people and some girl was puking in those pink plastic basins while waiting.   A janitor came by and cleaned ONE CHAIR and ignored an entire row of empty seats.  Sounds sanitary, huh?  I wonder how many already sick people get sicker because the germs they are exposed to while waiting to get medical attention.\\n\\nA few months later, I had a medical emergency and I went to Southern Hills hospital instead.  I was immediately checked in, was seen by a doctor and put on an IV in the first 20 minutes, and I was checked into the hospital in less than two hours.  The ER room there was empty because it is a much less residential part of town.   I also hear that San Martin Hospital on Warm Springs near Durango has a good ER.\\n\\nThey built so many houses in Summerlin and then didn't think that they should have a big enough hospital to accommodate all the people.

I removed the cheese and just ate the crust with the vegetables. I was still kind of dumbfounded as to why this place gets raves. The crust was nothing to write home about, it was just kind of yeasty and chewy. I definitely don't see what all the fuss is.

        "Review: Although labeled as a \\\"pizza\\\" place, this is one of the best rounded Italian restaurants in downtown.\\n\\nThe pizza is great here, but it doesn't stop there.  With calzones, pasta, sandwiches, salads and desserts, there is something good here for everyone.\\n\\nPizza is available by the slice in both thin crust and Sicilian, however I prefer my pizza fresh, so I order a 10\\\" for myself.  My favorites are the Bianca, and the Carnivori.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are large, and enough for even the hungriest of men, but I suggest having it on the homemade focaccia bread.\\n\\nThe salads are huge and big enough for sharing or you'll have some to save for later.\\n\\nParking can be an issue here with only a few spots out front...But us regulars know about the hidden spots in the alley behind the building...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Very close to work for me and the others in my office.  Was excited about getting a steak salad, which I found is a staple here in the Burgh.  The first one I got in July 2012 was good.  I don't know if the method of cooking or person cooking the steak had changed or the meat supplier is different, but after that, I've had two steak salads where the meat was just too tough!  Haven't been back since.  Probably won't go back to get a salad until the meat is cooked tender and not left to become shoe leather.  Not getting a salad again unless someone can convince me that the meat was just cooked and juicy!  \\n\\nPizza's are yummy and pizza lovers will like their small but adequate pizza buffet which has about 8 different types of pizza.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is always crowded  at lunch time.  There is a large turnover of pizza so it's always hot. My rating for this place is",

I was staying with a friend right down the street so Aunt Chiladas became the \\\"go to\\\" place when we didn't want to drive anywhere.  \\n\\nI tried the chicken and spinach enchiladas as well as the seafood enchiladas on different visits.  The chicken and spinach enchiladas were bland but the seafood enchiladas were very good, containing shrimp and bay scallops.

        "It's clear that the majority of Las Vegans have still not discovered the joy of Mexican food from Los Tacos.  If they had, if they had tasted the joy of a Los Tacos carne asada burrito, they would have chased Taco Bell and Roberto's out of town--out into the desert wastelands where people might not mind the dregs of Mexican food.\\n\\nLos Tacos is playing at a whole other level than Roberto's, Taco Bell and the other Mexican food chains around Vegas.  Quite simply, there isn't a better cheap burrito in town.  It's probably because Los Tacos operates under the \\\"radical\\\" notion that fresh ingredients make better food.  Fresh salsa, fresh guacamole, fresh cilantro.  And the steak for the carne asada dishes?  It's tender, seasoned, wonderful.  Simple, quick and delicious. My rating for this place is",

Rainforest murals, lots of hanging flags. Service, awesome, language being no issue. Lunch specials hover at 5-6 bucks, combos 6.50. Comprehensive menu, 4-5 soups, fajitas, even saw oxtail on there. Lots of breakfast options, with no hourly limitations. 7 tortas to choose from.\\n\\nThe one I wanted wasn't on there (huevos y queso) but special ordering it was no problem. It was out in a jiffy, and huuuuge. Huuuuge. I wish I'd stuck a quarter in the pic for scale - easily the size of both my hands, side by side, open. Eating it wasn't gonna happen without slicing it into fourths, which I did. I'd declared my love for jalapenos and was brought a small bowl of (methinks) homemade carrots and peppers, for fwee, which I ate like deli pickles. Yum.\\n\\nSTILL not the sammich I'm searching for, but good. The bun tasted like a really good, really fresh hamburger bun, covered in sesame seeds. Instead of oaxaca, cheddar cheese found its way into my torta (sigh). Still, a tasty rendition. \\n\\nHuevos Rancheros - basically fried egg soup. No rice, so you're going to be wrapping what's hidden under that (tasty, tomato-y) pile of Ranchero sauce up in your tortillas, trying to eat the whole thing before it squeezes out onto your lap. Not the best thing to order if you're a messy eater and wearing white.\\n\\nSalsa is served warm. This was a first for both of us.\\n\\nKitchen isn't that well ventilated, so if the smell of charring beef turns you off, you might want to get take out. \\n\\nAll in all, delicioso! We'll be back.\n\nStars:",

        "Review: Dear Boulder station\\nI would just like to inform you of my visit to your property on Tuesday September 9th. My girlfriend and I decided to attend your 7pm bingo session. The woman who gave us our bingo cards was so nice and helpful the cocktail servers were also very nice. When the bingo game started it was a little hard to understand the first caller but then the second caller came on and it was great. Both my girlfriend and I won a game it was amazing UNTIL the highly intoxicated Asian gentleman behind us pulled out his pens and proceeded to pee on the floor right in the middle of the game! At this time the cocktail waitress was walk by. We go her attention and told her what was going on (Michelle was her name). She said she would take care of it. Moments later the man is till sitting in his chair. 20 mins later after bingo was over he was still there no one asked him to leave no one came to clean up the urine on the floor. While leaving we approached the security podium and told Louis I believe his name was about the incident his exact response to us was \\\"he must spend the big bucks that's why no one told him to leave\\\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME! I am truly dissatisfied with the reaction on your staff. The lack of health concern for a bio Hazzard that was basically just left and shrugged off. I am completely disgusted at how this situation was handled and even though our night started off amazing I will not be visiting your properties again.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: Nice American bistro... not awesome, but nice.  I don't know what it is, but Americans always know how to make things that SHOULD be healthy unhealthy.  For example, I ordered the open faced toasted veggie sandwich and emphasized that I wanted less cheese on top.  I thought that would make it somewhat healthier since I was in the mood for something light (thus the veggie sandwich), but when it came out, it had a creamy sauce that was drizzled over it that I was totally not expecting... and my tummy ached after eating all that heaviness that should have been light!\\n\\nThe buffalo wings are tasty here, as well as the broccoli cheddar soup that I ordered.  Our friends had the angel hair shrimp pasta that was Soaking in sauce.. yet another dish that could have been on the healthy side, but Sadly, was not...  Monday's special of the day (the petit filet) was cooked nicely and tasted surprisingly good with the horseradish mustard that I found on the table next to me.\\n\\nI wouldn't really want to go back here, but the food was decent... not bad, not great, just plain ol' decent.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The gyros here are the best in town, and it's all HALAL which is an amazing plus for any fellow Muslim brothers or sisters. I went there today and ordered a steak kabob sandwich, venturing outside my usual 10 inch gyro wrap. I didn't realize the steak kabob had hummus on it and started having a slight allergic reaction (allergic to sesame, from what I tasted though and for what it's worth, it was a great sandwich with good cuts of steak). I told one of the servers and they immediately swapped out my sandwich with something else without hummus; they were apologetic and did it ASAP with no questions asked. \\n\\nGreat service, great food.

It's down the street from my house, so I WANT it to be good because it's so cute and cozy, but I've never had anything I've actually liked there.\\n\\nI got the burger, which was decent, but it had this kind of garlic cheese spread on it, and when you're eating it on porous ciabatta bread, it has a tendency to leak out the holes in the bread all over your hands. My boyfriend got one of the pizzas, which was burnt on the edges like it had been cooked too long. We also weren't filled with confidence when 100% of the time we've passed by, the cook has been outside on his phone smoking a cigarette. Maybe my boyfriend's food was overcooked because he had to take a very important call.\\n\\nWhen I went for brunch, I had the crab eggs benedict, and it was pretty flavorless. For what I'm paying there, I'd like to actually enjoy my food, but I was so underwhelmed, and since it's always been dead in there and it's got wood floors, everything you say echoes, which can be awkward.\\n\\nOne more thing: when you look at the menu online, the \\\"lunch and dinner menu\\\" is the lunch menu. The entrees and the prices change when you actually eat dinner there. I would have saved money and been better fed by going next door to America's Taco Shop.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "I have lived in Arizona for 25 years and the first 15 years in Tucson.   I have been going to your restaurants for all of these years.   It used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant, I can tell you now it has fallen not only past the bottom of my list but completely off the list of not just Mexican Restaurants but all restaurants.   I will not come back, nor will I ever recommend it.\\n\\nHere is what happened.    We came to the Tatum Blvd one Sunday evening about 6pm.    There were maybe 10 tables with people, not busy at all.   I was with my wife and 2 kids, we were seated right away and our waiter was nice enough at first.    My son ordered the #52 as he always does, my wife ordered #24 but thought she was ordering #21, my daughter ordered her customary Cheese quesadilla from the kids menu and I ordered #39 (thought I'd try something different.).   First off my sons, silverware was dirty, (set ups) he simply took some from another table, seemed like not a big deal at the time.   Then when my wife's meal came 5 or so minutes late after everyone else's it was the Vegetarian Burrito not the Fajitas she thought she ordered.   Rather than trying to make it right for her the waiter became argumentative and told her that is what she ordered and gave her no option.    What makes this interesting is she ordered it as #24 but said to the waiter she wanted the Fajitas.   Her mistake but is the customer always right?  Should the waiter try to make her experience correct even if she made the error?   Should we have had the option of getting her the meal she wanted-even if you offered at a cost to us?    I did get my order and it wasn't as good as I expected but it was what I ordered, 1 BIG Standing tray of food, but not a Plate to be had.   Consequently, I dropped a Chorizo covered spoon on my clothing because I had this elevated monstrosity of a serving dish in front of me but no plate to eat of off.     Lastly but probably the most important was my son's dinner.   It seems he had a HARD FOREIGN OBJECT in his re-fried...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: Damn this Chinese food is freaking awesome! I consider myself an aficionado of Asian food, and I've tasted my fair share in both east and west coast Chinatowns and I will tell you this place is authentic and delicious. To speak to the previous post which said that the recipes are different, it's New York style Chinese food, ie it's different, and it is just like NYC style Chinese food and yes, the fried rice is orange and the pork has pink food coloring, it's all good! Couple of things I noticed, first we got 5 dishes and none of them were swimming in grease, in fact it was not greasy at all. I didn't get that bloated-sick-to-your-stomach feeling that I get with most of the run of the mill Chinese food that's sold here. Second, they use real chicken and not that weird, white, frozen chicken \\\"food product\\\" that all the Chinese restaurants seem to be using these days. It's cheap and they deliver. Seriously? We ordered pork egg foo young, most places use frozen patties, this was definitely homemade and not frozen. A lot of places put the filling in the gravy on top of a plain egg patty with sprouts but they put the filling inside the patty which is way better. We also had a combo plate with spicy chili shrimp, pepper steak, chicken stick and fried rice, awesome. Then we had garlic pork and tomato beef. All of it was really good. This is my new go-to Chinese food restaurant!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Our food came with a salad (iceburg sopping with water) and you had a choice of ranch or some other vinegarette.  We both got ranch and it tasted like mayo with water.  The bread was one of those rolls that you get for Thanksgiving and a piece of French bread.  Nothing impressive that makes you want to binge.\\n\\nOur food came really fast.

I can't say that is a good thing or a bad thing because I love fish and there seemed to be plenty of it but I don't want to smell it while I'm purchasing chicken!  LOL   \\n\\nLove the idea of separating regional foods in each aisle, i.e., Filipino food in one aisle, Thai products in another aisle and Indonesian favorites in another;  it makes it easier to get the right stuff!\\n\\nIts the place to go for boneless chicken thighs!

        "Like Chili's and TGIFriday's, O'Charley's is a casual sitdown restaurant chain.  Unlike Chili's and TGIFriday's, O'Charley's menu options leave a little something to be desired.  Granted, we didn't have one of their dinner entrees; we went for lunch and ordered from their \\\"lunch combo\\\" menu which consists of soups, salads, and sandwiches.  I ordered the Caesar salad and \\\"overloaded\\\" potato soup.  I'm not sure what the soup was overloaded with.  Calories, maybe?  Preservatives?  It certainly wasn't jam-packed with ingredients.  There were some slices of potato and some pieces of chopped bacon, but they looked sparse sitting in the thin, somewhat-cheesy, creamed soup base.  It looked and tasted like it was fresh...out of a can.  If that's your \\\"signature\\\" soup, wouldn't you want people to rave about it?  The Caesar salad was pretty average, too.  It's hard to make a Caesar salad bad, though.  But you can \\\"wow\\\" it by having thick creamy full-of-flavor dressing instead of the runny, bland stuff.   So, basically, everything was just very average.  The service was great, though.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  But that's not enough to bring me back for lunch. My rating for this place is",

Never asked any intro questions, never offered blood/urine tests (which I found out later, were 100% needed) made up some crazy diagnosis that had nothing to do with the problem at hand and sent me on my way with antibiotics.

And even then they really were not ready to serve customers.  I got my coffee fairly quick, then my orange juice, then my bread (muffin) and finally about 7:30 my breakfast entree.  The waitress even apologized for the excessive wait time.\\n\\nThe food itself was ok.  I had chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs, fruit and a muffin.  The muffin was applesauce something and was really good and huge.  The gravy was sort of thin.  None of the flavors stood out.  Being a little more expensive than some other breakfast spots I expected more taste.

The service is always great! However I've never joined them for dinner and don't think I ever will.

        "I met a group of girls here for dinner last night, and my initial first impressions were very positive.  The space was attractive, with a nice bar area and bottles of wine decoratively placed on display.  Some of the wine was reasonably priced, and the wine list included descriptive words below each type, like \\\"dry, food-friendly, hints of pear.\\\"  Very helpful to a wine ignoramus like me.  There was only one bartender at 730 pm, and he was quite busy so it was difficult to get his attention.  One of my friends also was given a dirty glass with smudges on it at first, but as soon as we managed to signal the busy bartender, he fixed it quickly.\\n\\nOur server was very friendly and cheerful.  She didn't rush us, and made good wine recommendations.  We had to ask for water, which I thought was a bit weird since the table was pre-set with empty water glasses.  I just assumed someone would be round with a pitcher, but that was not the case.\\n\\nWe started with the artichoke dip, which was pretty good - your usual creamy dip with artichoke hearts and spinach.  It was served with some little slices of french bread, and was a pretty decent appetizer.  For my entree, I got the Danish burger, and here's where things took a major tumble.  The burger supposedly had \\\"herbed caper relish and bleu cheese.\\\"  Now tell me - how flavorful does that sound?  It sounds pungent, sharp, and just what I was in the mood for.  What I received was one of the most bland burgers I had ever eaten.  Seriously.  What.  Was.  The deal?\\n\\nIt was cooked the way I asked, and taking the bun off revealed that there was indeed caper relish and bleu cheese on the burger.  But there was a very small amount of it - when I ate a crumble of cheese by itself it was delicious, but on the burger, the flavor just vanished.  The burger was just a big slab of flavorless ground beef.  I couldn't taste salt, pepper, garlic, anything.  I had to put ketchup on it!  KETCHUP!  Normally that's not weird, but on a burger with bleu cheese and caper relish, I...\nSo I would like to give it",

It is easy to see why it is a favorite (Restaurant was packed at Noon on a Wednesday) as it is just a nice \\\"bowl of love,\\\" at an amazing price ($4.50) but was not nearly as memorable as my Phavorite Pho Places and not what I am looking for in Phlavorful Pho. \\n\\nSpring Rolls (Shrimp this time recommended by waiter) were excellent.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: I've been coming to China China with my family for many years now.     The restaurant is in an old building, located in an old part of town, but don't let the facade deceive you.  If you pass up this restaurant while driving by, you'll regret it!  There's no doubt in my mind that their Chinese food is among the very best in the Valley.  I've never had a meal there that didn't satisfy me.\\n\\nThey have a wide menu with many offerings to choose from; a great variety of items in chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, noodles, and vegetables.  They also have lunch and dinner combos which come with an entree, soup, fried rice, and a side item.  I have many favorite meals here, but the one that I get most often is the house lo mein which is soft noodles with a little bit of everything thrown in.  It's very good and well worth a try!  \\n\\nPerhaps the only thing that can rival the food is the service.  The manager here works every day and takes the time to get to know you.  Very personable and always friendly.  If you come in often enough, they'll even remember what you like to drink and have it prompt!  Prices are mostly inexpensive.  Dinner entrees start around $6 and run up to about $13 per plate.  If you don't feel like dining in, they also have take out available. \\n\\nIf nothing else, try China China once.  I'm sure you'll leave happy!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nI will never use another Pure Fitness gym again. This review isn't specific to this gym, but applies to all Pure Fitness locations. I posted this here because this is where the event took place. \\n\\nOriginally my dues for Pure were $19 a month which gave me access to all gyms, classes, etc. I decided to add on a personal trainer at a rate of $50 an hour. I would see the trainer about 1 to 2 times a week. Several months ago, Pure Fitness announced that they would start a new program where you would get a 30 minute training session every week if you raised your dues to $29 a month. Sounded like a great deal to me, so I signed up. The program was going great for about 2 months. At that point my trainer advised me that the program had grown so much that they are turning it into an hour long GROUP sessions. Basically you don't have an appointment, and you show up at the top of the hour during one of the scheduled group \\\"PFE\\\" classes. You may or may not have the same trainer each time. Here's the thing. My dues stayed the same and Pure Fitness already offered group classes that were included with my membership when the dues were $19 a month. I tried the class once, but it wasn't the same as the 30 minutes one-on-one that got me to sign up for the \\\"Pure Fitness Experience\\\" program. After wards they changed the schedule of the \\\"PFE\\\" classes that I just said screw it. I canceled my membership at that point. My membership officially expires on Sunday, and I say good riddance.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Stayed here thinking it would be a great place since I have stayed at Omnis before in several other locations. Made a reservation here and was also here for memorial day weekend and was very underwhelmed. The Omni hotels have always ben known to be a very nice place and this location was not up to that standard. It was not horrible but for the price some people pay I would expect better. \\n\\nWhen staying here I ordered room service several times and it was okay, but nothing special that I could not get anywhere else. I thought the food eas delicious though I just think that for the premium price they ask for you would get more. The portions were a nice size though and they always give you condiments which not a lot of places do. \\n\\nThe hotel room in general was very BLAH. Nothing exciting, but nothing gross. Every think seemed out dated and very pale and boring. You think they would have spent more time and money in making it more up to date. The carpet as well was not gross, but just kinda looked like it had been there a while and needed to be replaced. \\n\\nAs a whole, the hotel was a nice place. The weekend I was there I also saw there was an Indian wedding going on. I thought it would be a great place to hold a venue, but I would not want my guest to stay in the room I did if they are all pretty much similar. I also felt that the 3 stars is mainly due to the rooftop pool they had which was amazing on my long weekend. That alone could have made the hotel better. I think that if this location spent some more time and money they could live up to the standard that all the other locations do. Charlotte is a nice city and all the other hotels are more up to date. Omni would gain more business if they just did some minor changes My rating for this place is",

It has a lot of Italian-American food...calzones, lasagna, strombolis, and they're all freaking delicious.\\n\\nMy favorite is the mouthwatering double-deckeroni pizza. Double pepperoni, a spicy pizza sauce, and an awesome cheese blend that sends my taste buds straight to heaven, arteries be damned. For the purists out there: Yes, we know it's not *really* Chicago style, but who cares when it's this tasty? You can always get the thin crust.\\n\\nThey also have an extensive beer selection. They boast 110 brews, and you can take a \\\"world tour\\\" of beer. Basically, you can record every drink you order on a membership card, and when that's done, you get your very own witty one-liner on a plaque in the waiting area. Really cool concept, but I offer some criticisms--too many of the beers are stuff we've already had. Do I really have to drink one more of the same domestic drafts to make it? What a chore. There's another list for the various martinis they have, but unfortunately those are hit or miss.\\n\\nThis is a great place to stuff your face, get a nice buzz, and watch the game.

        "Review: Wife took our vehicle in today for a wash - said she was thinking of skipping it because it looked like rain.  Hindsight that was a BIG mistake.  Arrived evening - just after 5pm.  Paid for wash that was adequate at best.  They had the drivers door open on the vehicle when she walked out - pretty normal protocol.  She got in and drove home - only to realize the interior driver's side door latch was broken.  She had to power the window down to reach and release the exterior door.  I was jammed up so she drove straight back.  Spoke to manager - Martin Mejia.  He claimed the vehicle was like that when she arrived, which begs the response she provided 'your employees saw me get out of the vehicle - i would have had to roll the window down to do that'.  He was NOT interested in taking any responsibility and said they had looked all over for her - it was 5:20 and my wife and daughter were inside the waiting area and there was only ONE other customer in the building.  None of what he said was true and when my wife looked at the cashier - who had started to speak up - the manager stared her down.  My wife said 'are you going to coax her into lying now because she knows no one came to find us as you are saying'?  Here's the reality - and yeah i watched Columbo as a kid - was after hours, the cleaning guys on the cars were rockin and rollin, blowing over the windows with big damp rags, one of the rags wrapped around the interior plastic door trigger, and some tugged hard.  End of Story.  Now i get to see if there is any integrity in the corporate office.  I'm not optimistic.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "As far as Mongolian BBQ places go, YC's is pretty damn good if you pick the right combination of sauces.\\n\\nBasically, you can get a bowl for 10.75 or you can pay an extra dollar and get all you can eat. It really depends how you feel. You can try different varieties of sauces and just get small portions throughout or you can pack it into one bowl and hope that you pick the right sauce that you like.\\n\\nI got the all you can eat because... it's only a dollar more. I ended up getting only two bowls worth, but I honestly don't miss that dollar. \\n\\nThey offer a variety of meats - beef, chicken, pork and fish. I was really disappointed that they didn't have lamb because most places I've been to do. They also have a good amount of vegetables. I usually add bean sprouts, celery, spinach, onions (lots and lots of onions), mushrooms and scallions. Sauces - LOOK AT THE BOARD. I guess some people miss it, but they give you a good number of combinations you can do to make the type of sauce you want. Curry, orange, thai, sweet and sour, mongolian, etc etc. I got the X-pao which basically is a mongolian sauce with a kick. I added some hot chili oil to put in some more, but I like spicy food. I really liked the X-pao, definite recommendation.\\n\\nOn the side, they offer some rice, soup and some wonton chips with sweet and sour sauce. Drinks and dessert (ice cream) come with the meal. Grab it and enjoy! (Only warning is that this place is greasy... as all mongolian bbq places I've been to are, so go in there knowing that!) My rating for this place is",

        "This Costco is the worst. The staff at the gas station have been downright rude to me on 2 occasions & the hours are really inconvenient. Closed Sundays and at 4pm on Saturdays? Most people only have time to bulk shop on weekends, even at a business center.  Plus the extra step of waiting in line AGAIN to show your receipt before walking out the door is insulting & a waste of my time.  The door is within an easy glance of check-out. Security on top of their game could just watch and make sure no one is stealing.  Thumbs down!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\n3.5 stars. Recommended by a co-worker. Not AYCE. Food overall a bit salty and slightly borderline on sauce overkill.\\n\\nWe tried two of their nigiri - halibut  and garlic tuna nigiri at around $4.25 each for two pieces. Fresh fish, but too much ponzu.\\n\\nWe ordered two cut rolls. The spicy tuna roll was quite spicy but delicious. So was the eel roll. \\n\\nTried the lunch special. You can choose two entrees and it comes with salad, miso soup, inari, tamago, chicken gyoza and steamed rice. We ordered the chicken katsu (cut into six pieces and breaded just right) and salmon teriyaki ($1 extra).\\n\\nWe also ordered three specialty rolls: screaming orgasm, something gone wrong #7, and taste like my x-girlfriend. The screaming orgasm had no sushi rice at all but was very good. Halfway through though, the sauce became too much, especially if you eat the shredded radish under the fish---it sucked up all the sauce. The taste like my x-girlfriend was delicious but also too much sauce. The best was something gone wrong #7. So so good. It also comes in a dipping sauce, but is perfectly yummy without it.\\n\\nAdd in two hot green teas and I was $81 lighter after our meal. I'd come back again, but request less sauce.

And that is so hard to achieve specially when the place is already full and they still have more people waiting to be seated, they even have a cool machine to make fresh orange juice, wow, to me, that's awesome. \\n\\nMy top combos are, the garden skillet, which comes with hashbrowns, onions, red and green bell peppers, broccoli, mushrooms and tomatoes, choice of cheese (for me cheddar is the best bet) and I asked for my eggs to be scrambled (always nice and fluffy) and last you choose from toast or pancakes (I always upgrade to an English muffin) it is well toasted and shiny with butter ;)\\n\\nMy second one would be two scrambled eggs with saut\\u00e9ed onions and green bell peppers, Canadian bacon and of course my english muffin, which was the one I had today even though I am not a mommy yet ;)\\n\\nI recommend this place 100% to anybody who is looking for a simple breakfast place with great fresh flavors, fair prices and a wonderful customer service.\n\nReview rating:",

Although she listed Postino Wine Cafe, I was brought to this location and I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived.  The staff was knowledgeable on their wine selection and provided great service.  The cork on my bottle of Pinot Noir had \\\"Wine Crystals\\\" or Wine Diamonds\\\", nothing I had seen before.  The server was very informative on explaining what it was, turns out I did my own research and the information provided was very accurate.  http://winesworld.com/index.php/wine-crystals/68/  \\n\\nAlso, If you are a fan of music, on the Friday night that I was there, they played music by The Whitest Boy Alive, The XX, Phoenix, Hercules & Love Affair and Band of Horses to name a few.  I was tapping my toe as some of these are on my own personal playlist so it instantly gained a few stars for the music alone.   Next, I'm coming back for Sangria Sundays and reggae.

He always answers all of our questions and never makes us feel \\\"stupid\\\" for asking. He also takes his time and even asks us how we are doing. Most physicians these days are in and out of the room before you can even feel like your questions are answered, but Dr. Salek really takes his time. \\nI went in during a very busy day...flu season actually.  My baby had a fever and I called the office to fit me in. They did surprisingly and I saw Dr. Salek. He examined my baby and reassured me his fever is fighting off infection and not to worry.  Well as any mom, I was worried and continued with my questions...I was there for 30 min with him and not once did he make me feel rushed. I even thanked him for squeezing us in and he replied \\\"we would rather stay later to see all our sick patients than to send you to urgent care because we are overbooked\\\". \\nNow that's what I call service...if only MY doctor would fit me in and not send me to urgent care!\\nI haven't seen the other physicians but am sure they are just as good! Also, they are a private practice from what I know so each physician owns part of the practice...meaning they take pride in what they do!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: One of the more iconic sports bars in Phoenix is Majerles. Named for and run by Dan Majerles of the Phoenix Suns, this bar sits just one block away from the arena and tends to host some of the rowdier crowds during the Suns games. Majerles is consistently ranked one of the top sports bars in the country by Sports Illustrated. This accolade is well deserved.\\n\\nMajerles is small but laid out well with the bar in the center with smaller high-tops encircling it with booths along the outer wall. This system works well for the different types of crowds that come into Majerles. There is also outdoor seating and usually a scantily-clad hostess standing with them.\\n\\nNothing special about the menu but everything is good. The Chicago burger, with its blue cheese, is a personal favorite. The bar features the usual selection of domestics and imports as well as specialty liquor.\\n\\nThis is not really a kid-friendly environment but there is nothing to suggest they shouldn't attend. Because the bar is more intertwined with the restaurant and the waitresses are usually minimally dressed, Cooper's Town might make a better impression on the younger ones. The food is better there too.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

At pho kim long the soup is a bit oily you can definitely see the bubbles floating around. The soup comes hot so be careful, it comes hot for a reason because the thin slices of meat have to cook in the soup. The regular size is more then enough for me so portions are good.\\n\\nEgg rolls: 2/5  I used to like their egg rolls until they decided to down size. Their egg rolls used to be fat and thick but ever since they changed their recipe they're friend super small and thin. The size of a lumpia basically, and they give you like 1 slice of lettuce. Everyone knows you wrap the egg roll inside the lettuce and dip it in that fish sauce they give you. \\n\\nService: 1/5 Even if your belligerently drunk service should still matter. This place is very fast paced and when your drunk you just want things to slow down at that point. The waiters are very pushy and they rush the heck out of you. Once you order and they bring your food out forget trying to get their attention later. Flagging down a waiter there just to get your check is a mission there.\n\nStars:",

In Madison, Wisconsin?!\\\"\\n\\nOh yes.\\n\\nWe began by sharing the carpaccio;  served with a shaved radish and pea shoot salad, smoked potato chips, and marrow vinaigrette, it was divine.\\n\\nWe then received a sample from the kitchen:  cold strawberry soup, seasoned simply with pepper, tarragon, and Moscato, garnished with a creamy blue cheese and a few lavender flowers.  Beautiful, and a delicious palate cleanser.\\n\\nFor an entree, I chose the whole roasted branzino.  It was exactly how I like my fish:  perfectly done, simply prepared, and seasoned with a light hand, so you can actually taste the fish.  The accompanying dill new potatoes were fresh, lightly buttery and delicious.\\n\\nMy boyfriend chose the hot paprika crusted halibut, which was really just superb.  The fish - pan-seared, crusted, then finished to perfection in the oven - was presented on a small pile of shredded smoked ribs, all of this nestled on a chickpea puree and drizzled with a demi glaze.  The flavors harmonized perfectly, and the presentation was beautiful.\\n\\nI'm not exactly sure how either one of us had room for dessert, but I'm glad that we did.  I ordered a goat-cheese creme brulee, accompanied by chocolate biscotti, a candied olive madeleine, and raspberries - so good.  My boyfriend chose the cheese platter, which paired three phenomenal local cheeses with sliced apples, quince jelly, and addictive smoked-candied Brazil nuts.  When we told our server that the nuts were, basically, crazy-good, she brought us a box of them to take home.\\n\\nOur check arrived with a little dish of sweets from the kitchen:  decadent chocolate mint truffles, strawberry jellies, and a handful of caramel corn.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a wonderful dining experience.  The food was of a caliber that we sometimes don't even see in New York City, and therefore weren't expecting to find in comparatively-little Madison.

Well my friend, these are trophies for those who come here very often and earn it.\\n\\nAnyways, I came here several times and have been procrastinating on my writing. Thus, here it is:\\nBeer that's unheard of / unknown + Incentive to drink = fun times.\\nNow, they don't only just serve all types of beers but they also have appetizers and food that will accompany your taste in beer to fill you up in that part of your stomach (if the beer didn't fill you up already)\\n\\nIn the end, this place is definitely a place to hang out and just conversate (you'll notice a ton of college students during the school year as UNCC is not even 5 minutes away). Hours will fly by especially if you're curious on what type of beer is good and what isn't. The only problem here I find is that it is a little pricey, especially when you're a heavy drinker. Other than, have a beer or two and join the UFO club and get that plaque!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review: It seems like every mid-size city or bigger has a discount movie theater; and those that don't, definitely should. I've got no beef with the infrastructure or staff at Market Square: the employees seem friendly enough, and the theaters have more charm than your typical mall 16-plex. However, the movie selection at this place is lousy. They always seem to be playing the crappiest crap that was in the mall theaters several months ago, rather than some good Sundance cast-offs or independent films. Even worse, a lot of the movies are parked here for weeks or months on end. I've literally been waiting since the start of the summer for Market Square to show something worthwhile, to no avail. What good is a discount theater with character and reasonable concessions if they're never showing anything you'd want to see???

The whole space has a great ambiance, especially with the lakeside patio. There's also a bar and lounge area next to the shop. Although it wasn't particularly hot that day, it wasn't cool enough to want to sit outside (everyone else did).\\n\\nFIRST COURSE\\n\\nSoup du Jour: Potato Leek Soup with bacon and croutons. The soup was thick, but not heavy and very flavorful. I loved the addition of bacon.\\n\\nFresh Burrata Cheese with Heirloom Tomatoes: Balsamic vinegar, ciabatta croutons, and basil oil. This was just okay. The burrata was nice, but I've had much better salads of its kind. I would have enjoyed more tomato as well.\\n\\nSECOND COURSE\\n\\nPoulet Frites: Roasted chicken breast, fries, and natural chicken jus. We both ordered this dish and loved it. My chicken was slightly dry, but the jus was so, so good! The fries were really fantastic as well (Top 10) and tasted amazing when soaked in the jus. More jus please!\\n\\nTHIRD COURSE\\n\\nTiramisu: Mascarpone, vanilla lady fingers, espresso, and Kahlua. This is one of my favorite desserts and of course, I'm very particular about it. That said, I did not like this tiramisu. I don't know what it was, but I did not like the flavor and didn't finish it.\\n\\nCr\\u00e8me Br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e: Vanilla bean custard and caramelized sugar. This was really nice! The custard was oh, so creamy. Delicious.\\n\\nService was very pleasant and we enjoyed our time. Great spot for a date and certainly a fantastic place to purchase wine.

        "Agreeing with Gabrielle about the weird set-up and ordering process. You make your order to one person at the beginning of a very tall counter, a second rings you up at the end of the counter, then you go back to the beginning of the counter to order any additional ingredients to the second person. Very awkward.\\n\\nGreat location for picnics at the fountain or on Lake Mendota. It's not as good as what you can make and pack from quality ingredients, but it is convenient. Based on the (new) Mediterranean sandwich I tried, PB's flavors are more intense than Subway's (thanks, in part, to their fantastic hot peppers, which you can get as an add-on, but which might clash with certain sandwiches). My sandwich did seem incredibly greasy, though, especially for a sandwich that was touted as Greek-style. And no, I don't think it was olive oil. The bread was not noticeably different from Subway's. In sum, PB is better than Subway, but only marginally. Potbelly does not really stand apart from the other greasy spoons on State St.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I tripped and fell into some mud and soiled my suit and shirt.  I needed to get my suit cleaned quickly for job interviews (it is my new favorite suit and the only one I have that fits well), so I decided to give this cleaner a shot since I'd had a good experience at other One Hour Martinizing locations in other cities.  I dropped off my suit, pointed out the soiled areas, and hoped for the best.  TO THEIR CREDIT, the person to whom I showed my soiled shirt did advise me to try washing my shirt with OxyClean before I paid to have them clean it.\\n\\nAnyway, I went back the following day to claim my suit.  Again, to their credit, it was done on time, and once I finally got it home, it was nice and clean (though to be honest, a dry cleaner returning my clothes clean is not something particularly remarkable).  It was during the pick up process that things hit the fan.\\n\\nI usually only carry my AMEX, and apparently they don't take AMEX.  I gave the person working the drive-up window my AMEX, and after a couple of minutes, she came back and told me they don't take American Express.  Frustrating, sure, but I guess I can see a merchant not taking a particular card.  I didn't have any cash, but I offered to write a check.  To my dismay, the clerk told me they didn't accept checks, DESPITE HAVING A NICE BIG SIGN ON THE WINDOW SAYING THAT CHECKS ARE ACCEPTED!\\n\\nAt this point, I calmly explained that I didn't have a current ATM/debit card (I was waiting for a new one to be delivered from USAA - my online bank), but I again offered to write a check.  A couple of minutes thereafter, I was told to come inside to talk to the owner.  I asked for the owner to come talk to me in my car since I had a brace on my ankle from the aforementioned fall, but it turns out she was on the phone, not in the store.

The steak and vegetable soup also had a strange not good taste I was thoroughly disappointed. The only reason I give this place 2 stars rather than 1 is for the complimentary fresh baked wheat bread.

I used to love this place.  I loved it because it was not only a great brew house but it also offered deliciously consistent food that was served by a friendly staff.  The Kobe burgers and the fish and chips were to die for and the micro IPA and other brew delights were as good if not better than the micro brews in Portland, OR. \\n\\nI cannot express enough how disappointed I am with the old Sonora; with the red chili gone, the only vegetarian item on the old menu gone, and the kicker are the fish and chips!  Now fetching $14, I would think that one could expect an attempt for goodness.  But instead I got a plate of thick ass, dry, white fish that was encased in a cocoon of batter that would rival a sub sandwich.  Do you remember when this place used to have fish and chips that were on par with the UK?\\n\\nWhat happened to you old Sonora?  Why must you compete with Postion's and the like?  You are not that!  You are not a moderately price wine bar, nor are you an Irish pub!  You are a micro brew with delicious beer that once boasted fantastic food.  You were a place to go for the best Kobe burger or English Style fish and chips in all of Down Town Phoenix.\\n\\nNow you are becoming a has-been, a place that if it weren't for the good brew, you would be just another forgettable restaurant.  I used to feel welcome; it was my neighborhood place to go for a few beers and a delicious burger but it seems that I must search out a new place to frequent.

        "This is the ultimate home decor store! And very reasonably priced. \\n\\nThey have the best selection of christmas ornaments around that If you are like me and you buy ornaments for gifts of teachers and your childrens friends you will be glad! BUT you must shop early in the season like right around Thanksgiving because they will be gone in a hurry.\\n\\nNeed fake potted plants of all sizes, making your own fake arrangement, You are also in luck. They have items for your bathroom, candles galore, artwork and even a HIGH HEEL chair!. \\n\\nThey have an array of bar stools as well as kitchen chairs, inflatable decor for your yard!. Party supplies, grilling supplies, kitchenware galore. \\n\\nhaving a kids party or doing a elegant affair- you can find everything you need to decorate, keep foods warm, serve with, beverage dispensers. \\n\\nThey often have entire aisles on clearance so look for the signs!\\n\\nYou can get some clothes here that maybe you want to decorate. Or maybe you need some new throw pillows, or unique foods, or bedspreads, or a new suitcase! \\n\\nThis store is so amazing. You must go here and look, especially if you have that one person on your list that has everything and you have no clue what to get them-- you will find something here! \\n\\nI love this store and wish i could spend hours here\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: This is a small family owned sub shop that's been in the same plaza in this older part of Mesa for over 30 years. This is the original but they've since expanded all over Mesa. You'll find them tucked next to the Dirty Drummer bar on the corner in the same plaza as Wendy's. It can be hard to spot if you're not looking for it. \\n\\nThey have brightly colored booth seating right when you enter. A few feet back is the counter to order. Depending on what time of day, you'll either see the owner working, his family, or your typical high school kids.\\n\\nI've always enjoyed their subs, whether it was as a young child or on lunch break long ago in high school. What I enjoy most is their meat selection and the fact that they have a generous helping of not too tart italian dressing and mayo on their subs. The combination is hard to describe but when it's done right, it tastes unlike any other sub.Their bread is soft and fluffy and they leave out the million and a half vegetables you'll get at other places, making it a true sandwich- not just a bunch of vegetables on bread. You can get your sandwich hot or cold and they have reasonably priced lunch specials btwn. 10 AM - 2 PM where you can get an 8 or 12 inch sub, drink, chips or pickle for between $4.63 - $5.23  They also do catering.\\n\\nPersonally I think the Poorboy is one of the best with Salami, Spiced Ham, Bologna, & Provolone Cheese. I would never think of putting those meats together, let alone eat them by themselves, but for some reason they make it work. I love Krazy Sub :)\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "My advice is DO NOT live by the basketball courts or in the \\\"A\\\" buildings (even though it's the cheapest area and there is a reason why it's cheap). I have lived here for almost ten months and all I can say is \\\"HOLLY CRAP\\\" there is a lot of freakin kids. My neighbors love to smoke pot and it sucks for people who don't smoke. Kids are always crying in the middle of the night and running up and down the stairs. Teenagers are walking around in the middle of the night being loud. There was a car with a busted window so, don't leave anything valuable in the car. My neighbors down stairs are always fighting and I can hear the wife crying. If you need to sleep in the day time, FORGET about sleeping if you live in those apartments...  When we 1st saw the place they took us to the north part of the apartment which is nice and peaceful. They then told us we were in the \\\"A\\\" building which turned out to be a freakin zoo! Kids are everywhere with no adult supervision and the children love to play chicken with the cars! We almost hit some kids playing that game and we get paranoid when we come home. So... cheap apartment = ghetto and headaches. Pay extra money for a better place so you don't have to worry about your car nor your sanity. My rating for this place is",

Yes, I had been back and gave it another shot.\\n\\nYes, perhaps, I was a bit douchy in my prior review. \\n\\nThis place is definitely a great spot if you need a quick lunch, and you are on the go. Its a fairly comfortable place to eat, and it's better for you than a Baconator (although, that does sound delicious right about now).\\n\\nThey tend to water down their Sriracha, but it might be more of a heat thing rather than a cost cutting thing. Sriracha can be a bit spicy for some.\\n\\nThe spicy chicken bowl is the way to go. Try it. Don't listen to my old review. I was probably having a bad day at work. My rating for this place is",

        "Review: I take my baby to see Dr York. Although he looks young (mid 30's?) he is an awesome doctor and knows what he's doing. I always book the first appointment of the day if possible as they do have about 6 doctors on staff so the rooms do fill up quick in the middle of the day. The one late appointment I had to make after work only resulted in a 20 min wait in the waiting room. They play childrens movies on the tv's in the waiting room and have a childrens toy for the toddlers to stand around and mess with. If you do have a medical question for the doctor you do have to leave a voice mail and they return your call within 24 hours. If I call in early enough in the morning I usually get a response that day. \\n\\nI highly recommend this office. \\n\\nParking sucks, but the office has no control over that as its on hospital grounds.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: If you need to anywhere in a timely manner, avoid AAA yellow cab at all costs! I called for a cab to take me to the airport this morning, and was told that it would take 5 to 15 minutes for my cab to arrive. Perfect because i had plenty of time. After 10 minutes I took all of my bags out to the curb, and proceeded to wait for another 30 minutes. Because my 15 minutes cab wait took 40 minutes i ended up missing my flight.\\n\\nI called AA yellow cab asking them for a complimentary ride back home from the airport, and they refused. I was told that they recommend 2 hours for airport pickup, which I was not told when I made the call for pickup. If I had any idea that it could potentially take that long, I would have arranged for other transportation.  The agent was also unable to put me in contact with a supervisor. I was told I would get a phone call three days later after a \\\"full investigavtion\\\" had been done. This sounds to me like customer service code for \\\"you'll never hear from us again.\\\" \\n\\nThere are cab companies in Phoenix that you can rely on. AAA Yellow cab isdefinitely NOT one of them.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Charlotte always seems to have a plethora of Vietnamese pho restaurants in town. With so many selections it always seems to come down to choice and what you like and don't like. Better yet, know and don't know about pho and Vietnamese cuisine. \\n\\nComing from a household that actually cooks pho, I think I know what a traditional and healthy bowl is. Meaning your broth isn't made from concentrate and instead made from ox tails, packs of seasoning that contain star anise and Saigon cinnamon and so on. And most importantly, NO MSG. There's no need to have a flavor enhancer in a broth if the broth is made with wholesome ingredients. And lets think about that. Big old pot of water, ox tails and seasoning doesn't cost that much. A restaurant can easily make their money back by serving one table alone. \\n\\nThat's something I wish they did here. The broth was sub-par and lacked the kick of cinnamon and the smokey aroma of black cardamom. It was just ok. Nothing special and really memorable coming from the soup. The beef brisket was high in fat and the beef tripe was a nail sized sliver dashed throughout the soup. Like I said, nothing special. The garnishes were very fresh though and I was thoroughly pleased with that. Service was attentive and fast.\\n\\nWhat really killed me was the price. Nearly $10 for a bowl of soup. It's difficult for me to even justify that price in my own head. Rice noodles, broth, veggies, and meat. That's all a bowl of pho really is. It shouldn't cost more than $6 a bowl. I don't own a restaurant though, so who I am to say? \\n\\nIf you're in the area and don't have time to make it to another pho restaurant in town, this location will suppress your craving.\\n\\n*They do have much more than pho though and I will definitely come back to try their spring rolls and bun thit nuong.\nSo I would like to give it",

We were givin a casino club card (they call it a Boarding pass) and coupons to use during our stay.

Shuttle to the airport and the strip were both prompt and curtious. Jacks Irish tavern had wonderful bartenders with a lot of useful information to benefit our stay. I wanted a certain type of tequila that they didn't stock at that bar but did not hesitate to offer to find it for me and that was fanastic. The floor workers were all very professional, helpful and smiling. One of the casino hosts was amazing, she took the time to show me around, point out the resturaunts we might enjoy. \\nDislikes......the buffet, from start to finish I was unhappy. All of the food was over salted, garlic, fried...... our server left us for over 15 min without warning, we all sat with empty drinks until we flagged down someone else .....the only thing I could say I liked was the strawberry yogurt.\\nOverall, we will be back again!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review: The biggest challenge here is getting your hands on a drink menu. IF, and I mean IF, you are able to obtain one of the elusive drink menus you are in for a treat.\\n\\nGeorge and Dragon is really different than other local bars and pubs. It's owned by a true Brit with a real cockney accent and run by a bunch of tatted up punk rock looking girls. The contrast of the football flags and the Camden town style of the wait staff makes the atmosphere interesting. \\n\\nThere is a good crowd at the bar. Except for the usual few a-holes you find in every bar, The G & D is patronized by hipsters and business men alike. Families eating bangers and mash sit seats away from rowdy college kids. Stock brokers drink ale next to drunkards slamming whiskey and stylish career gals drinking cosmos. It's a unique mix rarely found in Arizona.\\n\\nThe food is pretty good too. English food is by definition terrible. I lived in Cambridge for a few months and found it hard to digest most traditional English fare, but G & D does a good mix of American classics and British favorites. Even the cold egg thing that my boyfriend loves (and I hate) seems to be a hit with most patrons.\\n\\nGeorge and Dragon is a great place to meet with friends, have happy hour with co-workers or sit alone and stew. Either way you should have a good time in this gem of a pub. \\n\\nDon't forget to try the fried pickles!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Shrimp with chillis and mint I think is number 45 or 46 its tastey and I usually ask for one notch below thai hot so its hot but not so hot. Also I recommend the yellow or red curry. Coconut flavour and never watery just the rite amount coconut and spice. The portions are addiquete. I usually oder these two plates and invariably I always have some ledt over to take home.  A friend that is very much a steak and potatoes guy. He dosent care much at all for thai food. He really likes thai lana.

The horseradish which was provided with the dish was not potent at all.  Even the straight horseradish had absolutely no impact.

        "Review text:\nI describe Ranch Market as the Disneyland of Supermarkets. \\n\\nSeriously, this is not the place to shop too late at night or you'll never get to sleep from all the excitement you just experienced!  The music is loud, the lights bright and festive, and the smell of the food makes your mouth salivate.\\n\\nI mainly shop here for three things:\\n1) I always buy my nieces birthday cakes there.  The price is fantastic for a customized cake for kids.  The selection is incredible!\\n2) If you are familiar with the Mexican baked goods - this place is a one stop shop!  For for a nice change from traditional french bread, try a \\\"bolillo\\\" (a Mexican roll).\\n3)  Rotisserie Chicken.  \\n\\nBut ....just so you know...the produce is great and less costly than Frys.\\n\\nTwo warnings .  First it's difficult to get in and out of the Ranch Market on S. Central on the weekends -- it's VERY VERY CROWDED!  Second, this is an \\\"ethnic\\\" experience.   My husband, a \\\"gringo,\\\" has, on occasion, encountered some language barrier challenges, but has always been successful in navigating it. - so don't let it stop you!\\n\\nThe Ranch Market is always on the tour for out-of-town-guests who visit us from the East Coast.  No way would you find an Super Market like this back there -- unless maybe you were in NYC or Miami.\n\nStars:",

        "Review: Had breakfast here while visiting the area for a football game.  Looked up good places to eat, and BBD was the one that seemed to top the list.  \\n\\n\\nDefinitely a good place to eat...we arrived at around 10:15am and got lucky and just so happened to beat the bfast crowd.  We were greeted by the host, seated quickly, and our server made some recommendations. Apparently they are known for their chicken fried steak, but never have really been a fan of that particular item, so I opted for the corned beef hash and eggs. \\n\\nWifey had the pancakes and eggs, and I got the authentic corned beef hash (not from the can, they say...and they are very serious about that).  It was actual corned beef, not really the \\\"hash from the can\\\" that I was expecting.  It was good, but I actually like the unhealthier stuff better.  The pancakes were nice and soft and very good, even though she opted for the grainier, healthier ones...but it wasn't bad at all.  A lot of the reviews said the portions were pretty huge, but I didn't find them to be that big.  I was able to finish almost all of mine, and had some of my wife's as well.  Of course, we had our daughter with us too, but she's only 2 and she doesn't eat much.  So all-in-all, very good value for the portions we got.  \\n\\nThe coffee was pretty good, had 2 cups black and didn't need anything added to it.  \\n\\nService was very good; quick and friendly.  When it got busy it was a little harder to get their attention, but they eventually got to us without too much of a wait.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

This Sonic's is on West Sahara, about 5 minutes from where I live: definitely in my comfort zone of travel. All the usual fare of Sonic: sundaes, burgers, and limeades. All done well here. I suggest drinking your cherry limeade with a peppermint in mouth and caramel sundaes here. I usually stay away from the burgers and sandwiches because they usually hover around bland. Grilled cheese, tots, and stuffed jalapenos are also notables. Chicken fingers are also decent. I suggest eating here if you're not in the mood for the same old JITB, McD's, or Del Taco. More pricey than the usuals but well worth the novelty of dessert at 2am from a drive thru...namely because all JITB and McD's turns off their ice cream machines in the twilight hours. ^_^\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I came here for a bday dinner for a friend, and the place was already chosen, or else I would have suggested someplace different. It doesn't look very inviting. \\n\\nWe were there on a Thurs. night around 8 and were ushered into the back where the teppan tables are. For one, our table was right next to the kitchen door, which was distracting, and it wasn't busy so we could have been seated elsewhere. The atmosphere was shabby - maybe it was because of where we were seated (other parts of the restaurant looked like they may have been nicer) - not very warm or upkept. It seemed like it had been a while since they decorated. Just.. kind of shabby. \\n\\nAnyway, we ordered some drinks, then three of the four of us ordered meals from the teppan-dinner menu, and the fourth ordered from the sushi menu. Our drinks came at a decent time, except for one of my friends, who later actually had to remind the waiter about it - turns out the waiter forgot. Speaking of the waiter: he was a very nice man, but he kept butting into our conversations! I think it was his way of giving \\\"good customer service\\\" but it got a little awkward after a while, when he kept adding little tidbits and comments to what we were saying. \\n\\nWe actually had some friends that would be joining us later in the evening, but the waiter made sure to tell us that the chef only cooked at the teppan once per table. That's understandable. My friend who ordered from the sushi menu got his food before the tepan chef even came out for our orders, which I thought was a little uncoordinated. Again - it wasn't busy at all. There was only one other teppan table with people and they were on dessert. \\n\\nOur chef comes out of no where. He's not pushing a cart because the cart has been sitting by our table the entire time, as if they had just left it after the last \\\"presentation.\\\" I get that it may be more convenient, but c'mon. It looks bad, and also doesn't imply \\\"freshness.\\\" (He did bring...\nSo I would like to give it",

The stuff here is usually crap, but if you have enough time to dig through the racks and racks and racks of stuff you may be able to find yourself a decent item or two. But wait! I can almost guarantee that that decent item will be over-priced and/or low in quality. Or something you can purchase NEW at an actual store for the same price. \\n\\nI have to admit though I have sold lots of old stuff here. I used to take the credit and hunt for something worthy, but it never seemed to work out so I ended up just taking the cash. \\n\\nOh and another thing -if you're looking for designer jeans this isn't a bad place to look.

        "2.5 stars- It may seem that I don't appreciate the fact that there is a natural food store near my neighborhood, but I really really do. There are some positives to Home Economist on Independence: there's a water refill station, they have a great bulk section and a fairly good supplement section. There's almost always somekind of sale on vitamins and herbal supplements (Wellness Formula rocks!). They have wine and beer. They have pet food- our dog loves the chicken strips! They have sprouting supplies, books and neti pots. \\n\\nThe rub is that the water station is highly unreliable even though they replaced the station fairly recently. Some employess are friendly and helpful and some are seemingly locked into a perpetual bad day. Their counters are cumbersome and don't allow much space to accomodate your groceries. My husband was so shocked at the high cost of bread at this store he walked out without anything at all- this I never thought I'd see from him. But after I looked at the price I was really glad he did walk away. The doors must be manually opened and, with cart, that can be difficult. If Trader Joe's had a bulk section and water refill station I would have one grocery shopping destination per week. The South Blvd location (Home Economist) has shown me slightly better results.\\n\\n1/10/08: I just rec'd my Aquasana waterfilter and all of a sudden find myself less and less reliant on Home Economist.\nSo I would like to give it",

I ordered a shrimp appetizer and it was very clear they were frozen and low quality shrimp thawed and tossed on some poor quality salad.  The tortilla soup was pretty tasty, but not worth the price.  \\nDrinks were extremely expensive for what you got.  My sangria was $10 and was very watered down.

        "Review text:\nLil Porgy's is my favorite barbecue place in town.  It's also my favorite barbecue place overall, and I've been to Memphis and St. Louis.  \\n\\nI think some of the low-starred reviews here expected something different than what Lil Porgies is.  Lil Porgies is solid, delicious food for cheap.  If you want fancy sandwiches I recommend Black Dog instead - and the thirty+ minute wait.  If you want something dryer or Texas style, try Hickory River.  But if you want ribs, slathered in sauce, or barbecue chicken this is where you should be.\\n\\nI'm not a big fan of the sandwiches - they are kinda soggy - and I cannot begin to understand why you would order fried shrimp or fish sandwiches at a barbecue place.  The smell of slow cooking wood tells you what you should order.  That smell brightens my evenings as I drive home each night.  \\n\\nThe ribs are awesome.  There is a range of quality - some days they are just Very Good, but other days they are Amazing.  I think it has to do with how long they sit on the shelf over the smoke - the longer, the better.  The barbecue chicken is also awesome - tender and very smoky.  I prefer the mixed sauce, which is both sweet and spicy, but the mild is more sweet.  They also sell the sauce along for cheap if, like me, you can't get enough of it.\\n\\nThere are some seasonal offerings as well, like chili in a bread bowl or smoked turkey legs.  The chili was good and a reasonable price but I always come back to the pork ribs.  \\n\\nMeals come with big steak fries and white bread, both of which soak up the generous amounts of delicious sauce.  There are daily specials, but the best days are Friday, Saturday, and Sunday - beef ribs, pork ribs, and chicken ribs respectively.  The lemon shake-ups are sweet and delicious, too.\\n\\nI've eaten here many times and never been disappointed.  One of my stand-bys.  When I moved from Champaign to Urbana I was relived that  I was still within a couple minutes' drive of a Lil Porgies.  The building look a little sketchy but it's worth it to stop in.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

Certainly this is not a big box store, but, honestly, I wouldn't give my pets 99% of the food, treats, or toys that can be found in those stores, so, really, Smiley's offers me a better selection of what I actually want than any big box does. (They have a very good selection of toys for cats!)  And Smiley's takes bulk orders and has the food within a few days... saving us the trouble of schlepping out to the 'burbs.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I actually did a lot of research before picking this place. Having one bad experience was enough to learn my lesson and not let the hospital coordinator choose the assisted living facility. I was about to learn another huge lesson: high ratings on a website means nothing.\\n \\nLife Care Center smells like urine as soon as you walk in and you better know where you're going and have a room number because you can't ever find someone that works there. This place is more rest home than rehab...what am I saying, this is a nursing home. The rehab this facility offers is a joke. They wheel out their patients into the hallway and they sit there ALL DAY never getting changed and reeking of urine. It's a pretty sad scene, I cried the first time I came to visit my loved one here and started working immediately to get them out of that horrible place. After a few days of fighting with the insurance company, they won and we had to settle in that crap hole for 4 months.  With only our sense of humor to fall back on we started calling it skid row for seniors.  \\n\\nThe food was horrible.  The rehab was nonexistent.  I had a really bad experience in a meeting with the director, head nurse and physical therapist but it gave me a better understanding of why this facility is so mismanaged.  The nurses try to put everyone in these \\\"protection pants\\\", the best way I can describe them is as a cushioned chastity belt.  Apparently they are supposed to protect you from injuring yourself when you fall but I believe they use them because they keep the urine from leaking everywhere.  We declined signing the consent to wear the pants and the orderly whispered \\\"good, these poor people are too dim witted to know what they are signing\\\".\nSo I would like to give it",

My 11th floor room had excellent view of the Strip, large walk in shower and big new tv.  Buffet is a true value.  Hotel is not for first timers who want to experience Vegas.  Close in but isolated.  If you stay here to save money you're very likely to give it all back to taxis, so you're better off on the Strip. If you have a car this is an excellent choice.  Oyster Bar really is good and priced appropriately.  Expect $60 with a drink for 2.  Counter only, maybe 20 seats.  You can usually estimate 20 minutes to wait per person in line in front of you.  I've stayed in almost every hotel in Vegas over the past 25 years so this is a pretty balanced review.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I was ok that it was a run down looking place, was even willing to go in 115 weather knowing they only had swamp coolers, this is how bad I wanted to try it. I ordered the red chile and bean burrito. The red chile had no flavor and was not even a touch of spice. Either they forgot to put beans in my burrito or they put a very small amount. I was dissapointed in this burrito. I also ordered a dozen tortillas, heard these are sooooo good.  These were good and a huge size. I wouldnt go out of my way for these. I know plenty of other mexican bakeries that make good tortillas. I may try this place agian if someone I know really wants to go, but i will not go out of my way and this is not a place I reccomend as good mexican food. I think alot of the good reviews were people who think taco bell is mexican food. Sadly dissapointed :(\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "If you judge T. Cook's against restaurants in general, it probably deserves 4 or 5 stars, but if you judge it against what it purports to be, three stars is more accurate.\\n\\nT. Cook's is a resort-style fine dining establishment.  The attentive valet parking, impressive entranceway, decor, and certainly the prices prove that.  However, it doesn't fall into the class of gourmet fine dining restaurants because the food is not imaginative and simply prepared.  Nor is it one of the currently-fashionable \\\"modern comfortable\\\" places.  Rather it is a throw-back to old-time formal dining, but done, unfortunately, without the class that such retro establishments must have.  Simply, it seems to cater to an older clientele, probably in accord with the people that stay at the Royal Palms resort.\\n\\nThat said, T. Cooks has many good points.  The food is very well prepared, the wait staff is certainly knowledgeable, and the restaurant is attractive and not too noisy.  You won't have a bad experience here until the check arrives.  Of course, you expected the check because you saw their menu (maybe even online before you arrived).  But after finishing the meal, the net effect is \\\"this was just not good enough for the price.\\\"\\n\\nTip:  before you go here, you might consider buying the Preferred Restaurants of Phoenix card.  Sunday through Thursday (or early on weekends), this gives you two entrees for the price of one, saving you $30-$35, and the card costs less than twice that.  Then you have a year to try about 30 other places.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

But, when we did finally meet a doctor they were extremely friendly and we didn't feel rushed. Good bedside manner counts for something (hence the two stars). Unfortunately, both times I was here the doctors mis-diagnosed my son and prescribed medicine that wasn't needed and didn't solve the problem.\\n\\nSince my son wasn't getting any better I had to take him to his regular pediatrician, who did figure out the cause of his illness and now he's all better.

        "Review text:\nFood: The Italian Pizza was very good. Full of garlic flavor. My only complaint was that the crust was a bit on the tough side. Not crunchy, not chewy; just a little tough.\\n\\nService: I would have given them 4 stars if it weren't for the bad service. It took over an hour for them to finish my take-out order (1 pizza and a side of garlic balls). Also, the lady at the counter was not very friendly. In fact, one of the other patrons called her a certain 4-letter word that rhymes with \\\"hitch.\\\"\\n\\nAmbience: It was nice. Felt like a tiny little italian kitchen.\\n\\nSpecial Note: I do recommend their pizza, but make sure you call it in 1 hour ahead of time.\n\nReview rating:",

It is one of Las Vegas' newer golf courses.\\nMy first time at Tuscany - the Club house was in a converted quonset hut / tent. \\nThey now sport a beautiful club house and restaurant.\\nThe club initially had some problems growing grass in  this arid part of Vegas, so the team from Rhodes Ranch came in took it over and the course has been blooming ever since. \\nRhodes Ranch is the \\\"sister\\\" course and you can often get supurb package deals for plying both courses.\\nThe course is well laid out with a number of sand traps that seem to play right to my driving distance. \\nThere is enough water on the course to splash a few misplaced shots\\nThe course winds past the beautiful stone clocktower has spacious fairways.\\nThe theme of the course centers around wine and vineyards making it fairly unique.\\nI think this is an excellent course for the price you pay. \\nYou have to drive a bit further than some of the Summerlin courses but it is a super experience.\nSo I would like to give it",

I chose a veggie wrap, sans cheese with a side of apple sauce.

She complained the tea was weak, I never noticed.

Boarding the flight the woman in front of me had 2 carry ons and a purse. They yelled at her so she asked to put her purse in her husbands briefcase. Than they jumped all over her about the small bag of food she had which she explained was her breakfast. On flight they yelled at me for having tray table down. They look at the passengers and treat them like they are idiots. They seem to think they are better than everyone else. They say the right things like thanks for flying or welcome or have a good day but its fake and forced. Even if the seats are smaller and unassigned I'd fly Southwest over US Airway any day. At least there the flight staff is friendly, sociable, and genuine.\n\nReview rating:",

Again no flowers, and when I called again they closed before the stated business hours on their website.  I don't know who sent the flowers so I can't even give them a heads up that they didn't get what they paid for.  If I ever get the flowers, they will probably be half dead.  Buyer beware!

I mean the prices at Fry's can be a bit outrageous and while the selection is awesome....you can buy everything in the store ONLINE for so much CHEAPER. I guess they figured this out a while ago and decided that since people just come in....look at the merchandise....price check it.....go home.....look ONLINE....and then BUY it ONLINE.....they might need to make some changes...LOL. I see they are really making a big deal about people taking photographs in the store now....but since they price match now that shouldn't be a big deal. After all people were just doing that so they could go and compare the prices ONLINE. So kudos to Fry's getting a \\\"CLUE\\\" and staying relevant in the valley because if their not careful they will end up on the chopping block like other Electronic retailers (Circuit City....Ultimate Electronics....and coming soon Best Buy).

When I originally called the manager had no idea what I was ordering from. He asked me what menu I was using and I told him the one they had advertised on their web site. He said ok, I'll figure it out. Well he did not and the food was delivered in individual plastic containers as thought I were having a business lunch. Embarrassing is an understatement. \\n\\nWhen I called to complain and talk to the manager I was told he was in the kitchen and too busy on Friday night to rectify the situation and rudely asked, \\\"what is it you want us to do?\\\" . I was told the manager would call me to refund or offer me something in return for my inconvenience but I have not received any such phone call.\\n\\n I spent a great deal of money that night for nothing. Food was cold and tasted bad (perhaps because of the plastic containers) and my guests were inconvenienced leaving me horribly embarrassed.

Well, don't be in a hurry, because there are 5 million (slight exaggeration) people in your way.\\n\\nBUT, they have decent restaurant options, and plenty of them. On top of that, the people in the international area are about as nice as they can be: One of them actually called me \\\"sweetie\\\". I almost broke down crying because it was so nice to be treated so well after spending several months out of the country. I am telling you... the customer service in the United States is beyond. And the CLT is top notch!\\n\\nAdditionally, the airport is pretty small, all things considered. I was at the very end of terminal B when I arrived. Had to head to D, which was the opposite side of the airport. I think that with all the foot traffic, it took me a whopping 10-15 min. Not too shabby... but I will admit that I am a master maneuverer, and walk with relaxed-looking lightning speed. So maybe add a little extra time for the lollygaggers. Nice thing is there're some little shops there in the middle. Relax, check it out. Then be on your merry way.\\n\\nOH! One last pointer: AWESOME place to come in internationally... it took me like 3 seconds (again, slight exaggeration) to get through customs. There were plenty of lines, re-entering through security was also well-organized. It honestly is THE best place (and I've been through a lot of airports internationally) I have ever been when re-entering the US of A.

I love their hot sauces, they are very good! \\nI realized when I hit my navigation this place is close to Goodspeed Performance Lab where I hang out alot so I plan to be back often.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "I know little about windshields, glass, glass repair etc.\\n\\nI was referred to American Glass by Tempe Auto Repair (whom I really like) when my wife's car had a cracked windshield. The crack was getting dangerous and needed to be fixed. American Glass is close to our home and after the referral, figured that this was a good decision.\\n\\nI called and left a voice mail to set up an appointment. No call. My wife called again a few days later and the owner said there was no voice mail and maybe I called somewhere else. She wasn't very friendly. I had the business card and heard the American Glass message. I know where I called. Should have been my first warning.\\n\\nMy wife did take her car to get the window fixed as this needed to be done rather than shop around any longer.. This process went pretty well and the windshield was fixed the same day. \\n\\nThe big issue was dealing with my insurance company and American Glass. This process could have been handled better.\\n\\nWithin a month of the windshield being repaired  a rock hit my wife's windshield again and left a ding. My insurance company (State Farm) advised us to contact the Glass Company to repair the windshield as this should be under warranty and be fixed without cost or little cost..\\n\\nWe contacted American Glass and we were told that it would not be covered and we would have to pay for a new windshield at full cost. The woman was not very friendly in her handling of this issue. HMMMM! Forget that! \\n\\nState Farm informed me that any reputable glass company would stand behind their work and offer to fix the problem. State Farm then provided us another provider to correct the ding in the windshield. (My wife will write a review on this).\\n\\nI would suggest that you go somewhere else when getting a new windshield, repaired etc. \\n\\nI can only warn others to steer clear of this business and the woman who runs this place.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nMy girlfriend and I went there this past Sunday for the second time.  We went previously for my birthday and had a great experience.  The food is always great and very hot when it comes out.  I love steak so it is always right up my alley.  This past Sunday's experience fell short.  Our waitress, although nice, was not attentive and did not listen to what we had to say.  We ordered an appetizer and needed it prepared in a certain way, but it did not come out as we ordered.  We saw our waitress all of three times the entire night.  My girlfriend ordered a bottle of wine which was on the \\\"last call\\\" list.  We waited 20 minutes before she came to tell us that the bottle was not available.  The busboy that was associated with our waitress might as well have been our server.  He was great.  He made sure everything was to our liking and even refreshed my girlfriends wine glass.  \\n\\nWhen the food did arrive, we were satisfied with it.  The two times that we have been, the food is always exceptional.  But, you can't help but notice the lack of service.  I have to say it did affect our time there on Sunday, but won't hold us back from coming back.  We can only hope that the service will be better the next time.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Taken my daughter to this office a few times, but won't anymore. The good points- the office is clean. The staff that answers the phone is nice and usually helpful.  The hygienists are all really nice and are kid friendly.  On the downside- when you walk into this place it just feels cold.  The staff won't even greet you since you have to sign in at a computer.  Dr. Ash wasn't as kid-friendly and a little bullish with my daughter.  I understand she was crying, but she didn't do anything to make her feel more comfortable.  They seem to be all about money; they are very aggressive about making future appointments and overcharging when they can.  I would not recommend anyone to this place.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Have been there many times over the years and always thought it was decent food and a cool place. Went with my daughter for dinner recently and it was the WORST Mexican food I have had for ages, No chips were serve or offered. My chimichanga tortilla had the consistency of wallboard. My daughter's chile relleno was all coating and no filling, I can't remember now what else she had, but it was equally awful.  Her beans tasted old and sour. The pasta dish they serve instead of rice was bland and really not improved by the stale frozen peas. I also paid $2 for less than a spoonful of guacamole on my chimi.\\nI had a reasonably ok impression of the place before--cool environment, if a little run down, nice location and outside amenities, fair Arizona/Americanized Mex food. Nothing spectacular. Wow. what a let down. It may have been a bad night, but when EVERYTHING is TERRIBLE, I'm not moved to shrug it off and try again. The beer was fine, but for $40, I would rather go to one of the -Bertos's drive throughs. I'd get MUCH better food and a lot f it.\\nMay you have better luck, but in the area, you are better off with El Bravo or even Ajo Als.   \\nBased on my last meal, I would give this place NO stars if possible. My rating for this place is",

        "Review: I agree with Brian L. that their service was VERY SLOW and not at all what I am used to from this chain. They did not bring all of the food out at the same time either. The table next to us got three servers to bring all of their food out at the same time.  We got one who was clueless about what we ordered and if it was split up for the kids or if the order was wrong so we had to wait for a long second trip back to get the rest of the food. It was right after all.\\n\\nThe taste of the food did not meet my expectations.  A steak cooked to medium should be only pink in the middle, not red.  Food should be served hot, not cold.  As with any chain or franchise you expect the same level of consistency in service and food quality and when its not met then I feel it is the owner that does not care enough to hire good managers or monitor them.  When this happens, the brand name suffers overall so now I have to be wary of any Applebee's other than the one I usually go to on Ina Rd in Tucson which does serve good food and serves it pretty fast.\\n\\nYou would think Applebee's would be savvy enough to monitor social media reviews and investigate issues but its been three months since Brian L wrote his review so I guess the suits are \\\"out to lunch\\\" over at CrackerBarrel.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Never consistent. \\n\\nI was in twice this week. On my first visit I ordered a potato, chicken nuggets and a kids size frosty. I paid at the first window and when I reached the second they tried to collect money from me, when I informed her I already paid at the first window she asked if I was sure that I already paid. I wasn't OK with her implying I was lying about paying for my lunch. After all that confusion they handed me my lunch, told me to have a nice day and I drove away. One I got about 10 feet ahead I realized they never handed me my frosty but at this point it was too late. A car was already at the window and since it's lunch time the parking lot was a disaster and I wasn't going back. \\n\\nMy second visit was yesterday, I ordered a kids meal but it didn't have a toy inside. While this isn't a huge deal to me since it was for myself. But, if I had a kid in the back seat waiting on a toy, I'd be pretty upset. \\n\\nIn previous visits I'm usually missing an item 2 out of 5 times.

        "I do not get upset with places often, but Walker Furniture gave me the worst customer experience I've had thus far. When my boyfriend and I moved into our new apartment in September, I went shopping around for new furniture. As soon as I walked into the place, this creepy salesman asked me if I needed help. I simply told him \\\"no, thank you\\\" because I was going directly to the customer service desk to apply for credit. When I got in line at the customer service desk, I turned around and saw the same creepy salesman a few feet away staring at me like a shark, as many other reviewers have stated. As I was in line, he came up to me and AGAIN asked me if I needed help. This time I wasn't as polite and I think he got the picture because I didn't see him again. I was literally creeped out and felt like I was being stalked. The \\\"line\\\" at the customer service desk wasn't much of a line at all, I just stood there waiting for one of the girls behind the desk to call me over. Though there were about 5 or 6 girls there and only one of them was helping a customer, they all ignored and didn't acknowledge my presence. I finally just walked up to one of them who didn't look busy and asked if she could help me apply for credit. She then rudely handed me a paper application and directed me to the desk top to fill it out; as if I was dumb and I should already know this. Finally I found some furniture I wanted to purchase. I found a nice salesman who wasn't overly pushy and told him what I would like to purchase. With the model numbers ready, he and I walked to the customer service desk. Again we stood there waiting. None of the girls acknowledged that either of us were standing there, so finally he just walked up to one as well. A few days later, I called the store customer service to inquire about how to make my payments (because I financed). The girl was extremely rude and asked me \\\"payments for what?\\\" I was extremely confused by her response and asked her how to pay for my financed furniture...she then asked me who it...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Stopped into this branch on Thursday, Feb 17th. I drive past it all the time on the way to work and have long thought it would be convenient to do business at this location. The hours on the door indicated they were open until 5:30 and I arrived right at 5pm. The branch was empty with the exception of a few employees. I was greeted by one of the tellers. I explained my desire to apply for a loan and was directed to a young man named Anthony. \\n\\nAnthony could barely muster a friendly attitude. He was visibly annoyed to have to deal with me so close to branch closing hours. Immediately realizing his frustration I apologized for coming in so late and explained that I (like most people) have to work until at least 5pm but was able to get away a few minutes early to take care of some business.\\n\\nOne benefit to his eagerness to be done with me is that he flew through the process. I was literally done by 5:18. At which point his attitude improved significantly. \\n\\nThe very next day I received a follow-up call from the Sunwest Federal Credit Union loan team. They needed some additional information which I was happy to provide. I'm not sure what it is about the folks at this Credit Union but again I got a huge amount of attitude. It was clear she felt bothered to have to deal with me. \\n\\nUltimately I decided to take my business elsewhere. There are just too many other banks and credit unions that would appreciate my time and business. I'd recommend that you make a similar decision if good friendly customer service is important to you and your preferred banking experience. My rating for this place is",

Like literally the top half of my head was cut super short, no room to even blend. I've always said to friends for years\\\"You can't mess up long hair! I've never had a bad haircut!\\\".

        "A very unique dining experience in Phoenix and in fact anywhere in the US since Kai serves upscale Native American cuisine.  The dining room was nice, but nothing spectacular.  The service was quite good and I enjoyed how they explained the stories behind the artwork on the menus (65 different scenes, by the way).  The food was quite tasty, but somewhat overpriced, in my opinion.  Again, unique experience, but not sure we would ever go back based on price.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nThe lady I talked to was nice and they were able to save my girlfriend's boots.\\n\\nI've never had shoes fixed/repaired, so I can't really say if the cost was fair. But, it was $65 to add sole back to the bottom of her boots. Figured they cost $200+ brand new, why not?\\n\\nHere are my gripes:\\n\\n1. Told two weeks, took 3 and I had to call them to find out. When I did, I got the excuse answer of, \\\"he's finishing them up\\\". They called me 3 days later to say they were finished. Just be honest, I said no rush anyway.\\n\\n2. They don't take cards. I can understand this 20 years ago, but it's not hard or difficult, and it's located in a sketchy, broke down neighborhood with no ATMs to be found. Who carries cash nowadays?\\n\\n3. When I went to pick them up, they were in the back and not up front, with trees in the boots, ready for presentation. Just lying on some table in the back. \\n\\n4. The boots originally had a \\\"wooden\\\" looking sole (no idea how to really describe it). But the color contrasted the black boot. What they replaced it with was a black rubber heal and a wooden (I guess) \\\"half sole\\\" (what she described it to be), which was then painted black.\\n\\nNeedless to say, the \\\"style\\\" of the boot has been changed and it does not look better. Also, the glue or whatever they used to attach this stuff with, was just painted over. The finishing on it is amateur. \\n\\nIt's like they didn't even care to try to impress us. Sure, the boots don't have cracked soles anymore, but they now look like some thrift store garbage find that was repaired by some DIY hack. I mean, I would have done it myself if this was the result I could expect.\\n\\n\\nNice old \\\"mom and pop\\\" shop, and what the service / shop environment they provide is a dying breed. I'd love to say something nicer, and surely there are plenty of happy customers. Why these boots came out worse, who knows.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I love sweets, so for me that's a good way to start a meal. My Caesar salad was okay, very heavy on the dressing and the lettuce wasn't super crisp. I ordered the oven roasted chicken and the meat was delicious. Very moist and nicely seasoned. \\n\\nI was surprised how busy it was considering we went pretty early on a week night. The service wasn't stellar, but not bad either. Overall, it made for a satisfying week night meal, but not a place I'd choose for a special night out.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I've been eating at Saba's for about 10 years and it is always a delight! They have a ton of choices, the food is incredibly flavorful, and the prices are very fair. This place is really a hidden gem - tucked in the corner of the strip mall on the corner, it doesn't seem like it would be a great dine in location, but it is! They recently redecorated (or maybe it was within the last year), but they have really created a beautiful atmosphere. The service was kind and attentive. \\n\\nI went with my parents, and both ordered salads. The \\\"regular\\\" is plenty large. My dad opted for the \\\"large\\\" and found himself with way more than he could eat (which is saying a lot for my dad!). I made my own two-item platter with falafel & baba ganoush. The falafel were very galick-y, which I love, and I got about 9 falafel! It was a ton of food, and I ended up eating it for days. We also got a hummus appetizer, and that was a great way to start the meal.\\n\\nI'm glad this place is doing well, it really is a neighborhood joint. It seems like the owner & staff knew most of the customers coming in, whether for dine-in or pick-up. Give this place a try, and you will fall in love! Also, they have a check-in offer of 10% off!

        "I dig this place.  I have only ever eaten here for lunch, but I have been here a kabillion times, and I love it.  The only 2 negatives are the parking and the SEMI-cash-only situation.  Meaning, this place DOES take credit cards if your order is over $25!\\n\\nA lot of other Yelpers have complained that the male owner is a little rude, and his wife (I think?) is the other owner, and she has always been okay.  I guess I am from the east coast, so they seem totally fine to me, but I can see where AZ people think they're a little gruff.  Whatever... I am not paying them to be nice-- I am paying them to cook me some awesome grub.\\n\\nThe best sandwich, to me, is the Italiano because it's the best prosciutto I have ever had.  The texture and quality makes it melt in your mouth.  Also, you can have this sandwich on focaccia (my friends usually choose this option) or the homemade Italian bread, which is my choice.  It's soft and that dusting of flour just makes me all Italo-happy.  It's served with uber-fresh basil as well.  There is a balsamic dressing that is usally served on top, but I ask for it on the side, as I don't like my bread to get mushy.  Finally, the sandwich is pretty big, so it's worth the $10.  (It's gotta be $10 worth of primo prosciutto alone!)\\n\\nThe other key choice is the pizza.  I departed from my beloved Italiano one day (but only because I had already eaten it 2 days before) and ventured toward the pizza.  I am suprised to say that it's really great!  The crust is perfect, and it's just the right amount of doughy.\\n\\nMy advice is to try it.  Get there at 11:30am or 1:00pm for lunch.  Carpool.  Bring cash.  Smell the air when you walk in.  Order the pizza.  Make plans to go back and try the Italiano.  ;)\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

There is plenty of parking since it's in a shopping center, which is a plus in my book.  I was surprised to see some filipino dishes on the menu but too bad we didn't get any.  This time we ordered the breakfast plate - 1 spam because I love spam and gotta have my spam and the other one was Portuguese sausage.  I'm not too big on the portuguese sausage so I thought it was alright.  But the spam plate was yummy.  It also reminded me of the mickey d's food in hawaii so that brought back some memories.

I saw our very friendly waitress approach her manager who was clearly annoyed by the question  (we made eye contact more than once). The waitress came back and said she was really sorry but they can't do anything about the wait because everyone else is waiting too. So we canceled our order, and they made us pay for the tea we drank!\\nNow I know it wasn't much but when I've had a problem like this at other restaurants, the manager always comes over to the table and hears the grievance personally.

I felt I owed the apology to myself, because SOMETHING was owed to me to take the place of a good time that I had hoped to have here.\\n\\nTwo things blew it for me.  And these are not two petty things.  \\n1.  The guns and vests.\\n2.  The arcade machines.\\n\\nThe guns suck.  Downright blow chunks.  There is a 'heat sensor' on the bottom of the gun that requires you to hold your sweaty hand over it in order to fire.  I've used guns that you've had to hold with 2 hands, and I don't like it.  Its difficult to snipe people below an elevated opening.  Just try it, you'll see what I mean.  \\nThat isn't my main gripe about the gun, though.  When you shoot, you hear nothing.  There is no red laser beam.  Just a dot off in the distance.  Okay, okay, okay.  I'm being anal.  But this is just sub-par with any of the laser tag places I've been.  Its not like I'm an aficionado on laser tag guns, but this one just felt cheap and generic and unfun.  I'm used to guns with your friggin NAME on the back of it, telling you when you've tagged someone, where you tagged them, the name of the person you tagged, and what your current rank in the game is.  Now that's TOP tier laser tag.  Even bottom tier made some type of zapping noise and gave you an actual beam you could see. \\nThe vests didn't even vibrate when you got tagged.  No sound letting you know you're out.  You have to look down to see if you're flashing red to even know if you're hit (and if your team color is already red...then you're just screwed).  All you get is a number for identification.  No cool codenames.  But I will say this...the targets on the vest are actually accurate.  You won't be shooting a shoulder target 20 times to get a hit. \\n\\nNothing P's me off more than broken arcade games.  Stratum's has a so-so selection.  Tekken 5 is the highlight.  But...the joystick balls have been stolen.  The Player 1 slot doesn't work.  Garbage.\\nThey have a nice...\n\nStars:",

The organ music and atmosphere are unique and enjoyable, and I love coming now for those reasons...but the food....not so great. The pizza isn't anything special, not much better than a $5 frozen pizza, and the salad bar is lacking.

I've been going to Seattle Espresso for over ten years now and it's by far one of my favorite places to grab a drink.  My favorite is their Bella Mocha.  SE uses a bitter sweet chocolate sauce made by a Seattle company called Dilettante Chocolates. They also use cream (sorry health nuts - not your drink) that gives it a bit of a silky buttery taste mixed in with the bittersweet chocolate.  I would class it a Bittersweet Nirvana!  Starbucks's new Cocoa Cappuccino does not even compare to it and all it does is make me crave the Bella Mocha even more.  Another plus with SE is that they use an Italian Roast Coffee bean for it's espresso drinks.  Strong and full of flavor, and again this may not be your cup of Starbucks.   So if you like Italian roasted espresso and full flavored concoctions, give it a try!\n\nStars:",

The servers are not very experienced and have a lot to learn about customer service.\\n\\nThere must be a new sushi maker because the California roll we ordered looked awful. It tasted okay, but there was something off about the presentation. The couple sitting behind us also had a problem with the California roll. We both ordered the Tokyo Chicken Slaw and it took forever to get to our table. The chefs must still be learning how to make all of the dishes.\\n\\nWe like going to Eastwind because of the location and the food.

I ordered the carne asada meal, and I have to say that the service was quick and the food was inexpensive. The meal I got, though, was a disappointment. The beef was very dry and tasteless and the rice was dried out, although the refried beans and the soft corn tortillas were OK. Overall, the meal was unsatisfying and I left quite a bit of the meal unfinished.

        "What more could I say about this place in leu of all other reviews? Well for one, I can say is this: For the price, the large quantity, taste and quality and great customer service gives this place a 5 star and no less.  A must try for the newbies out their is the meatjun, fantastic! They recently added a Chinese Menu which, unfortunately, makes it much more difficult to decide what to eat.  If you aren't sure what you're appetite is feeling like, the server an owners spend more than enough time to explain everything on the menu. \\n\\nSeating is sometimes limited due to locals who eat here on a daily basis but do not fear, expansion is near! The owners informed me that they will be expanding the restaurant this year to maximize seating occupancy! If you do find yourself waiting for a table however, the servers treat you with their famous boiled peanuts as an appetizer for the wait. They are also very attentive to their customers and always work quick to keep their customers satisfied.\\n\\nLast tip. If you see the owners son (cute boy with the nose piercing) say hello! He is the most friendliest server ever! And tell him Sam Kim sent you HAHA!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Hello, 1980s!  Stepping into Shun Lee Palace is like stepping back in time.  The colors of Mauve and Hunter Green abound in the decor.  And lets not forget the swivel chairs.  \\n\\nWe went on a Saturday night and were seated immediately.  Like someone else mentioned in their review, it was mostly an \\\"older\\\" crowd.  (Perhaps they've been there since the 80s?)   It took quite some time before we were greeted by our server and quite a time longer before she returned to take our orders.  \\n\\nI like to think that I know my way around a Chinese restaurant, but there were dishes on the menu with which I was not familiar.  And, unfortunately, there were no descriptions.  Tai Chi?  Tung Ann?  New Tze?  Flower Chicken?  Royal Chicken?  Peacock Chicken?  I asked our server about two of them, but didn't want to ask any further and went with Sa Cha Chicken because I knew I had had it someplace once before.\\n\\nThe food came out as it was made.  First, two (of five) dinners were brought out, one of which had to be taken back because it was wrong.  Then that second one returned with the correct entree.  Then a third dinner came out.  And then finally, the fourth and fifth together.  The food was enjoyable, but a bit on the bland side.  If my entree has a little mark next to it because it's spicy, I want it spicy.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  And there was nothing on the table to doctor it up.  Everything tasted very fresh, though, so kudos for that.  And the kids' entrees were pretty big, so they were a good value.  \\n\\nI'm wary of Chinese restaurants that don't automatically offer you chopsticks.   I like chopsticks.  I like to eat Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and sushi dinners with chopsticks.  It adds to the experience.  Since we rarely saw our server, I didn't even bother to ask for a pair.  Maybe there was a shortage in the 1980s?  \\n\\nI'm sure some people have been going to Shun Lee Palace since they decorated in the 1980s and love it.  I, for one, have experienced much better.  Much, MUCH better.  Atmosphere is a big deal... My rating for this place is",

Usually, they have pretty solid food, and have a great beer selection. Went there with my work-mates in celebration of a major milestone, and our big boss picked up the tab (which is always nice)!\\n\\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers, lots of beer, and then the entrees. Mine was the last to come out, and when it did, I said, \\\"where's the beef?\\\" And I literally meant it. My braised short ribs were ALL BONES! Yes, all bones, with VERY LITTLE meat on them! And what little meat there was, was chewy. As a \\\"foodie,\\\" I am shocked that their Chef would actually serve something like that. I mean, did he think I was an Irish Wolfhound who would gnaw on the bones???\\n\\nI had to come home to eat something as I was still hungry (not having any meat for this meat-a-tarian is brutal)! I sent their Management a message, but have not yet heard back. I seriously doubt I will hear anything from them, but I felt compelled to tell them that this meal was just AWFUL! Thank GOD for the good beers to drown out my disgust.\\n\\nDespite my anger at this, RiRa still has the BEST Fish and Chips in Charlotte, and again, a wonderful beer selection.

Thinking back, it was kind of a dump then, and it is a dump now.  There are two dinning rooms, and an old carpet that looks like it is older than me.  They have those old Chianti bottles (the cheep kind) hanging from the ceiling.  Cheesy looking maps of Italy hung everywhere and mounted in the glass of the tables.  This place has not been updated since the 70's, and it shows.  Still surprisingly welcoming after all these years.\\n\\nThe service is fast and friendly.  Though, considering not many people come here, I think they are just happy when a party walks in.  Food comes out quick as well.\\n\\nThe food is that over stuffed cheese and sweet marinara sauce faux Italian that is found all over the country.  Manicotti is bland, except for the overly sweet sauce.  For an app we had fried ravioli.  Which was OK.  The pizza, again OK.  An overly garlicy crust.  Canned sardines, the pasta is probably not freshly made.  An average wine list, crap beer list.\\n\\nSaying all that, this place still has a special place in my heart.

        "Review text:\nWe mistakenly chose to host an 65th wedding anniversary family celebration at Vincent's.   At the end of the meal, as we were trying to collect our uneaten desserts, Vincent became enraged by the delay to his waiters' ability to clear the table.  (We later surmised that the threat of overtime pay prompted this entirely inappropriate, frightening response.)  The alternative and civil approach would have been to help the guests while simultaneously clearing.  \\nThe honorees, ages 87 and 88, had been loyal and frequent customers for over 30 years.  They were deeply shaken and frightened by Vincent's threatening loss of self control (which escalated to threats and his grabbing of my 87 year old mother's arm).  No member of my family will ever step foot near this establishment again.   Unfortunately, Vincent's inappropriate behavior trumped any value associated with food.\n\nStars:",

        "Professionalism. That is what makes you remember a company; that is what brings you back. In this case, that is what drove me away. I initially went in because of an issue regarding pulsing when I was braking. Having been there before for an oil change, I decided to go back again. Pulling into the parking lot I was greeted by Jesus who led me into the lobby. That was the only positive experience I had. From there I presented a coupon for a brake service that was 50% which dropped the price to $89.99.  As I sit, Jesus (the manager in white) gets a call, in which he begins to swear, describing how it is ridiculous that he has to send an employee to another location.  After some awkwardness, I am led into the garage where I am shown the various issues with my car, bad cabin filter etc.  but unlike the brakes, (which were worn) the outstanding issue was struts and wheel cylinders which they said were shot and leaking, respectively;  a safety issue. I go back into the lobby to work out the details and price. The new total to fix struts, brakes and wheel cylinders $2400. I was stunned, I tell him I don't have that much money. He says don't worry I can set you up with a credit card and payments. I decline and from there I start trying to figure what I can delay since I don't have the funds. He pushes hard for the wheel cylinders and at one point, as I am going through the list of issues I ask \\\"What would you say is most important?\\\" His response, \\\"What's your definition of important? I think crash, burn and die.\\\" And again he pushes for the wheel cylinders. At that point I make a phone call outside and try to discuss funds but my wife is a stern \\\"no.\\\" There are just no funds for something like that, likewise I tell him the same. At that point, we are getting nowhere, no negotiation on price period. So I decide to have them put the car back together and head out, before they do they make me sign the invoice next to a statement where he puts \\\"needs a tow truck, because he believed it was that bad.\\\" For 20...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Our server was very helpful in explaining the menu items and even went out of her way to ask if the kitchen could make an item that was no longer on the menu (hummus with kobe beef, served with lettuce cups).

That was a little disappointing to hear. What else is \\\"premixed\\\" here? But we ordered the pizza anyways and picked off the green peppers. As as far as gluten free pizzas go, it was alright.

But we got a nice meal, she got an egg white omelet and I opted for their Gyros since this IS afterall another place run by Greeks. While tasty, the Gyros were NOT the \\\"shaved off the rotating spicket\\\" variety....pretty sure this was frozen Kronos meat. Not bad but certainly not as good as the freshly shaved kind either which you could get down the street at the Mad Greek Cafe (just not at 3am).

Well, if you can and you're interested in these kind of words, go to Houston's for only the BEST ever, hands down, without a doubt, yummiest french dip sandwich you've ever had in your life (be forewarned, they put mayo on the bread, so if you're not into mayo on your french dip, like me, then ask for no mayo),but Ooooooooooooooo... YUM!! And if you like killer chili (they only serve chili on Saturday's), you won't be sorry you ordered theirs -- it's amazing. Or how about a kick-butt burger, eh? Simply delish! And don't even get me started on their artichoke dip -- there isn't enough word space on Yelp for me to go there! Trust. \\n\\nThis is by far one of my favorite restaurants, unfortunately I live in Portland (where they've never even heard of a Houston's -- poor people!) and I only get to visit the Scottsdale location every once in awhile when I hide myself away in my husband's suitcase whenever he goes there on business. :( \\n\\nGREAT french dip!

        "Trendy ambiance, fresh sushi, but the worst hibachi I've ever had.\\n\\nFirst with my sushi review: I have been here multiple times for sushi and liked the bar set up and thought the sushi tasted fresh and the service was quick. Good for happy hours (especially Thursday specials) or dates. However I don't like how if you only want to order sushi you have to sit at the bar. It makes it impossible to go there as a group or you end up waiting forever if there aren't enough seats in the bar area.. when the entire back room could be open. \\n\\nThe reason for my 2-star review is the hibachi, something that is pretty standardized among restaurants, but Nakama didn't have any of it right the time I went. The miso soup tasted like the packet cup of soup you buy in college. I ordered the shrimp and it turned out tough and rubbery. I also tried some of my friend's steak, which was also well done and dry. The hibachi chef didn't even ask how she wanted it to be cooked. Also, even though it's similarly priced to other hibachi restaurants, you have to up charge for fried rice and don't even have the option of noodles.\\n\\nBottomline: go to Nakama in small groups for sushi but stay away from the Hibachi\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: LGO is definitely my go-to place for breakfast, lunch, and brunch. Oh who am I kidding...dinner and dessert as well! My favorite thing to do is to come in on a Sunday morning after the hectic activities of the weekend, and enjoy a delicious breakfast in their trendy atmosphere. Of course, everyone talks about their commuter sandwich, but my absolute favorite is the tuna salad on 9-grain. I always come into LGO intending to try something new, but I can never stray away from that sandwich. The thin apple slices paired with the perfect consistency of tuna salad, placed between two pieces of crispy toast, is like heaven in my mouth. Their freshly squeezed orange juice is also a great boost on the weekend mornings!\\n\\nI love LGO so much that now they've opened a location in the Sky Harbor Airport, I ALWAYS make a point to go to that terminal (even if my flight does not depart or arrive there), JUST so I can get my fill of LGO. Recently I tried their sea salt chocolate chip cookie, and is smitten. It is an incredibly rich cookie, but I love the chunky texture of it and how it looks so fresh and homemade. Plus the shaved sea salt perfectly balances out the sweetness of the dark chocolate! It is a humongous cookie though...and it is very filling.\\n\\nLGO also has a display of the cutest and quirkiest items on sale in the front. It's a great way to kill time while waiting for your order, as the lines as always very long on the weekends. It's a fun place to grab some unique gifts for your friends!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "This company has been \\\"handling\\\" our home in Las Vegas for two years now. It is an AWFUL company to deal with. The staff is extremely rude and unprofessional. They do not ask you before they order work to be done. They tell you after. They do not reply to emails or messages in a timely manner. They ignore you and are completely incompetent. We have had THREE \\\"managers/agents\\\" in the past 2 years. Do yourself a favor, spend a little extra and GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "A bit of a run down, yet still clean, hotel. Front desk service was friendly. Room was on the small size. I requested two beds but was told they were out. Our room came with a sleeper sofa so that was fine for the kids. The entry smelled of chlorine from the nearby pool, and the floor was very wet from patrons who apparently didn't feel the need to dry off before going to their rooms. It would have been nice if the staff had mopped it up. Breakfast was good, with several hot options (waffles, eggs, sausage and potatoes). It was very crowded and the poor man running the breakfast could have used some help, but he was very quick to address and needs. The wifi was strong and easy to connect to. Lots of shops and restaurants nearby.  Overall, it was just a so-so hotel. It could use some updating for sure.  Not worth the 2.5 stars Priceline gave it, but it was safe and clean and had a good breakfast.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "My favorite date spot in champaign. They have a fantastic beer menu and a seasonal, chef-inspired menu. Their burgers are the best in town (in my opinion). And I am yet to have something here I didn't like. Staff is very knowledgeable, at tentative, friendly, and helpful. \\n\\nOne of Crane Alley's best features is its diversity of atmosphere. You can sit at the bar and enjoy, shoot some pool with your friends, or you can have a more private table in the back 2 stories of the restaurant that are quite and comfortable for having a nice meal. Then during the warmer months, you can sit outside on the sidewalk or in their quaint, creatively-decorated alley that is right next to the building (hence the name Crane Alley). The ambiance out there is top notch and I would highly recommend it any time the weather is nice! My rating for this place is",

The restaurant is quite small and there aren't very many tables so you will most likely be very close to another party...but that's apart of what gives Ichiza it's authentic feel.

        "I've been to Cajun Queen a couple times, once for a work meeting and once on a date with my boyfriend. The meeting was definitely the better experience solely in terms of food, everything was spot on and delicious - I especially loved the crawfish scampi! For my entree I went with tilapia which tasted very good. \\n\\nThe last time we went service was slow (it was a weekday), and the food surprisingly forgettable. We split the calamari appetizer which was pretty standard and each had the steak Diane. I am a rare girl but found the meat a bit tough- usually filet should be easy to cut through, this wasn't the case. \\n\\nI'd say stick to your seafood options, give yourself some extra time to dine, and enjoy!

        "***This review is for the bar counter service only***\\n\\nThis is a really hard review for me to write....why?  Because I love this place, but last night the service was so bad I have to give it 2 Stars.\\n\\nThe Better Half and I enjoy going out to places that offer flights of wine.  We enjoy sampling different vineyards without the cost of paying for a full glass of wine.  Grape Street is our go to place for this.  Normally we dine at a table and enjoy a full meal with our flights.  However, last night we decided to go to the bar because we didn't plan to eat.  It was a mistake.\\n\\nThe bartender's service was horrible.  We had to get our own menus.  We each ordered a flight of the Zinfandels and glasses of water.  Once she poured the flights of wine, she didn't bother to tell us anything about the wine.  Normally, they will tell you which glass contains which wine and will give you a brief description of the taste & flavors.  She was more concerned with this guy who was sitting at the bar.  Keep in mind that there was only 5 people at the bar including my Wife & I when we arrived.  Within 20 minutes, there was only 3 of us remaining at the bar.....she spent all of her time chatting up the other customer.  Meanwhile, our glasses of water sat empty.\\n\\nI finished my flight before the Better Half finished hers.....that's always the case.  I was interested in having another glass and was considering one of the Cabs....however, she was nowhere to be found.  The bar was left unattended and who knows where she went.  Finally, she appeared with food for the other customer.  I waited until she delivered his order, then I flagged her down....she says \\\"Just one second\\\".....then she bolts from the bar.....what the ??  I watched her as she walked around the restaurant and she came back empty handed.....what was so freaking important that you couldn't take a drink order from a customer at the bar?  \\n\\nWhen she finally came over, I asked if I could sample one of the Cabs before I made my decision......she said \\\"sure\\\"...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nQuality food at a slightly higher price in a low lit restaurant with good charm.  \\n\\nThe vibe here is relaxing.  It's the type of place that feels quiet while you're there, yet you feel like you can speak in a normal voice without the booth next to yours being disturbed.  \\n\\nI've had the Kobe burger, crab cakes and the chicken salad sandwich.  The Kobe burger sells for only 10.99 or so, and is well worth the price.  Kobe beef makes for a pretty fantastic fancy-urger.  \\nThe crab cakes were pretty good.  Not too dry, but the seasoning and sauces overpowered the meat.  But it's tough to do shellfish right so far from their harvest point, and at the price they sell it at Red Rock.  So the additives probably did a good job to mask a mediocre flavor.\\nThe chicken salad sandwich was a chicken salad sandwich.  I probably wouldn't get that again for the 8.99 I paid.  \\n\\nTheir beer selection isn't fantastic.  But they do have some good staples.  Yuengling, Guiness, Blue Moon and a light lager of some type fill their taps.  Pretty standard.  \\n\\nI'd probably not eat here if it weren't so close to my home.  But as it is, I've partaken a couple times and felt both times that the food and atmosphere was worth the price.\n\nReview rating:",

        "We moved here from LA temporarily until we could buy our dream house. We didn't see the apartment or its sorroundings before we moved in; I was dealing with one of the assistants and she sent me some pictures. I call other apartment complexes and none of them offered short term leases such as 6 months, so we had no choice but to move here.\\nIf you walk around; you'll notice A LOT of dog poop. Maintenance guys try to do their job; however, it's just impossible to keep up. These people are nasty! I have a dog and when I walked her around (with my 8 month son on his carrier attached to my chest) I would still pick up after my dog so I don't understand why others can't do the same.\\nThe manager at that time (don't remember her name) was super helpful and nice. They changed all staff since we moved out.\\nWhen we got to the apartment the carpet was filthy even when it was still humid when we moved in. One of the kitchen burners and the microwave didn't work properly.  The maintenance guy came because I put pressure since we just moved in and deserve working appliances. They agreed and sent a guy the next day. The maintenance guy said he could not fix it and needed to order a new one. I asked to get another one from an empty apartment and get it installed and the next person could wait for the microwave. They agreed too. Even when they were busy fixing other apartments; I would always get someone in 3 days maximum which was not bad if it wasn't an emergency.\\nThe security deposit was only 100$ (which is not bad even with my dog). We never got it back.\\nParking is bad! We only had a carport for one car far away from our apartment and my husband had to get a spot anywhere else. \\nWe were there for almost 5 months and the manager was nice enough to work with us in moving out. We gave out two month notice but since we were having difficulties and didn't know exactly when we were moving out; she kept the date open. \\nFortunately, we didn't have that bad of an experience here.

In January I dropped of my clothing to get cleaned a few weeks later I picked them up and placed them in my closet.  Yesterday I was organizing my closet and noticed my expensive Arizona Cardinals sweatshirt was missing.  I emailed Mark's Cleaners about the missing shirt where he said it was at the store.  Once I arrived at the cleaners the owner (Brion) said he took my sweatshirt home I asked him why did he take it home? He said he did not think I was coming back for it.  I had to call Scottsdale police department to get my clothing back. Once the officers got to the store Brion turned over the sweatshirt.  The officers said he came up with some lame excuse why he didn't turn it over.  Brion wore my sweatshirt, it is dirt, smells of his cheap cologne, and it is faded.  I asked for payment for my destroyed shirt and the owner (Brion) refused.  Anyone thinking of using Mark's Cleaners DO NOT USE THEM!

        "UPDATE!!: \\nAfter the experience I had today, especially since it was an incident with a manager, I don't really want to go back. \\nI had ordered a pair of jeans in a longer length and put them on layaway. I paid the minimum percentage of the balance in case I didn't like them, and received a call when they came in.\\nLet me add that I normally LOVE the service I receive from this location, but today I was shocked.\\nA new employee was helping me out and he was super friendly. He needed some help doing somethings which was understandable and I just waited patiently. Everyone starts off from the beginning at times. Well long story short, I got the same jeans in a different length and they had to return my initial payment to me, then I needed to purchase the new jeans. Well when I was looking at the receipt when I got to my car and looked in detail at it, it didn't show the $12 off the payment, and it Just didn't make sense.\\nWhen I called back and tried to talk to them to understand why the receipt didn't make sense, the manager, Mark I think, was not nice about it. He wasn't helpful with explaining the situation, then insinuated that I had thought that the new employee helping me stole from me, which I NEVER said, nor do I think he had. He mentioned that he also looked at the security camera to check. I was just trying to understand the receipt that wasn't clear.....\\nBecause of this interaction, I don't know if I want to go back. I sincerely hope that the head person of this location look at this person!! My husband also said he had an unpleasant interaction with him while trying to get a military discount.....\\nI will go in there when I know that Jenna is there, and only when I know she is there.\\n\\nFIRST REVIEW:\\nThe first time I went into buckle, I was already thinking I wouldn't find anything. I've had a few body issues, that apparently only I see, and it's been hard to find clothes that fit me right. \\nWell Jenna greeted us when we first went and she was understanding from the beginning.

        "This place has to be one of the worst places I have ever eaten at. It makes me angry that it has the positive reviews it has. I merely ate here because of the good reviews. I love wings and I'm always looking for new places to try. When I walked in, I was not impressed, it was very cluttered but I kept an open mind..I wasn't there for the view..I was there for the food. When I received my dozen wings,they came out on a Styrofoam 5-part throw away plate. The entire bottom was covered in oil and grease. The wings were fried past the point of being able to salvage any meat off of them. I couldn't even taste the sauce.. All I could taste was grease. I could only stomach eating 4 out of the 12. I ate two wings and two legs hoping i had a few bad ones... But I could clearly see by looking at them the whole order was uneatable. I thought about complaining, but it just wasn't worth my time or energy. I was completely shocked this'd place was busy and has the reviews it has. If you don't care how your food tastes, then I say this is the place for you, it's affordable and the staff is nice. But if your like me and have some standard to your food order... stay away from here, don't even waste your time or $7.00. It's a dump in more ways then one. I didn't even want to give it a star. My rating for this place is",

        "We live 1/2 mile away, hadn't been there in a couple years, but close to the movies, so thought we'd give it another shot. OK for my wife, not good for me. It's a meat lovers festival, and while I'll get some chicken once in a while, I'm more vegetarian when out, like Saturday night.\\n\\nThey don't have a vegetarian section at all on the menu, and when asked, the server said the could \\\"substitute a soy burger for any of our other burgers\\\". \\\"We only get a request once in a while and tell tell them we have a soy thing.\\\" Really? What a poor answer for someone who really wanted a true veg offering. 3 of the 5 burgers had bacon on them, and the other 2 just aren't what you'd serve on a veg burger. This guy didn't even know what kind of a burger it was, and didn't even go ask. Boca? Black Bean?  No clue.  He just laughed about everything.  I ordered it anyways as a veg patty with cheddar, lettuce and tomato. What a joke.\\n\\nThe burger was dry with hard edges, served with 2 small end cuts of tomato that didn't even cover the patty, a piece of lettuce, one ring of onion (which I didn't ask for nor want), one small piece of dill pickle, which I also didn't ask for. The fries were OK, but I could taste that either they were deep fry in beef grease, or they had fried some kind of meat in it, since the fries has a meat undertone. I was very disappointed.  Off flavor.\\n\\nWhen a server can't even tell you what kind of burger it was, and didn't go ask, I took it as an insult that vegetarians aren't respected very much, and this give didn't care. He joked in his Jacksonville, Florida, southern accent like he'd good 'ol boy his way through the meal. Sorry dude, laughing and joking just shows why you don't take your job seriously. I was close to speaking to their manager about their menu.\\n\\nThis guy was all over us before ordering and while eating, but when it was clear we were almost done and weren't ordering dessert, he was hard to get back. He was in it for the orders. Took almost 10 minutes just to get the bill. Once...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nBest red chili in town. Others have beat me to it, and it's no wonder. Norteno has been serving simple Tex-Mex with local flair since 1981. It's not much to look at, for sure. After driving by for so many years, I finally gave it a whirl and ordered take-out for five to sample its many specialties.\\n\\nWhat overwhelms is that it is home made, right there in that little building. You have to wonder how they do it, but damn! Sorry, Sylvia's. You've been de-throned.\\n\\nMy tastes included the red chili beef chimichanga, then smothered with more of the delicious rich red sauce. Even fried, the flour tortilla was somehow still moist and the minced beef melted like butter in my mouth. I added rice and beans like any gringo should. Yeah, the cheese on the beans was not melted by the time I got home, but how could it be? And unfortunately the stock used in the rice was not fresh, possibly cubed or powdered because its taste was explosive in some bites, absent in others. Rice was overcooked, but it was freshly made, not served for days and days after the batch was made like other places... nice.\\n\\nThe salsa was not the usual \\\"picktwosyllables\\\"-berto's watery vinegar, but its ground chili was brilliant. Makes a great addition to any dish: douse heavily for best results.\\n\\nNorteno makes their own chorizo, and it does not disappoint. Difficult to get excited about toenails, snouts, lips and assholes, but it's Mexican Spam, and it's home made!\\n\\nThe only puzzle for me is that after almost 30 years they haven't got their act together for a proper dining area or a better location. Diners must take orders to go, or sit in the lean-to at tables and seating from Kyoto Bowl under bad florescent lighting. I think the owner's going over to My Florist to have a look at the space. A bit much glass for me, but it's close to her original location anyway.\n\nStars:",

I was recommended this salon by a friend and went just once to a stylist and she completely butchered my bangs and cut off hair that wasn't even supposed to be incorporated into bangs. I have really long hair so she cut off hair that was still supposed to be long and ruined my shape and everything. She cut too far back and too far to the sides. I have to regrow the front parts of my hair which will take forever. I am so upset and do NOT recommend this place. I won't be totally cruel and share the name of the stylist but I learned she hadn't been there that long afterwards so please find out how much experience and years someone has before you let them touch your hair. I'm incredibly upset and she messed them up right before the holidays and before I had to have pictures taken.

I wasn't encouraged to just get whatever, even though it would have brought in money. I was cautioned against a lip or eyebrow ring for professional purposes and given really good information about what I wanted done. When I finally did get pierced, I got the procedure done for free because it was my birthday and I went into a very clean room, with Ana, who is absolutely fabulous. She did a great job of putting me at ease, and I barely felt a thing. Halo is just such a great place if you want a good piercing.

This makes shopping difficult because I have to go to 2 different stores if I need cat stuff. Luckily she eats a lot less, so her food lasts so much longer. \\nI also like to get my horse stuff here.

BLECH!!!\\n\\nI also ordered ton katsu curry...soo i got this because someone was raving about it. like the wasabi the curry lacked in the spice category, a lot. Not only that but the pork cutlet was so dried out...\\n\\nand the panko also no spice at all and what in the world, had no flavor at all. it was like eating deepfried mush. \\n\\nmy over all rating.....2 because the staff was nice and friendly, otherwise i recommend going somewhere else for sushi/japanese food.. their spicy _\\\"enter random fish name here\\\"___ rolls all taste the same...super fail....and they weren't...yeah you guessed they weren't spicy at all My rating for this place is",

He ordered a turkey sub on wheat with slaw and extra Russian. \\nThe kids behind the counter couldn't have been much older then 17 and reminded me of every single person in my graduating class. Helpful and pleasant enough to not get fired. When they were done making my sandwich I swear it was the biggest \\\"medium\\\" sub I had ever seen. \\nWhen I took my first bite it was to die for!

The location that I usually go to in Scottsdale was booked, so I made a reservation for the Phoenix location. I arrived a few minutes before my reservation and the hostess let me know that the table wouldn't quite be available at 7:30, which was fine because my date was running super late. She offered me a seat at the bar but I just hung out and was seated not too long after arriving. \\n\\nThe decor of the place is different from the Scottsdale local. A bit more Southwestern and warm in my opinion. I was seated at the booth for about 10 minutes, still waiting for my date, but our server Cory came by and got my drink order and dropped off the menus. Once my date arrived, we decided to get the Big Night Out cheese fondue, which was REALLY good. We skipped over the other courses and got the Big Night Out chocolate fondue, which was dark and milk chocolate, peanut butter, and berries. It was really good. \\n\\nTMP is definitely a special-occasion place in my opinion, unless I'm taking advantage of one of their special offers they have every once in awhile. And it makes an impressive dessert date\n\nReview rating:",

Lastly, the horrible over powering smell of weed that filtered into our room was uncomfortable at 1am and staff couldn't do anything to fix the issue.

There are plenty of tvs throughout, along with a couple in need of replacement on the outside patio. The inside viewing is pretty easy from anywhere in the bar, but finding a seat can prove to be difficult. \\n\\nThe bar area lines one side of the place so there are plenty of spaces to work your way up to the bar to order. The beer selection on tap is extensive & they have a very good selection of higher end beers (Red Oak, Blue Moon, etc.) \\n\\nI've really only experienced the nightlife here, so I can't really critique the food other than saying the finger food I've snacked on is pretty tasty. The chicken quesadillas were good, but I'm anything probably would have tasted great at the time.

The wait wasn't bad and they accommodated for a party of 9 which was also nice because most small restaurants would just seat you at different tables. We did not think the food lived up to the hype...at all. Lemonade...not freshly squeezed, even though the server said everything is made in house and fresh. Cornbread and Soul Roll...best part of the meal. Anything fried....TOO GREASY. I got fried catfish and my plate was covered in grease and whenever my fork went into the fish, more grease would spill out...EW! One food runner, female, came to our table with the wrong food. After no one claimed the wrong food she says, \\\"Do yall even know what you ordered?!\\\".....ummm CLEARLY you just have the wrong food. Let's just say everyone has something bad to say about their entree meal. Someone in the kitchen needs to change the oil, drain the food with a napkin (simple) and avoid getting grease on the entire plate. The yams tasted like they were drenched in maple syrup...and that's it....not good at all. My moms cooks better soul food.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Dear ASU Tempe printmaking majors (or those interested in making transparencies for printmaking),\\n\\nTransparencies are cheap and are printed in decent high quality, 300 dpi looks great, although nothing larger than an 11x17\\\" (you can still piece them together). Their transparencies print with a white paper strip stuck to the top of the sheet, but you can easily peel it off, but if you are piecing it together, rotate your image accordingly so that it does not get cut off. Also, the canvas size for the 11x17\\\" is always going to be a little less than what it actually is, so I suggest resizing to 10.5x16.5\\\" just to make sure you're getting everything you want. The large format toner printer is also pretty sweet in 300 dpi, for those of you that like the old school way of making the frosted mylar false transparency. I don't know the largest size you can get with the toner printer, but you can cover a gigantic screen if you wanted to do some really large screen printing. Relatively fast, cheap for those of you on a budget, it's still a corporate OfficeMax, but what can you do? Those of you taking photopolymer plates with Dan Mayer, remember to double up on your transparencies to block out as much light as possible.\\n\\nPS - always specify the dpi to the employees, otherwise you might not get the greatest results, and bring multiple formats in your thumb drive just incase your .gif/.png/.psd/.pdf/.tiff is incompatible with their ancient relic machines that they like to call computers.\\n\\nSincerly,\\nFellow printmaker Darryl N My rating for this place is",

I found the food watery, overcooked (even by Indian food standards) and tasteless. There seemed to be no care in preparation of the dishes, so that the vegetables weren't cut into the same sizes, each dish tasted much like the other, and the food didn't even look attractive. I don't mind divey surroundings, but I abhor a smelly old carpet, and they have wall to wall carpeting that was around before most of us were. They offer mango lassi which they keep in the original gallon plastic jug that they bought it in...at least pretend that you made it. There are 2 better Indian restaurants a stones throw from this place...Namaste and Mintt, both across the street.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The Pub certainly has the dive feel to it - red vinyl booths have a few tears and are quite rump-sprung.

The burger itself was delicious, cooked properly, juicy and nice accompaniments....Except for the fries.  The menu said \\\"Seasoned Steak Fries\\\", but they weren't even salted.  And you know you have to salt the fries when they are fresh out of the fryer or it won't stick.\\nThe burger bun was nice and fresh, but didn't hold up and by the two-thirds point started falling apart.\\nI would be happy to have the wings again, but the dining room was quite smoky.

I have never had a wait staff say \\\"thank you\\\" and \\\"you're welcome\\\" more than this. They even joked with me as I ended up waiting 30 minutes for my delayed guest. (I used this time to read other Yelp reviews for my meal selection.) I can only hope that service is like this at all times. For my money it doesn't get any better here.\\n\\nFood: C\\nUnfortunately the food wasn't as good as the service. I got the chicken parmesan after reading that the salads were less than overwhelming. I guess it would be OK if you like your chicken parm buried in veggies and cheese. Me? I like my chicken parmesan to be mostly, you know, chicken. It wasn't bad, mind you, but I can make a better dish at home and I am certainly not an Italian restaurant. Can't say I recommend the meal I had here this day. (on the other hand, I did once have the lasagna here and I remember it being tasty).\\n\\nQuite frankly, for me the Olive Garden is a better Italian experience, even with all of its chain restaurant failings. I can forgive bad service if the food is great (the tip is an interesting invention) but not the other way around.

It =is= a dive bar.  I mean that in the best sense.  Cheap drinks, a friendly crowd (many of whom seem to be regulars; they know each other).\\n\\nThis review-o-matic only offers me a choice of 1 or 2 for ratings.

Although Tofu Hut isn't the cheapest place around Vegas, I think it's most worth the price if you take into account the variety and quality. I always get the pork belly and marinated sliced pork belly (a must-have wherever I go) and share everything else. I love the oh-so healthy idea of dipping already-oily meat into oil and salt. I also love that they have good beef tongue and tripe, which I have recently taken a liking to. The bean paste soup and egg are pretty good as well.\\n\\nAnd the best part of AYCE at Tofu Hut? DAT SALAD.\\n\\nBy the way, this is solely a review for the kbbq. I came here for tofu soup (soon dubu) one time and it was meh. That was before I discovered they had AYCE.

Well, we've never had a problem at this Sam's Club ever...until this past weekend.  Granted it was busy.  People were waiting in line.  I got out of the bottleneck and told my mom to follow with the cart.  I head towards the east end of the checkout lanes and find a lane and stand in it..waving my mom over.  No sooner than I wave my mom over, this guy in the next lane completely looks past me and pushes his cart in front of me.  I tell him \\\"Sir, I'm standing right here in line.\\\"  He says..No I've been here the whole time.  To which i state, No you've been lane hopping and I've been watching you for the last minute.  You were in the lane over.  He proceeds to get in my face cursing at me in Spanish.  I back down...because a lot of not nice things were going to start flying from my mouth..(which would have ended in me probably punching the guy in the face)...and I state...alright sir..you were standing here the whole time..Though everyone around here knows you're lying.  That's fine.  My mom walks over after the guy starts cursing at me and states...\\\"You do not speak to my daughter that way!\\\"  He then starts cursing her out in Spanish and says..I'll see you outside.  UHH..WTF!?  \\n\\nThe whole time this exchange was going on...No one from Sam's Club - a manager, floor sup, NO ONE comes over to intervene.  My mom sees a worker, who looks to be a manager or front end sup..and says...why are you just standing there witnessing this happen?!  He says...well he's a customer.  WELL EXCUSE THE FRACK OUT OF US!  I THOUGHT WE WERE FRACKING CUSTOMERS TOO!?  \\n\\nMy mom dials up the police and they're there in no time.  We weren't about to mess around with someone stating they'll \\\"See us outside\\\".  Police get there and the dude bails.  \\n\\nI can only hope that a Sam's Club will open on my side of town.

        "Located in 5th Avenue Place downtown, Cafe Amante definitely serves its purpose for a sit down eatery as it's the only true sit down restaurant in the building. It's nothing special, it's just there. The good is good the service is okay as well. It's just kind of there. Nothing is every special or changing there. I hate calling it regular but that's truly what it is.\\n\\nIf you're going for lunch look to spend about 10 bucks per meal and that's not including your beverage. It could be considered pricey depending on your lunchtime budget. I'm a fan of their chicken parmigiana. They also have a nice chopped salad. Plus free Breadworks rolls make everything better, right?\\n\\nI don't see it changing its ways anytime soon as the business travel through the place keeps it pretty steady. Why change what's no broken is probably what they're thinking, however, I really thinking the outdated decorations could really go. But if the boss man is paying, why am I complaining?\nSo I would like to give it",

        "My husband and I went here on a Saturday night at about 9:30pm. It was not very busy but it was so loud, it was ridiculous. There were two \\\"bands\\\" playing. One band had a tuba player and it was so loud that it sounded like there was an elephant in the room. I ordered a Diet Coke to start and I wouldn't have mind paying $2.50 for it, except for it came in a can. I think $2.50 for a can of Diet Coke (so no free refills) is way too expensive. In fact, almost everything on the menu was very expensive (most entrees are between $17 and $25), considering that the restaurant itself is very informal (almost like a diner), I thought that the prices were way too high. Between the high prices and the loud tuba, we didn't even stay long enough to order food. \\nUnless you like very loud tuba music and like paying very high prices for seafood (given the atmosphere), I wouldn't go here.\nSo I would like to give it",

It all looks cheap, like they have changed the ingrediants.\\nBecause, it certainly tastes like they have.\\nThey have glass glasses now,which I do like better than the plastic.\\nThe Pasta looks aweful, we could not even try it. It just looked bad.\\n\\nThe salad was good, but they have taken away things like the chickpeas and the kidney beans. In its place they have a 3 bean salad type thing.\\n\\nThey did still have sunflower seeds and raisins  which  is good,as well as the Joan's Brocili dish.\\n\\nBut, even the soup seems differant. The lemon Orzo tasted like fake flavors and hardly any chicken. The Chili was a little better with more meat. But, I have to say I was in no way impressed.\\nThey do not even have real Butter anymore. It is margarine and flavored Butter, I just want the real thing.  What they were presenting as Ice Cream was not, More like an Ice Milk that had an artificial taste to eat.\\nNo one ever came to clear a single dish away from our table.

Should be a good place for trying various offerings, but might be harder to find a go-to regular dish.

It was really bad! But the manager came up to me and apologized and asked me to please try again- on them. OK, fair enough.\\n\\nSo the week following, I placed a smaller lunch order for my crew.

        "The food quality was pretty authentic and price point reasonable; however, there was no \\\"Joyfulness\\\" in their service.  There was no greeting upon our entry.  What was uttered represented a grunt at best.  And like with too many Chinese restaurants, do not expect the server to return to check after serving your dishes.  The only person who communicated and provided some positive attention was the non-Asian bus boy, or maybe he was a waiter-in-training.  \\n\\nIt was a quiet night so several waiters stood a few feet from our table surveying the empty tables.  Guess they had nothing else to do; they stared at times and never said a word or cracked a smile.  \\n\\nThey should remove the \\\"Joyful\\\" name from their business and replace with \\\"Me-No-Smile Chinese Restaurant.\\\"  If hungry for Chinese food in Las Vegas, give them a try; just do not expect a \\\"Joyful\\\" atmosphere, because that's false advertising!  Will I go back again if in LV?  Maybe.......food was tasty.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "I stopped by Flemings for a Saturday night dinner with a couple of friends. I had reservations, so even though it was busy, we were actually seated 15 prior to my reservation time. The atmosphere was as I expected, although I was a little surprised that some people dressed more casually than I would have expected. \\n\\nThe service was excellent. The waiter took our drink order and brought a loaf of bread that came with two spreads - both were excellent! One friend and I ordered the petite filet mignon, which was served with Fleming's potatoes. My other friend ordered the regular sized filet mignon with a baked potato. I have never seen a larger potato. My two friends each had a salad - one Caesar and house salad. The salads were each around $9, but good size. The regular filet mignon was $32, while the petite with the potatoes was $26. I didn't really think the regular size was that much larger than the petite. \\n\\nThe steak was phenomenal! I ordered it medium and I can't recall a better steak that I have ever had. It was cooked well, excellent flavor and the perfect size.  The server continued to fill our drinks, brought a second loaf of bread and made sure we had everything we needed.\\n\\nThe total of 3 diet drinks, 2 salads, a baked potato, 1 regular filet mignon and 2 petite filet mignons with the included Fleming potato was $135. Not bad for 3 people. I will definitely come back again.\nSo I would like to give it",

Look, I love food, and rarely complain, but I feel I have to be honest. Like one guy said, they don't really need our kudos now, as they are there and will remain there. Just like Primanti's and Isaly's,,,,oh wait, haha. The food was passable but could be better. the Oysters were good, and if ever I do go back I will get just them because the crab cakes sucked. Sure, I am spoiled by the east coast cakes I have had in Jersey and Baltimore. And that is the only thumbs up Ballymore will ever get from me!OOH, trendy hotspot you should take visitors to, fill them with cold Irons and fried sea fare, then take them home and they can say they have been there.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "My meal at Macayo's was decent.  I tried the Mex and Match with a shredded beef taco and carnitas enchilada.  It came with beans and rice.  The shredded beef taco was good but nothing to write home about.  A taco of the same quality can be found at any local Mexican joint.  Just throw a rock and you'll find a taco just as good.  The carnitas enchilada was not to my taste.  Macayo's must have a house marinade or seasoning and I didn't care for it.  Not horrible but I would refrain from ordering their carnitas selections in the future.\\n\\nStaff was friendly and my drinks were refilled without any effort from myself and the atmosphere is good.\\n\\nIt is not, however, a \\\"must go\\\" for Mexican.  You'll find food of the same or better quality elsewhere and for less cost as well.

They also give a head shampoo to die for.  I liked the way my hair cut and highlights turned out and was pleased with the overall experience. But if you go there, be prepared to have your hair literally ripped out.  The hair stylists and their assistants did not bother being gentle.  They ripped tangles apart with their fingers and pulled a brush though my wet hair so roughly it felt like torture. They used a total of 4 hair brushes on my head and by the end they were all FULL of my hair.  And my scalp has been sore for hours after getting my hair done there.  I probably would never go back, which is too bad because other than the brutal hair brushing I really liked the salon and staff.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nMy friends and I went to the Wrigley Mansion for a luch and tour special yesterday.   We ordered our food and the first course was really good.  It was a spinach & bleu cheese salad.   The second course was Croque Madame.   It looked wonderful, but on my first taste I almost hurled!  I am not a picky eater at all, but the ham was completely rancid.  I spit it into my napkin and my 4 friends were shocked because I never send food back and I'm the opposite of  a drama queen.  That's why they were so shocked.  The waiter asked if I wanted anything else and I politely declined.   I'd lost my appetite, of course.  My friends fish was almost raw, too.    So we decided to take the tour and have coffee & dessert afterwards.  The mansion was beautiful and the guide, Ashley,  was fabulous.  I was sad to see every single room was set up as a dining room.  There were no beds or dressers anywhere.  But the art, (They have a Renoir) , the chandeliers, the view and the grounds were stunning.  We went back to eat our creme brulee's and our old watered down ice teas, waters and crumbs were still sitting there.  The waiter didn't freshen up anything while we were on the hour tour.  And there were only 2 other tables of 2 there!    So we got our desserts and coffee.   It was good so far.   Then I asked for a coffee refill and I put in my cream & sugar and took a sip and the coffee was cold!!  I was so surprised that it was so cold that I spit it in my creme brulee' cup.  Again, I'm not a drama queen.  This was just so bad.  We told the waiter the coffee was cold & he was so surprised.  DUH!  He was nice but so inept.   We'll never go back, especially to eat!   I was the worst dining experience  that I've had.   They should at least give everybody a pack of Juicy Fruit for the road.  Anyway, it was such a disappointment, and I've wanted to go there since high school.\n\nReview rating:",

        "I just hung up with Rosati's pizza after calling to let them know of our poor experience.  My boyfriend went there with our two kids to pick up the pizza.  He waited 10 minutes watching our pizza sit there while they served about 10 other customers picking up their pizza.  By the time we got it it was cold.  The kids were hungry so he brought it home and we ate it.  Cold pizza is better than no pizza and hungry kids.  I called Rosati's; while on hold I listened to their \\\"Satisfaction guaranteed\\\" message.  Finally talked to a woman who claimed she was a manager.  I asked for a refund because my pizza was cold.  She insisted my pizza was not cold, and refused to give me a refund because we already ate some of the pizza.  So I'm supposed to turn around with my hungry kids and bring the pizza back and wait 45 minutes for another one?  Please.  Clearly they are disorganized about their service because they couldn't even find our pizza for 10 min while it was sitting right there getting cold.

I think they have new owners or managers, and that may not be a good thing. They used to be generous with toppings and sauces (not overly generous, but in line with other Subways). Now they are VERY stingy... very little sauce, small amounts of all toppings, etc. Seriously, I think my \\\"sandwich artist\\\" was counting black olives.\\n\\n3. Stingy with the meat. I typically get the sweet onion chicken, and they now make darn sure when portioning the chicken they don't allow one small piece to stock out of the already small scoop. My last sub did not have more than 6 medium-small sized pieces of chicken.

The burger itself was a bit expensive, and for the price I paid it didn't fill me all the way. \\n\\nI had my meat done medium, but if I ever do get it again, I'd go for the medium-rare because it would probably be way juicier and tastier. They even let you go rare if you like all that lovely blood.\\n\\nI went with 2 of my girlfriends. One of them ordered the pizza, which tasted really delicious. It was different from the typical pizza because it tasted like lasagna! My other friend ordered the Italian sandwich. The taste was not as great as it sounded. It ran a little bland. \\n\\nFor dessert, my friend ordered the bread pudding. It was a bit drier than all of the other bread puddings I've tried at other restaurants. The cream on this was very delicious and covered in cinnamon and nutmeg. I'd really recommend this dessert.\\n\\nOverall, great place to go with friends to sit, chat, and catch up with life. The layout is very cute and warm. Also, if you get the chance, visit the restroom!! This is one of the cutest restroom layouts I've seen in a restaurant.

The spinach ravioli was too much cheese and cream, again not balanced. This place has all the elements of a good dining experience but the kitchen needs to up the game for my taste.\nSo I would like to give it",

It was also convenient that we chose to take up the couple's wedding block deal and just stayed here for the weekend too.\\n\\nService from the hotel overall was meh. Most times when I was carrying luggage in and out no one opened the front door, other guests we knew had to contend with broken toilets, malfunctioning sinks, and room changes. Maybe these mechanical issues will be resolved once they're done painting (and renovating?) part of the second floor, I'm not sure.

Just called in to order a cab and I wasn't sure where I was (I'm not familiar with the Pittsburgh area that well) so I told the operator to give me a moment so I could figure out what street I was on. Note** I had just gotten off of work not coming from a bar or a lounge and drunk out of my mind. The operator told me and I quote word for word \\\"I do not have time for you to figure out where you are you're taking too long\\\". \\n\\nI don't think I need to really write anymore for this review to tell you what I think. But if you ever decide to call for a Yellow Cab don't waste your money. They're never on time they take FOREVER...45 minutes for a cab is absolutely unheard of and I'm from DC where a cab takes anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes to arrive even on a Friday or Saturday night.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I came on my lunch break here to Nice Nails for a pedi & mani although I only got a pedi. The lady rushed through my pedi even though I was the only one there in the middle of the day so it wasn't like they were busy. She cut my big toe and I started bleeding. Instead of apologizing she accused me of having sensitive cuticles. I  was hesitant to put my foot back into the bowl afraid of catching an infection and she kept saying \\\"don't worry it's fine\\\" and stuck my foot in the bowl after she put some clear glue and started blowing on my cut which any licensed nail tech would know how unsanitary it is to blow on people especially an open womb! After i told her to please not to blow i caught her still doing it as she continued to rush through the rest of the pedi. When paying I asked for at least a discount she laughed as if I were joking she gave me attitude for a $5 discount...as if $5 is worth more than a return client.

        "The Bad:  This hotel is old.  The rooms have a 26\\\" tube TV.  The bathrooms are comparable to a Motel 6. They have two places to eat...Hooters...wings and burgers and the Onion something.  People smoke weed in the rooms which stinks up a whole floor. The fixtures etc all seemed to be replaced but with repair/apartment grade stuff.  Big dings in the drywall.  Old rugs that you don't dare walk on in bare feet, (sleep in your socks if you get up at night). Real, real basic accomodations.\\n\\nThe Good:  Really cheap rooms. Regular people in the bar and gaming area.  Easy to get in and out of out front, not a zoo.  Kind of a fun but controlled frat house atmosphere in the small casino area. Right across the street from the MGM if you want all the fluff and $25 crap tables and $25 black jack tables.  The in-room coffee maker was good.  made shaking off the morning cobwebs a little easier.  No place for breakfast that I could find.  All the staff was great and very friendly/helpful and the \\\"Hooter's Girls\\\" working the casino area were very easy on the eyes and nice.\\n\\nLike everything is this world, you kinda get what you pay for.  If you want a cheap place to crash or don't care about the fancy schmance casino, this place will work.  I took a chance and stayed here while in Vegas on business.  Probably won't go back unless I was on a bare bones budget, and even then I'll look around for something else.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nMexican food is funny because it's one cuisine that we tend to have so many favorites in that we need to make sub-categories. As such Comedor Guadalajara would be filed in my database as the Mexican seafood place that I won't eat all day in anticipation of over-eating at. This is a very thin category, in fact it's the only one. The Veracruz style snapper is single-handedly responsible for keeping me from moving to another city. The shrimp tacos certainly pitch in on this retention campaign as well. Let's go back to the snapper for a moment, shall we? This dish serves an ample portion of fresh snapper  in a near stew-like combination of jalapenos, onions, bay leaves and a rich tomato sauce. If that's not enough, you have the option to add shrimp. \\n\\nIf I'm not feeling like eating off the coast, the chicken mole is sure to get my vote. The mole here is so good that I get a little insulted when I see it on menus elsewhere. The chicken is pulled from the bone and seems stewed as it's very tender and juicy. \\n\\nService is always quick and friendly here. Decor is not the most inspiring here, but in Mexican restaurants I think that is a badge of honor. Folks of my pale pigment may pass on this place because it's location is rather industrial and low rent. That's fine by me, they can go to Macayo's and I'll take my usual booth under the spray painted swordfish.\n\nReview rating:",

Finally after another half an hour we asked the cashier what was going on and he told us the mechanic was test driving a car, when we could clearly see the mechanic outside so he was lieing! Then we told them we are not paying anything and leaving and they told us we need to wait because they don't know what they disconnected!!!!! Then we asked to see a manager and she kept walking past us and ignoring us!!! When she finally came to us she had the worst attitude ever and just gave us the keys with no sorry or anything!

        "Review text:\nI had such a pleasant experience at this store, that I had to review it.  \\n\\nI generally like Gap for cheap basics.  I don't care for their sportswear nor their fancier dresses--I don't think most of it is high enough quality to be appropriate for corporate or even business causal workplaces.  But for t-shirts, button-downs, shorts, jeans, leggings, and other such items for playtime or to wear at my more causal workplace, it's perfect.  I pretty much bought a new summer wardrobe for under $100 by going in on a days where most items were 40% and by using a TON of saved up rewards cards that I get monthly as a cardholder.  Plus Tuesdays offer an extra 10% off for cardholders.  Let's just say that I saved more than I spent.\\n\\nWhat stuck out to me was that the girl--I believe her name was Georgette--who rang me up went out of her way to make sure that I got the best deal possible with all of my promotions that I could use.  It took three times as long to ring up me, but she was very patient and friendly during the process.  I actually filled out the store survey when I got home because I was so pleased!\\n\\nBonus, you can now opt to save a tree and get emailed receipts.  This will also put you on the mailing list to let you know when the sales are so if you're thrifty like I am, you can save a ton.\n\nReview rating:",

        "We have continued to frequent this Outback since my last review, and until last night, the food and service were commendable - no complaints. Just the way Outback should be. But something must have changed, because last night - a Saturday night - when we arrived for dinner at 7, and were seated almost immediately, things immediately started to go wrong. We had no silverware or napkins until we asked for them - and that was after we had already finished our appetizer of coconut shrimp. I had a hard time getting the server's attention to request the napkins and silverware.\\n\\nThen the server forgot to bring bread until we asked for it, and she explained that they don't bring out bread now until after you've ordered. Almost ten minutes later, we still didn't have bread, so I asked her again. She brought the bread, and I cut into it right away, and it was cold to the touch. I have never in all my visits experienced cold bread at Outback. By the time I got her attention and she brought out another (warm) loaf, with apologies, our entrees had been served, and it was kind of too late.\\n\\nMy grilled salmon was one of the worst servings of salmon I've ever had at any restaurant - almost tough and chewy, rather than delicate and melt-in-your-mouth, as I've had it before at Outback. The baked potato was on the small side and not quite done - definitely not fluffy like they usually are. The manager never did come over to ask how things were. It was my birthday - my real birthday - and I had hoped for the same good experience we've had pretty regularly at this Outback, but now I wish we'd gone somewhere else.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: I went to Hambone's on the Saturday of the Lawrenceville Cookie Tour with a group of friends.  One of us had been there before and gave us a four-word review: \\\"Bad service.  Good food.\\\"  I'd say he was about three-quarters right.\\n\\nThe food was decent.  I got a burger (the one with blue cheese, I forget what their name for it was).  Fine but not spectacular; I wasn't particularly impressed.  The fries were good, as I would expect from a pub-y place like this.  To drink I ordered their hard lemonade and then a Black & Tan.  I enjoyed both and I thought the beer selection was quite good overall.\\n\\nBut the service was what really left an impression on us.  After we ordered to a surly waitress, she snapped the menus back with a frown like it was her job.  Remember that scene in Lord of the Rings where Ian Holm jumps at Frodo and his face gets all scary?  Yeah, it reminded me of that.  Then after getting our drinks we didn't see her for a good half hour, which considering her attitude I guess I wasn't opposed to until about half of us finished our glasses.  No check up, no \\\"anyone need another drink,\\\" nothing.  After that we got our food, ordered another round of drinks and didn't see her again until she cleared the table and brought the check.  She had earlier asked how we had wanted to get the check, which we first responded with all separate but after seeing the look on her face that that request had caused we quickly changed to \\\"whatever's easiest for you.\\\" \\n\\nI guess it's not a good sign when you ramble about the service at a place for twice as long as you talk about the food.  But that's just what Hambone's was for me.  The food was totally forgettable; the service was terrible.  I would've liked to go again and try something different, but I don't feel like playing \\\"try not to aggravate waitress\\\" again anytime soon.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Didn't complain, cause it was seasoned perfectly and their steaks are usually very tender.  \\n\\nOne downside - there we're a couple of screaming kids present for most of our meal.  No one from the restaurant said anything to the parents. I realize this can be an awkward situation for the restaurant management, but I think everyone deserves a pleasant dining experience (not just parents). \\n\\nIt 'seems' parents are often content to sit and let their kids scream at the top of their lungs.  ...sigh...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "If you are a beer connoisseur, you need to go here.  \\n\\nPersonally, I love this bar.  This place is 5 miles from my office and 5 miles from my house, no wonder I made it to 200 beers so easily!  \\n\\nThe Flying Saucer literally has approximately 300 unique beers, with at least 100 on tap, and some of them are rotating beers.  Additionally, they have daily specials, like pint night with $3 pints and biggie beers for the price of a pint and even beer poker.  Their loyalty program is also rad, drink 200 unique beers and get a $100 tab on the house to have a party with your friends (I'm 421).  Fear not non-beer drinkers, they also have liquor drinks.  \\n\\nTheir food menu is decent, I mean, it's bar food...The pretzels with queso dip are the best!  And the scenery, aka the waitresses, aren't bad to look at either...in their school girl uniforms.  They have pool tables in the back and good music streaming, unless a crappy band happens to be playing.  If a band is playing and there is a cover, Beer Knurd members get in for free.\\n\\nProst!\nSo I would like to give it",

You get handed your drink cups and a number to put on your table and try and find a seat.  Maybe a 15 to 20 minute wait for your pizza.  Your pizza comes out and...... \\\"what the hell is this?

The Pad Thai (beef), Pad See Ew (beef), Yellow Curry, and House fried rice were all excellent, all solid 7.5/10 easily.  Coming from LA where there are lots of Thai restaurants, this place is easily top 5 Thai restaurants I've experienced.  \\n\\nUnfortunately the prices are little expensive at $10 a plate.

        "Pleasant atmosphere, great coffee, hit or miss bakery\\n\\nWhen I venture to Middleton to catch up with friends over a cup of coffee, I often end up at the Prairie Cafe & Bakery.  It's a short bike ride from the 53597 and the Alterra Coffee (or is it Colectivo now, I'm so confused) they serve beats the pants off of what you can get from the neighboring Starbucks.  \\n\\nI wish the outdoors seating area took advantage of the nearby Pheasant Branch Conservancy.  Sipping coffee and watching the locals pick-up their dry-cleaning just isn't the vibe I'm looking for I guess.  \\n\\nI can't vouch for the breakfast or lunch selections, since I'm just a coffee and baked goods sort of guy.  As for baked goods, I've had some excellent scones and muffins at Prairie.  Like scream it from the rooftop great.  But not every time.  Just when I'm ready to proclaim Prairie my go to coffee and a scone hangout, I get a scone that's as dry as Atacama Desert.  And since I'm dropping some decent coin here, I want better consistency.\\n\\nThings I like:\\n * Love the staff here. Even when the place is getting slammed by waves of morning commuters looking for their sugar and caffeine fix, I always get a smile and courteous service.\\n *  Always love me some free wi--fi.  Never had a problem connecting or with download speeds.\\n * The noise level indoors always seems to be a soft murmur, with some relaxing music wafting in the background.  Never had a problem carrying on a conversation with my table mates.\\n * When the FDA approves Alterra Coffee for intravenous use, I'll be first in line.  There are always are four or five roasts to choose from and I've never had a skunky cup.\\n\\nThings I don't\\n *The \\\"cash only\\\" thing was so hip in the 18th century, but it's 2013 now.  Start taking plastic, people.\\n * The baked goods are not inexpensive.  It's usually worth it, but it's annoying as hell when I lose the muffin lottery.\\n\\nIt's a solid three star option with lots of upside if the bakery improves its consistency.

        "Komol is definitely on my weekly lunch rotation. I really enjoy the chicken Indian curry, pad Thai, and pad see ew. The herbal salad is also great! The employees are very nice, however service can be inconsistent. It seems that during dinner time it can take quite a while for your food to come out. Also, the spice level can be inconsistent as well. I opt for mild to medium in spice which can range from \\\"hey where's the spice?\\\" To \\\"OMG my lips are burning!\\\" So now I stick to saying mild to play it safe. \\nThis place has a great vegetarian menu as well and all of those dishes are delicious too. \\nDefinitely a restaurant that you should try. Also, get the Thai iced tea with coconut milk...amazing!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

That being said, I was a tad nervous when taking my dog there last summer. The staff was extremely friendly and understanding about my apprehension about leaving my dog and I thank them for that. When I was away, they emailed me a picture of my dog so I could see he was doing well (plus you can go online and see them on their webcam during play time) They also offer additional packages with more play time, ice cream doggie treats, bed time stories (don't laugh, thats just cute) and more. My dog was so happy when I went to pick up, I think he was even smiling! I think their prices are pretty reasonable for overnight stay compared to some other joints in the area and have taken him there a few times since.  \\n\\n Best Friends also offers your pets first night free which is pretty sweet seeing that I have nothing against saving $$$$ here and there and they provide you with a report card when you pick them up--again--cute!!

Spring rolls they were alright nothing special. Pork meatballs very tasty just two skewers and a garden load of veges and herbs. It was like I ordered a BBQ meatball salad. They serve it with rice paper wraps on the side that r hard( WTF ) maybe I missed something ? Give me some water so I can soften it up myself,  I also ordered the BBQ pork bowl or I thought I did. I got the same set up as the BBQ meatball , shit load of lettuce and herbs and some BBQ pork and what looked and tasted like 2 slider patties? The meats are very tasty but the meat portions r small. They serve alot of lettuce and herbs, I mean alot of it  \\n            The food taste good, it's jus that the meat to lettuce ratio has to change , if I were rabbit I would b happy.

They honestly care and show compassion to all members of your family including those that have fur and stand on four legs. Highly recommend them!\\n\\nIn depth review: Dr Snead is our main contact at the animal hospital. He is a kind and caring doctor. I have never felt rushed or like he is putting profit before the animal or our own well being. He is always on point and has made visiting this animal hospital much easier. Has often sent us home with meds at no cost and waived fees. The facility is clean and immaculate. \\n\\nAbout a year ago we had the horrible experience of having two older male cats both come down with two serious cases of cancer within months of each other. Was a difficult time. Dr Snead did EVERYTHING that he could do to try to save them. Including overnighting one of them for weeks at no cost while administering care. When it became apparent we had to let them go, he made it as comforting as possible. He remained with us and I knew that he was feeling our pain - could see it in his face. Honestly not sure if we would have been able to make it through the situation w/o him helping us or standing by our side. He was amazing!\\n\\nDr Snead has that \\\"it\\\" factor hat makes him a great doctor. The animals also seem to connect with him and the staff. Have seen them calm right down when he or his staff handle them. \\n\\nWe now have new furry creatures in our family and we still continue to bring them to Sunridge.

No, this a not a place you want to find yourself after 9pm.  Nor before 9pm.  I'd heard bad things from friends who fly through here frequently, but I was still disappointed.\\n\\nMy flight arrives at 9:15 or so, and I'm already unhappy because a poor corporate travel agent didn't tell me that \\\"direct\\\" flights are not always \\\"non-stop\\\" flights and that while I had only one plane to SFO, I had to get off it at least once during the return. So I arrive and deplane so they can move the Airbus to another gate (?), and since there's a 90 minute layover, I go in search of food and drink. \\n\\nFirst, I sense the skeeviness. It couldn't have smelled like stale cigarettes in the terminal (no smoking!), yet somehow I felt it did.  Maybe it was the beige decor, straight out of 1974, and the dingy looking carpet. The design was like the old sections of O'Hare or Dulles--all narrow halls, low ceilings, and backlit Helvetica signage with (perhaps) dead bugs stuck between the light bulbs and the plastic lenses.

At the crossroads between A's and B's, I see moving walkways heading in two directions, but there's no airport map.  Call home.  Get advice. Check the internet. Ponder the consequences.  Head toward the A's, since that's where my plane will end up in an hour.  Take one walkway.  Take another walkway. A new concourse appears over the horizon.  \\n\\n*Rumble* *Rumble* *Slam!* \\n\\nCrap.\\n\\nThere's some activity at the end of the concourse, and I see some kind of Tequila-themed bar. Seating!

        "Not great, but not terrible either.\\n\\nPros: My wife liked the salsa, but I say it's just okay. You get two different types, and the red salsa they give you just tastes like a mix of Hormel chili and ketchup.\\n\\n-Taco; Really liked the shell; it was like you get at a street vendor, seemingly just-cooked and folded. The chicken inside also tasted \\\"homey,\\\" like chicken you boiled for hours to make a soup till it was tender. Very brothy and nice.\\n\\n-Speed; our food was out in a matter of minutes. Kinda scary, actually, as one reviewer put it. Is everything frozen and reheated? Didn't seem that way, as I said my taco was pretty good. But who knows?\\n\\nCons: -Lack of spice; nothing on either of our plates had any spice. That said, I feel this place is definitely Mexican food for dumb Americans who can't handle it. Not that I'm looking to burn my mouth on every bite, but a hint of something here and there wouldn't hurt.\\n\\nMost everything else about this place is unimpressive, but passable. The decor is what you'd expect, service is decent, prices okay I guess. I'm not sure why other reviewers think this place looks dumpy, seemed clean and presentable to me. I'd say \\\"in a pinch, it'll do,\\\" but with so many other Mexican places around that's meaningless and Manuel's is just a face in the crowd.\\n\\nBottom-line: Go here if you want typical Mexican with a slightly better-than-average dining room atmosphere.

        "Review: Tried it, hated it. I opened my food to check it, and there was hardly any sauce on it. I asked for a little side cup of the teriyaki sauce and was told that it would be 27 cents. I said it will cost you more to run my card for the charge than you are charging me, and this meat is dry to begin with. The \\\"lady\\\" told me, well it's 27 cents. I said that's fine, I will just go to your competitor next time. She said, \\\"fine goodbye.\\\" I hoped that when I got home this would be delicious at least. It wasn't. The fish was gross, the chicken was dry, the shredded mystery meat was gamey. I would rather eat a nasty drive thru burger than this garbage again.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

She was nice, but there should have been someone at the hostess stand when we walked in. \\n\\nSo let's discuss these little booths that they have. The problem with a place that puts you in a small booth with curtains is that it gets stuffy. When the curtains open air flows in and if your server is say, a smoker, you will smell nothing but the smoke. This is what happened to my husband and I. I am very sensitive to smoke, so I think I noticed it more than him. The food was OK. The service was SLOW, it took us over 2 hours to have two cheese fondue courses and some chocolate.

I ended up skipping the buffett and settling for the Grand Cafe where I had omlets. My room made me think of what a half-way house must be like. Do not expect pillow-top mattresses or chocolates.

Never been given this at ANY sushi place I've been to. That right there grabbed my attention. We arrived right when they opened so they were still getting ready. For waiting 5 minutes they brought out edmame. You can see that they want to make their customers happy. \\nThey have quite the variety of rolls from baked to deep fried to regular rolls. If you're looking for something w/ some kick try the Kiss of Fire. The mountain blast is another good one to try. Most of the rolls do have some sauce that come on them.

Also, my diet coke tasted funny and lack carbonation. My nephew ordered a grilled cheese and I thought they would use the local Sancholi bread, but no. ;(.

        "I desperately want to give them 2 stars.  But it's quaint enough that I can't.  Burgers are decent but not memorable.  I wasn't crazy about the wings even though they offer several different kinds.  Mine were burnt.  Drinks are made well but the rickety seating gets uncomfortable pretty quickly.  And it's a little disappointing that they don't actually have a proper bar.  Yes they have a bar, but it's one short strip with six or eight stools and a server station practically in the middle.  \\n\\nThe whole place is basically a house converted into a restaurant and some of the nooks with table and chairs crammed into them in this joint are pretty uninspired.  However there are plenty of items to try on their large menu and prices are right.  \\n\\nIt's a nice little neighborhood bar that doesn't seem to have aspirations of greatness.  Which is kind of nice these days when everybody's trying to be the next big thing.  I just hate using the word nice to describe a bar and grill.  Do something to make me excited to drive over to you and want to recommend you to my friends.  What do I crave when I go to EBBG?  It ain't the service or the seating.  So basically nothing.\\n\\nBut I've been back a couple times.  Lunch and dinner are inexpensive and they have Famous Grouse, a palatable low-end Scotch.  But the sandwiches aren't so hot.  Stick to burgers and wings.  This place would definitely be more popular if the food was better.

Their happy hour has some good deals - $6 cocktails and glasses of wine, and $1 of bottled beer.  It was a fun, trendy atmosphere and a nice place to go for a glass of sangria after a busy day.\\n\\nI came back for dinner a month or so later.  We had reservations (on a Monday night) and were seated immediately -even though the restaurant was surprisingly busy.  We sat in the covered area out front - sort of like sitting in a dim, Mediterranean garden.  And yes - the lights are low throughout the whole restaurant.  Even with my young eyes, I still needed a candle to read the menu.  But it is romantic and a peaceful place to eat.  A little uncomfortable, as they have metal chairs (sort of like upscale patio furniture), but not a big deal.  Sit inside at a booth if you need to sit on something soft.\\n\\nThe menu is pricey and we're all poor, so we just got entrees.  I actually had a cocktail to start - the Perfect Pear - with elderflower liqueur, vodka, sage, pear, and vermouth.  There was even a little sage leaf floating in the glass.  It was a wonderful drink, with all the flavors I love.  Still, for the price, I think the portion was a little stingy.  When I buy an $11 cocktail, I like it to really fill the glass.  We nibbled on warm bread while we waited, and all tried their pesto on top - I think it was an unusual homemade pesto, something like walnut-watercress?  It was a bit bland - I think regular basil pesto would've been a better choice.\\n\\nThings got better during the actual dinner.  I ordered the Heritage Farms Chicken which was juicy and fresh, and served with a tangy pasta.  Each little detail of the dish was well-chosen - honestly, even the grilled baby squash was outstanding.  It's just squash!  But somehow, it was heavenly.  My friend enjoyed her Cioppino, and my boyfriend liked his veal tortellini, complete with rich pieces of lobster.  I tried a little bit, and it was tasty - very herbal...\n\nStars:",

Yesterday, elbow to elbow at the bar of The Armadillo Grill, among kindred Sportsmen in the Valley betting on the Sport of Kings (Horse racing), at the suggestion of the gorgeous Armadillion Carrie, I tried \\\"Richard's Pub Burger\\\" from the Specials Menu. Needless to say, the juicy beef, cheddar cheese and delicately fried egg sandwiched between a crisp, toasted Thomas' English Muffin, rivaled the best Pub Fare in the world. Try it with a cold beer or, as my friend Jimmy said, \\\"with a Bloody Mary! Breakfast of Champions!\\\" Now if I could only pick a winner at Turf Paradise! My rating for this place is",

        "Review: My husband took me to Otto's for my birthday on 1/26/11.  Our waiter seemed very haired, but we were not in a hurry with our meal, so we were content to wait longer than usual for our food.  The meal began well with the basil, prosciutto wrapped shrimp being wonderful, as well as the tomato soup.  Our main entrees (the filet mignon with the Parmesan french fries) was good.  The steak was acceptable, but the fries far out shadowed it--they were crisp and delightful!   All of this changed when we ordered our desserts.  I ordered my favorite--the Strawberry Napoleon and my husband ordered the pistachio cake.  He enjoyed his and I was just having a bite of mine, when I noticed the texture of the custard was off.  I took the layers apart to find out what was going on and the middle layer of \\\"fresh\\\" custard easily came off of the  philo dough because it was completely dried and rubbery on one side.  I flagged down the waiter and told him my concern.  His only response was--\\\"Well, no one else has complained\\\".  No apology was given, no option for a reduced cost on my desert.  Wow, is this what fine dining is all about?  Trying to hide the old scummy custard in the middle of the dessert in hopes that no one will notice because of laziness.  I wonder if the waiter would feed this dried old food to his mom??  This made a huge damper on the evening.  My husband paid the bill and we vowed that we will not be back for a long time.  There are many other restaurants that hold the food to a higher standard for the same amount of money.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "FINALLY, a place to satiate my ramen needs!  Potato croquette!  Curry katsu! There is hope for the Charlotte Asian dining scene! \\n\\nYes, the previous reviews are spot on-- authentic Japanese (minus the obligatory California roll and special sushi rolls) in a super charming space (Don't be thrown off by it's location next to the Little Caesars.) with friendly family-run service.)\\n\\nThis place is packed with fellow Asians (not the speed-racing kind like Ru San's) which is always a good sign.  \\n\\nTIP: Get the lunch special A or B.  You'll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant.  The special is $8 and is plenty of food.  (Last time, it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen. The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box.) \\n\\nTo the reviewers who had poor sushi experiences, claiming the rolls are similar to the pre-packaged ones at the supermarket, and un-fresh: I urge you to try Musashi again. I always find the rice perfect and room-temperature and seasoned well. Also: to those who complain the sushi menu is small, yes, it's less than a page.  However, who wants a phone-book-sized-menu if the food isn't good? \\n\\n(If you want to talk supermarket sushi, DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their own...and nobody knows!  In fact, it's pretty good, considering.) \\n\\nI also don't think the service is unfriendly at all!  Maybe being busy and task-oriented (not taking time to chit-chat) is mistaken for unfriendliness...I duno, I just call it efficient! \\n\\nTIP #2: You can't get their udon or ramen to-go.\\n\\nBottom Line:  If you're accustomed to some noodle houses in New York or LA, or in cities with large Asian communities, no, this place isn't going to be on the same level-- but sometimes you don't need all the frills.  Just a solid meal, run by a family you can tell knows what they're doing.\nSo I would like to give it",

She then told me it was the same price and said 'anything else you want'. Hah! I was not pleased. \\n\\nThe room was fine.

Even when I came in for a to-go order of chicken, they brought me out tea.  When it was almost empty they dropped down another glass. I noticed it's been cleaner the past year than the first few times I dropped in a few years back. I appreciate the little things and wanted to note on improvements. \\n\\nI liked the chicken porridge ($6.95) a lot and it was piping hot when I got home. They must've freshly boiled the chicken because it took a while and the chicken was soft and fresh tasting. I like that ginger is plentiful but thinly shaved into the porridge and that they put green onion, cilantro and shallot crisp. I think this will be a spot I'll come for it again. It's a perfect for when I'm not feeling well. \\n\\nI think this has slowly won me over as my favorite late night soup place.\n\nStars:",

        "I took my S2000 here for an alignment on a recommendation from a friend, and I'm so glad that I did! The gentlemen working the front desk was chipper and talkative. When I mentioned the car I was asking them to service, the tech that was in the office stretched his arms out and said, \\\"My friend, you've come to the right place.\\\" It turns out the tech is a fellow Honda/Acura enthusiast and sounded almost excited to help me out!\\n\\nHe drove the car onto the rack slowly, minding the lowered nature of the S2K. While he was doing his work we discussed all things Honda. He did not mind that I was in the shop, under the lift (inspecting the undercarriage), giving my car a once-over. Meanwhile, he's doing his job efficiently while giving me advice on how to modify it and get the most of a wonderful driving machine. \\n\\nPretty much, I'm happy as can be that I found a fellow enthusiast working right around the corner, who I know it out to do the best job he can on my vehicle. Definitely a reassuring feeling.\\n\\nWith all that being said, and as happy as I was with the service he, and the shop, had extended to me, the reason I am writing this review and rated it as such is because of the treatment I witnessed them giving other customers.\\n\\nWe've all had bad experiences with an auto shop at one time of another, and it seems like they can prey on women (who typically don't have the knowledge of cars your average Joe would). As I was in the waiting room, the gentleman at the counter, as well as another tech, were talking with a woman about her car, fully explaining the situation she was in, giving her numerous options to take care of her vehicle's problems. Although they weren't directing this honesty and service my way, I really appreciated seeing it and made a mental note.\\n\\nBased on how they treated me, and the other customers in their shop, I would recommend Tucker Tire highly!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Consistently the best \\\"purist\\\" BBQ in CLT. Meat is cooked over **real** wood in a pit I would be proud to have in my home (yes, I am a BBQ freak). Wife is instructed to have these guys cater my wake.\\n\\nMost/all the BBQ posers these days cook with gas or electricity. It ain't the same folks. Before you go into a BBQ restaurant, drive around back. Woodpile? If not, keep driving. Is the wood neatly stacked? If so, be suspicious because a fellow smoking meat at 4AM isn't typically neat with his pile. Does the restaurant only seem to smoke during dinner hours? We've got a chain joint near us which cooks electrically, but has a smoke-emitting stack- kinda like a smoke-sign. I refuse to set foot in the place on principal.\\n\\nHickory House does pork, beef, and chicken. The beef and chicken may be good (can't say), but this **is** North Carolina, folks. The only BBQ worth having in NC is pork. Never order french onion soup at a chinese place, I say. Go to Texas if you want beef.\\n\\nAs others have said, this place is a nondescript, brick, rectangle in an area of North Tryon which has seen better days. Ever heard of the Hidden Valley Kings? Lock your car and hide your valuables. Speaking from personal experience, here.\\n\\nThis is one of those buildings I wish could talk. The restaurant obviously started out as a road-house of sorts back when this part of the world was out in \\\"the woods\\\". I bet it has a ghost or two roaming around. Looks like the kind of place your parents' doctor/lawyer/accountant met his receptionist for \\\"overtime\\\" work back in the 60's.\\n\\nPersonally, I am partial to their chopped BBQ sammich, brunswick stew, and hush puppies. \\n\\nIf you're lucky/blessed/living right, your sammich will have some crunchy \\\"outside\\\" in it. You can get the sammich with or without slaw- your choice. I alternate.\\n\\nBrunswick stew is worth driving across town for (I do).\\n\\nThe hushpuppies are not health food, but they are addictive. We start out with an order as an appetizer. Don't know where they come from, but... My rating for this place is",

        "Yikes. After quite a nice meal here two years ago, I organized a brunch for my mommy group and the service was really pretty bad:/\\nWe had a reservation for a party of 8 and after being sat waited 45 minutes to order, then subsequently had to wait and wait and wait each time we asked for so much as a refill on water. Twice a porter came to refill waters and then walked off with several of the glasses still empty- never to return with more water! We asked for our checks in the middle of the meal because we could foresee it being a looooooong wait, and unfortunately we were right.\\nWhen the manager came over to ask how everything was, my friend mentioned that the service was really, really slow. He seemed surprised and eventually told us that it was because we needed separate checks. When we (nicely!) let him know that every aspect of the service had been slow, not just the check-getting portion, he mentioned the separate checks again and blamed our wait on an outdated computer system. When he came back 15 minutes later to find us still waiting he told us he had comped our bottomless mimosas due to the wait - which was nice of him! Only...none of us had had bottomless mimosas ($20), although 4 of the 8 had had single mimosas ($8). We all said thank goodness that we had ordered the singles, because I can't imagine how long we would have waited for a refill on the bottomless ones. \\nI do understand that separate checks are not ideal (when I organize a group outing elsewhere in the future I will definitely remind everyone about bringing cash) but they can't treat separate checks like some sort of puzzling phenomenon that has never been encountered before. And the separate check situation just doesn't excuse the long waits and poor service in every other regard.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Geee-ross!  The other half and I got take-out for this place.   But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?\\n\\nA few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.\\n\\nThe fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.  \\n\\nI'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  I even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with Chinese take-out, when I left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nI had ordered my daughters christmas present and had it shipped to this store for pick up. When we went there they brought out the $250 electric scooter and we noticed the bottom looked like it was off the box...it was. Once the girl brought it to us and left it on the cart for us to take off the whole thing came out the bottom. Then we looked at it and noticed it had already been out of the box. They walked away and left us to pick up the parts. We waited 20 min for someone to come help us and then she asked what we needed as we have a pile of parts and opened box on the floor. I then told her we needed a brand new scooter like I ordered and paid for...she told us to call other walmarts to find one. Really???  You gave us a scooter that had been opened and missing parts and want us to do your job? I then asked for a manager that didn't show up for another 50 minutes. She then proceeds to tell me they have no more scooters at her store or the others like this and will just refund my money unless we want to try to take that one home and see if it works. Hell no! I didn't pay that much for a missing parts, open, and broken scooter. She didn't even offer to have another one shipped to us which when I checked on line they still had available. Now I cannot find a black one for under $300 anywhere and had to go on Amazon and order a new scooter(not even the color she wanted) just so I could have my daughters gift on xmas day. Not the first horrible experience w/Walmart but this one tops it all. They ruined a 9 yr olds xmas gift,didn't care, and didn't want to help. Great job Walmart! Wish I could post the pics so you all could see what they tried to give us...you would be amazed!\n\nStars:",

        "Review: Nestled right beside the Hilton hotel and across from Panera bread is a quaint little Chinese & Japanese restaurant. I'd stray away from calling it fusion because the dishes look either strictly Chinese or Japanese. Chinese options include various sauteed dishes with fried meats. Japanese options include all your japanese food fare (so I'd venture to call this a Japanese restaurant that decided to serve Chinese food).  Dinner on a week night around 8pm was pretty empty so no wait for seating. I ordered the rainbow roll and spider roll. Everything was just A-OK.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I had a caramel nut latte. I will have it again. \\nThe baklava looked fantastic but was pretty much gross. This is the second time I have tried to eat it and it was exactly the same nasty stuff twice in a row. Even though it looks fantastic it tastes horrible. Avoid it at all costs. The service was sub-par. Our coffee person was a bit bi-polar. I'm not even kidding on this. One minute he was pleasant the next he was rude then back to pleasant, then rude.....it continued on like this for at least a few minutes. At first I thought he was just being sarcastic which I can appreciate, but then it turned into something else....not exactly sure what, but something not good. Anyway, he did make a mean coffee, so props to that!. Over all, yes I will go back, but I will not eat anything there this time. I have learned my lesson twice over now:)\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nMy friends & I all purchased Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. \\n\\nSo tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? \\n\\nIn addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. \\n\\nMy friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon and/or our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. \\n\\nThe Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "We've stayed at this hotel about twice a year for the last four years. It's a little hit or miss, so not sure if we will use them again in the Spring. \\n\\nLobby Bar\\nSarah was not handling the pressure of being busy very well. She was slamming her boss behind his back (\\\"I'll have him get you your salsa, he's not doing anything else\\\"), being short with customers (at 205pm, when lunch officially ends at 2pm, snarkily telling people they can no longer order off the lunch menu instead of offering to check with the kitchen on the availability of a specific item) and snapping at fellow employees running food or trying to help her. \\nWe went here three times over the week, and twice the bar was understaffed. \\nMargarita pizza was boring. Would consider making thinner crust pizzas. \\nMarket salad with salmon was excellent! Chopped salad should have chopped greens, per it's name, but also really tasty. \\nI like the wines with variable pour sizes. Cocktail prices are a little high for Phoenix. \\n\\nTop of the Rock\\nCatrina was the best server we had all week. Our food was good, but we were not ever whelmed as we should have been given the pricing. I suggest they revisit dessert options, as we tried two and neither one was good. \\nPlease explain that your ceviche is tomato based and not what people are typically used to...I was looking for traditional ceviche, and this was not it. \\n\\nBreakfast buffet\\nGreat selection of fresh food! Completely annoying that more money is charged for the exact same food during the week. Not fair to those of us without expense accounts. \\n\\nPool/Pool Bar\\nPeople were consistently walking around the pool area to see if people needed anything. Vanessa continues to be a great server at the bar. Half the pool was closed while we were there, which was a bummer. Also, stabbed my foot on a metal beer bottle top in one of the jacuzzis, so would be great if they could clean them more often. Please do something about the many people that sneak into the hotel to use the pool and jacuzzi. It seems...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I'll review mainly because they need a up to dated review!\\nThis place is kinda hard to find.  I passed it up once before I found out the exact location.  Once I walked in, I was very impressed with the store. Small mom and pop look and feel.  I liked it.  They seem to have a hardcore, and maybe even big business following in Las Vegas.\\nI came in with a broken dj mixer, said they will look at it free of charge, and let me know how much it will cost before they do any work.\\nThey did just that, however. I bought it in on a Friday, one week passes, nothing. Two weeks pass, and I decided to call.  Very nice staff, and were very nice to me when they told me, that my mixer has been in line to be looked at for two weeks.  This is also when they told me, there is a option to get your equipment looked at right away at an extra charge.  This is the main reason why I think they have connections with big business around Las Vegas.\\nAlmost 3 weeks pass, and I get a call.  They told me, my Vestax mixer isn't popular, and parts are hard to find, which they don't have the time to do.  Once again very nice while they are telling me this.  I didn't argue with them, I came back in, and took my mixer.\\nTo sum it up, the only place in Las Vegas that will look and maybe repair Dj equipment, if you have a popular/common brand/unit. My rating for this place is",

        "Saw a pre-screening of \\\"Here Comes the Boom\\\" tonight, and I had a great time!  The movie was hilarious, with cool MMA scenes (a few were too violent for me to bear), and the cast, especially Kevin James, Henry Winkler (!), and Bas Rutten surprised me with their comedic energy.  Selma Hayek was good, too.  But of course, this review should be about Harkins Shea 14, and what can I say, but the picture and sound were very good.  While my preferred spot is somewhere in the middle and not too close, I knew it would be improbable tonight, since I'd arrived later than I had planned (passes were for 7p viewing, and it's recommended to show up as early as 6p to secure seats).  It didn't look like I'd make the cut, but at the last second, ten more were allowed in- yay!  \\n\\nIt was my first visit, the movie was in a smaller viewing room, and I wasn't able to check out the state of the women's restroom, but I'd come back to check out other movies in the future.  It was a bit chilly inside towards the end, so I recommend you bring a sweater if you're prone to feeling cold indoors.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

The employees in the produce section are also amazing, as many of them can spout off a recipe for any particular item they sell, with a story and a smile.\\n\\nThat said, the traffic in and out of this place is pretty rough, and the prices on random items are much higher than you might expect, while the average price of items are actually pretty darn good.  Hummus is ridiculously expensive.  Juice is cheap.  Dunno.\\n\\nEvery time we go here, we come out highly stressed, which sucks.

The service was fantastic, with a wait time around seven minutes. Curious about their tea, our server allowed us to have a sample (in a rather large cup) of their green tea. Ultimately, we didn't order any tea, but our server provided consistent, positive service. My boyfriend and I ordered a large Da' Greek pizza for our meal. While the pizza combination was delicious, I did find a slight flaw. The only thing I didn't like was the amount of moisture soaked into the crust. I'm not sure if that's how the pizza is supposed to be, but it was almost impossible to eat without a fork. There was enough pizza to take home though, and the leftovers lasted us for a couple of days. Also, be sure to try the Cider. SO GOOD! My rating for this place is",

I asked for mine with well done peppers onions and mushrooms no lettuce or tomato. I get there and the total is over $24! So I ask why.

They can completely fail to deliver due to their own problems, ruin your vacation and cause you to spend money without regard or refund. Can you imagine any other business where they can take your money in advance, then make you wait for hours before not telling you that they aren't going to deliver at all, then refuse to refund? It's an outrageous scam!\\nOur first problem was that their Flight 2834 did not arrive at Burbank from Phoenix to take us from Burbank to Phoenix to connect us with our flight 305 to Charlotte, which made it an emergency to book with Southwest to make the connection at a cost of $189.70 x 2 for the total of $379.40\\nThen they had another three hour delay for the same trip on the way home. They should be legally required to refund services not rendered at least. Then we had to suffer through arrogant and unhelpful customer service only to find out they would only give us credit for $25 in total for two passengers.\\nThink about the risks before opting for a slightly cheaper fair. My rating for this place is",

        "Review: OVERPRICED AND OVERRATED!!!!\\n\\nI cannot believe how much money I spent here for two sandwiches and two sodas.  $25.46\\n\\nThe mozzerlla panini had tasteless tomatoes, the thinnest slice of procutto that had a large peice of fat in it causing me to nearly gag.  Plesto sauce was okay.\\n\\nThe roast beef sandwhich was a huge dissappointement.  Two thick slices of overdone beef, two thick slices of cheese and a tasteless tomatoe with the top hard vine connector still attached (who wants to eat that?).  When I say thick, I mean, 1/6 thick but did not cover from side to side of the bread.  \\n\\nThese sandwhiches were $9.50 each!!!!\\n\\nWe got one with pasta salad (corkscrew pasta and a dressing, no veggies or color) and a green salad (lettuce and dressing, nothing else).\\n\\nWe also got two diet cokes.  In a can!!!!  For $2.25 each!!  They did'nt offer a glass, ice and straw which in my oppinion might account for the upcharge, but no, nothing, niet.\\n\\nThis place might be okay if you are in the area, at the building working or visiting someone, but we drove from Ahwatukee.  So not worth it.  Do not drive to this place.  Do not go out of your way for this place.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Every review talks about the good food but let's start elsewhere, the bathrooms.  The bathroom is unisex sinks with separate doors for each stall.  Each room has it's own theme and music.  I love the creativity in something so often overlooked by most restaurants.  \\n\\nI've been here twice and had a great experience both times.  The first time I got the Italia Salad.  It was very large with lots of meat and cheese.  It was very tasty.  I followed that up by an ice cream sandwich which was at least 4x too big for me.  The cookie was fresh and warm with the ice cream wedged in between.  I say that baby is fit for 2 large adults or 3-4 people that know their limit.\\n\\nThe 2nd time I got the Italia sandwich.  It was fantastic.  The potato salad I chose as a side was good too.  Too often places overcook the hell out of the potatoes and it turns into mush.  Theirs still had some texture which was nice.  It was a very satisfying meal.  We chased our dish with their signature espresso which is a micro latte (two baby lattes). \\n\\nI love the uniqueness of the original brick wall, and the exposed wooden trusses that make up the roof.  Even the seemingly simple light bulbs are unique with a hoop-earring looking filament within them.  They have a brick oven for pizzas and a huge display for those tempting deserts.  In addition to the espresso bar they also have a nice selection of beer and wine.  This is a great lunch spot in an area of town not known for independent and unique dining options.  \\n\\nWorth the drive from Tempe.  It often is quite busy but they are good at cleaning tables and reserving seats for people in line.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

They actually know how to make them, which is a step ahead of almost everyone else around here.  Their fries aren't bad either.  A bit pricey unless you catch one of their specials.  Good lunch place, plenty of tv's, friendly staff.  Nothing compared to authentic Chicago food, but again, the closest I've found out here so far. My rating for this place is",

        "Given that this is presently my \\\"home airport\\\" I'd better know it enough to review it given that I feel quick to comment on the other airports I've been through.\\n\\nBottom line: the place is relatively clean, easy to navigate (in comparison) and is almost done up-fitting the retail to come up to the current trend of \\\"mall-like\\\" experiences.  \\n\\nAll terminals are span out from a center like the hub and spoke system of the airlines.  The center court in the middle is best known for its cluster of shoppes, restaurants and (best loved) row of white rocking chairs that ironically back up to the people-mover walkways.  People watching, alone, is worth the price of admission and the vast open space feels busy and energetic during prime time, but never stuffy.\\n\\nE Terminal is they newest and definitely feels so. If you fly international from Charlotte, you will be there.  Seems there is a bigger selection of stores here but all terminals have some options.\\n\\nFor those parking at Charlotte, you've got the usual choices of hourly, daily, long-tern and remote- each with successive price decreases but increasing distances from the terminal.  A flurry of busses constantly circuits from the lots to the terminal and, unless you arrive late at night, are plentiful and well-marked.  After hours we have much better success contacting an airport employee to let them know which bus we fare looking for.  Just remember where you park- long term one is very different from long term 2!\\n\\nFor those wanting a higher level of service, there is also terminal level valet and business valet.  While I get the convenience of pulling up to the terminal and dropping off they keys, I do not understand the business valet- it is further away than remote parking and you still have to ride a bus.  Yes, they will change your oil and clean the car (for an additional price) but the premium you pay here does not justify the product.  My advice: skip business valet entirely.\\n\\nOtherwise, CLT is a typical airport but modern, clean, and open...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nI have gone to this salon a few times before and had not had such a horrible experience as I did the last time. I went in for a cut and color. My hair was long, almost close to my behind. I had a few layers and asked for the shortest layer to be blended in to the rest of my hair. I didn't want a lot taken off the ends and asked that only about an inch be cut off the ends. They started with the color which was fine at the time, but not true once I got home and looked at it in different lighting. It was blotchy. OK, I could deal with this color....Whatever. But when it came to my cut I think the student had no idea how to layer hair. She left my hair with very short layers that it looked as if I had a very long mullet. Not even the instructor was able to fix this huge mistake. When I heard her tell the student that she had \\\"cut into it\\\", I knew something was wrong. Seriously, all the instructor and the student could say was that they were sorry. Oh yeah, the instructor said that I didn't have to pay for the hair cut. I was so upset with what was done to my hair and the way it looked that I asked them to cut off seven or eight inches so that it could blend in with the rest of my short hair, and look somewhat decent. I can still see the choppyness of my hair and it is still not even half way decent, but after the hair is cut, there is really nothing that can be done.\\n\\nAfter I got home and really started going through my hair, all I could was cry and scream. \\n\\nOh one other thing. Because my hair was so long they had to use two extra bowls of color and I was charged for those two bowls, this would not be a problem had I gotten the haircut that I asked for, but being that my hair was so short afterwards and had I gone into the salon with that short of hair I would not have had to have two extra bowls of hair color. I know that these are students and I expect that they will make some mistakes some times but this was HUGE. I don't understand how they could put a student on the floor to work on clients if the...\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nDecided to hit this place before hitting on 12 while the dealer shows a 9 at the Rivers.   We didn't have a reservation but the server seated us anyways (we had to be done by 7).  It is BYOB but they deal you a $4 corkage fee per person drinking.  The bread sticks were fresh and warm and were the perfect accompaniment to the delicious soup du jour, potato soup.  The side salad that comes with the meal would make the hall of fame for any side salad league.  It came with olives, Gorgonzola, julienned carrots and other veggies.  I had the pork tenderloin with veggies and mashed potatoes.   The tenderloin was perfectly cooked and the mashed potatoes were like having two aces in the hole.   It would be tough to find a better waitstaff.   Plates disappeared, water was filled, and I never knew they were there.  If your looking for a place to try before going to the casino or bucco game this is a sure bet, just call ahead for reservations.  They do have outdoor seating but the views wont show up on any postcard.  PS The 7:00 reservation called to say they were going to be late so we were allowed to relax at the table till 7:30.\n\nStars:",

For the price of a McDonald's value meal, you can fill up on salad, soup, breadsticks, baked potatoes, tuna salad, and a whole bunch of other stuff.  \\n\\nI've seen people review its decor, and I thought I should add that the decor isn't all that great, but I don't go to Jack In the Box for its atmosphere either.  If you're looking for an inexpensive meal that still gives you a great value for your dollar, try it.   \\n\\nHits:  \\n* Tuna salad, Potato salad are pretty good.\\n* There's one soup that tastes strangely like Spaghetti-Os.  \\n* The breadsticks are always remarkably fresh and soft\\n* The poundcake cubes\\n\\nMisses:\\n* Soggy cardboard with a dash of ketchup should not ever be labeled \\\"pizza\\\"\\n* Service.  It always looks like it's severely understaffed, although the people they do have genuinely try and do a good job.  \\n* None of the food items are so memorable that I really want to go back and get them again.

One is a bar with waiters and liquor, the other is a fast food style place. I chose the latter. Walk in and you will find a menu board with a few specials printed out hanging off of it, no frills, no credit cards, all local flavor.\\n\\nI went with the Titanic special $10.75 Which included a \\\"monster\\\" fish sandwich, and two sides, I chose fries and onion rings.\\n\\nEverything is made to order, which means crispy fries, rings and a crust on hot flakey fish. The fish here is the real thing not some unnatural square, a large fillet of mild white fish with a great breading on a simple bun. The condiments are on the table and up to you, tartar sauce, hot sauce, a spicy \\\"famous\\\" vinegar and ketchup.

One guy started cleaning the floors instead of working on my car and the guy who was at the beginning of the car wash finally came and cleaned my car at 7:56 PM... four minutes before they were suppose to close. Don't really see the point in staying open late when you care more about going home than finishing cleaning my car.

        "wish there were stars in the negative. i actually had geico insurance until they scammed me and did the same with 4 others that i know of. basically; i put my payment on auto for ease and simply made sure i always had money to cover the payment. one day i get stoped by the police because \\\"your registration has been suspended due to lack of payment\\\". well i only found this out after geico had suspended it without notifing me by mail or phone call. so; i go to the dmv only to find out it will cost 750.00 to reinstate the registration and i will be listed as a high risk driver which will raise my rates. when i asked geico why they didn't call me the response was \\\"that is a luxury that we do if we have time\\\".\\nnow if that wasn't bad enough geico is trying to collect money on that time they suspended my registration.\\nbottom line is this; insurance company's all quote rates which tend to be almost identical to each other. so; why take the risk with geico and becaome another victim of their scam?\nSo I would like to give it",

The bathrooms are lovely with separate shower and tub. \\nThe grand foyer is beautiful as is the huge patio with fire pits. The pools are nice but I must admit they aren't keeping up with my kid's ages. We started going when the boys were 3 & 5 - now they are 10 & 12 and looking for higher slides and a lazy river. \\nWe do enjoy the short boat rides to the Western Town. They have a running path about 1.5 miles long out into the desert and near the golf course. We enjoy walking near the little river and sitting on the little grass island. We have golfed here it's a Troon golf course and beautiful. \\nA visit here is typically a serene weekend for us watching the horses, bunnies and birds. My rating for this place is",

        "Review: This was the first time I had been to a Red Lobster in my life, and from what I have heard, they were like a seafood-centric version of Sizzler. Not in the least.. I must say I had a nice time here from the beginning to end. The server was courteous and prompt, the appetizer bread was surprisingly good, and the entrees were very tasty. I had the Surf and Turf, expecting the steak to be sub-par. I love steak, and this was excellent steak. Perfectly cooked and coupled with Lobster tails (2). I don't really dig on seafood, so this is a place I won't be frequenting, but I highly recommend and would gladly come back. I actually \\\"sent my regards to the chef\\\", like a dork...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nThe only reason I go to this location is strictly out of convenience, but after today I will inconvenience myself to drive to another location. The ONLY reason we went to this location today was because we decided at the last minute to get Chipotle, now I wish we went to the location off Rural and Baseline I believe. \\n\\nFirst off the place was a hot mess today. Food ALL OVER the floor in the dining area. Yes there were kids there and I know they can be messy but WOW food, rice and paper(yes I said paper, did not know that paper was on the menu, must be new) was all over the floor. Ya know I don't expect places to be completely spotless by any means but at the same time it's just not appealing to see stuff all over the place. \\n\\nSecond, the customer service or should I say lack of customer service. If I wanted attitude and nasty looks by the employees I'd go to the MVD because you know everyone there hates their job and has no issue sharing/displaying that to others. The first guy in the food was just gave me a look of \\\"yeah lady I know what the \\\"f\\\" I'm doing\\\" with slight attitude, I move along and get my carnitas, beans and rice slightly annoyed. THEN comes the guy that puts the salsa, cheese sour cream and whatever  else you might want. Once again I get the same look as the last guy, just a little more dominant accompanied by MORE attitude. This guy also decides to OBVIOUSLY completely miss my taco with the sour cream and put in in between the two. Thank you guy, I really didn't want it on my taco, I like to eat it by itself. At this point I just want to get my food and leave. \\n\\nThird, I will have to say that this trip was better than the last. The last one, my boyfriend had to practically hold me back from completely lashing out at the VERY incompetent employee behind the counter. My order REALLY isn't that difficult and I really don't understand why it was sooo hard to comprehend. I always get the three tacos on corn with carnitas, pinto beans, white rice, corn salsa(extra), sour cream(extra) and...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review: I feel rather sheepish writing this update. I was very impressed with my nurse, Sheila, who had year of experience and new ideas about what to do with drooping corners of my mouth and eyes. \\n\\nAfter ten days, there is improvement, but not what I was hoping for. I am disappointed. I had always gone to a dermatologist for Botox or other fillers and always got the results I was expecting.\\n\\n\\nMy husband also had Sheila use Botox on his prominent forehead lines, lines between the eyes, and crows feet. His forehead shows definite improvement, though one line is still quite noticeable, only one side of his crows feet are better, but the lines between his eyes are as deep as ever. He is very disappointed and refuses to use Voci Spa again.\\n\\nI am wondering about the quality of the Botox used, how fresh it is, if it is indeed what is used in a dermatologist's office, or if it has had other ingredients added to it. The price was $10 per unit, which is about right, though many places charge $12.\\n\\nI still think Sheila is great at knowing where and what to inject, but if management's policy is to use a less effective product, then expertise can't possibly make up the difference. \\n\\nI doubt I will return to Voci myself. Like my husband, I'll be looking for a derm's office who specializes in injectables. I am sorry I had to write this second review after my initial enthusiasm and hopefulness.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

We waited for someone to come seat us for at least 5 minutes. A manager walking out of the door had to yell that there were people up front. After being seated we ordered the 2 for $20. I got the chicken fajitas while the boyfriend got the margarita chicken and we decided to share the corn guacamole. The guacamole was nothing but avacados and jalape\\u00f1os and was pretty much inedible. My fajitas consisted of burnt chicken, three strips of bell pepper and an entire onion that was burnt. The margarita chicken was bland and the black beans looked old. The kicker was the wait staff. Not once was I asked if there was anything wrong with my food and we never got refills. When I complained about the food the waitress apologized and walked away. Will never go to another Chili's ever.\n\nReview rating:",

        "searching for a pre-made bahn mi for $3? maybe some fruit snack flavoured beef jerky? perhaps in need of a gallon container of pickled ginger? how about a new tea set? overseas market has your back. \\n\\nI might stop in for a new lamp or decorations before I go back for food (seriously, some ridic lamps and candles), but it is a nice sized store (surprisingly large) and well organized, by cuisine. Walking in, if you go to the right there is a nice snack aisle (wasabi peas, dried seaweed, pocky sticks, the filled koalas that aren't quite \\\"yummies\\\") followed by the Filipino section with super cheap dried mangoes and papayas and lots of \\\"banana sauce\\\" (that does not come with a plastic safety ring or a no-tampering pull lid on the inside, fyi) To the left are aisles of latin, indian, thai, vietnamese, and on and on. Fairly good selection, lots of dried and canned mushrooms, like an insane amount. And a lot of agar, tapioca powder, palm products, and gums. \\n\\nI have to say the produce was less than fresh. they did have a good selection of mung beans, bok choys, and cabbage (on their last leg) - but the bell peppers and jalapenos were no good and about half the selection of herbs were past their prime. \\n\\nThey had two lobsters in the tank and an assortment of fish and shrimp. There is an area devoted to cups, bowls, and other dinnerwares, but I didn't explore it thoroughly, and a decent freezer selection. An odd retail selection other items were blocking me from looked interesting, maybe I'll get to check it out next time, There is also a reach-in cooler near the register with the previously mentioned bahn mi, cheesecakes, some pork roll (log?) that I have yet to wrap my head around, and lots of kimchi.\\n\\nI prefer International Market, but if I'm on this side of town Overseas will most likely have what I need.

As for the fettuccine it was ok nothing I would brag home to mama about Ive had way better it reminded me of something I could microwave from the grocery store no flavor at all I had to put a pound of salt and pepper on it just to make it ok to eat. \\n\\nI will not be returning to Olive Garden this is Las Vegas there are way to many good restaurants to eat at rather then waste my time at this fake \\\"Italian restaurant\\\" not to mention the service was lousy.\\n\\nPlease avoid this microwave Italian food!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nOh Oregano's, how shall I rate thee?\\n\\nWhen my husband and I moved close by, we frequented this location. Or, at least tried to.\\n\\nThe parking is INSANE. This is no exaggeration. There is really, seriously no place to park. On several occasions we wanted to eat here and didn't because we had no place to leave the car. \\n\\nI was always very excited to eat here but disappointed once I was there. Everything I ordered was less than awesome. The Pablo Picasso salad was dry, with very little dressing, and way spicier than described in the menu. The Southwestern Shrimp salad is supposed to be on a \\\"bed of fried noddles.\\\" Sounds decadently delicious, right? It tasted like cooked and re-dried spaghetti. Literally inedible! The Big 'Ole Vedge sandwich sounds amazing but tastes totally bland, no flavor whatsoever. My husband has given the Italian Wedding soup a few different tries, but finds it is always way too salty. He gives their pasta the general description of \\\"bland\\\"; no matter which one he ordered, they all tasted the same. \\n\\nThe only awesome food here is the pizookie cookie. A decadent, AMAZING dessert that, now that I think about it, I can easily make at home for half the cost and none of the hassle. \\n\\nOh and the wait. An hour, minimum. No exceptions. You will always wait at Oregano's. My husband and I went so far as to CALL to put our names in, WALK to the restaurant, as parking is impossible, and we STILL had to wait nearly an hour! \\n\\nI keep wanting to give them another try, I'm not sure why, but my husband is having none of it.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review: It's been a LONG time since I've been to one and I wasn't expecting too much since the only thing I recalled was liking the lemonade and bottomless fries. Anyway, Ruben and I met up with a couple of friends on a busy Sunday afternoon. They were thoughtful enough to mention to our server that I would be looking for Vegetarian eats, so I was given the allergy binder (yeah, no information for Vegetarians, just FYI).\\n\\nI ordered the Bacon Guacamole Burger with a substitution of a Gardenburger\\u00ae and removed the bacon and mayo. I did indulge in the bottomless fries, but was really disappointed that you're given less than ten fries to start. Seriously? I know it's unlimited, but give people a nice amount and maybe you won't have multiple orders of more fries. Our server was really great though and I asked her to bring us more as soon as we got our orders (this took a while, but like I mentioned, it was busy). I liked the Gardenburger\\u00ae (first time trying it, but I had done research between this and Boca Burgers; I like the idea of vegetables in a patty form rather than soy meat) and the guacamole was okay. There was barely any flavor and the vegetables were blah (the shredded lettuce was sad). The bun was all right, a tad dry. Overall, not pleased. The fries were disappointing too! I remember them being so much better too. I know they're probably just from a frozen bag, but it was not cooked well (WAY too oily) and the Red Robin Seasoning I remember enjoying was just meh too. Anyway, I thought maybe I didn't enjoy my burger since it was a \\\"healthy\\\" version, however, I took a bite of Ruben's Burnin' Love Burger and it was just okay. He, not being as picky as I am, thought everything was just okay as well.\\n\\nMy verdict? That was my last time dining there. Nothing phenomenal and with so many awesome burger joints in the valley, you can absolutely get something more for your money (and for just a couple dollars more).\\n\\nNotes: this location is in Galleria Mall near the front, main entrance off Sunset.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The food on the plate ran together.  It looked like soup.  We couldn't even make out the enchiladas as they were covered with the rice and soup-like sauce.   It was an awful presentation.  The sauce around the edges of the plate looked like it had been overcooked and burned.  The meat in the taco was seasoned really weird.  It was awful.  I couldn't eat it.

        "Review text:\nI had heard a lot of different things about Cain's before coming here for the first time around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. What I heard was true after dining here- food is really good, service leaves a lot to be desired. Two of us were the first to arrive for a party of six. We waited a good 10 minutes at the \\\"please wait to be seated sign\\\". No one even acknowledged us standing there until two other members of our party finally arrived. They were semi busy but cleared out quickly since it was a 4:25 steelers game and several tables there looked like they were heading to the game. Anyways, a server came over about 5 minutes after we were sat. To get our drink order. She was pretty slow getting our drinks out to us. The other two members of our party arrived by then and when she came back she said the kitchen was running 30 minutes behind and we should order appetizers now if we wanted any. Ok so we ordered 6 old bay wings, 12 thai chili wings, and 2 orders of the cheese sticks. The cheese sticks were the best cheese sticks I have ever eaten! They are huge-3 to an order but these are so thick and gooey....and the marinara served with them is a sweeter marinara, it's very good. I didn't try the old bay wings but they were quickly devoured by the rest of the table. The Thai chili wings had a very nice sweeter flavor. And they were large wings too. Very tasty. She came to take our food order prior to our appetizers coming out. They did take awhile but she did warn us they were slow. Entrees came out quickly however. I had ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. It had a horseradish BBQ sauce that sounded really interesting. The server came over halfway through the appetizers and said they ran out of the pulled pork. I was disappointed but I ordered a turkey Rachael with sweet potato waffle fries instead. The sandwich came on marble rye with coleslaw Swiss and thousand island. The fries weren't great and we're kind of soggy. The sandwich though was excellent. Real rotisserie turkey and lots of cold slaw which is...\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review: A huge restaurant with a decent parking space. Upon entering I was very confused by the decor. It would seem that the restaurant was either experiencing an identify crisis between being Chinese/Vietnamese or the Vietnamese people just took over a Chinese restaurant. The decor was also very tacky and outdated. Water lines and paint chipping off is evident around the restaurant. Not detoured by the atmosphere we were seated promptly. The server was nice and the service was decent. We ordered the shrimp spring rolls and garlic chicken. The shrimp spring rolls tasted delightful - fresh and light. On the other hand, the garlic chicken was OKAY. The chicken was cooked perfectly. However the sauce was hideous. You could not taste the garlic and it just seemed like they masked the friend chicken with teriyaki sauce. If i were them I would just dust the chicken with garlic powder and lightly fry it. The price was fair. Overall this place is ok. However due to the tacky decor, identity crisis and weird sauce I would not come back. Cheers!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "When I first started coming here it was good. The service on the other hand could of been better. Their dinner here is always good no matter what. All the food on their menu is always cooked perfectly. They even have a lunch special menu if you come within the lunch hours. My boyfriend and I used to come here at least once a week or once every 2 weeks. \\n\\nComing from a family where my mom works in the food and beverage industry, she has always taught me to ALWAYS give tip no matter how bad the service is or how horrible the food is. Just put down a dollar at least. My boyfriend also having his dad in the same industry he taught him the same exact thing..\\n\\nWhen the waiters/waitresses gives us the check we pay the bill first and then place down the tip on the table before we leave the restaurant. I guess one of the waitress recognizes us and one day comes to us while handing us the receipt she has the nerve to tell us that we don't tip or that her other co-workers tells her that we don't like to tip. \\nSo when she gives us the bill she asks us \\n\\\"Do you guys not like to tip because the service is bad?\\\" \\nAnd then we answered\\n\\\"No, we always tip. Even if the service was bad we tip.\\\"\\n\\nThen after that little conversation we had, she backed off and didn't say a word. When we were about to leave I told my boyfriend to only leave a dollar on the damn table. They didn't deserve any more than a dollar because they had the damn nerve to talk to us about tips. \\n\\nSo since then, we've never been back and never will. This place is good for the lunch specials but the company isn't gonna get our money no more.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "This is clearly a hidden gem. Props to Phoenix for keeping these ruins as a tourist attraction. Learning more about the HOHOKam tribe also made me learn why the Cubs never win. This tribe disappeared back in 1450 and nobody know exactly why or what happened. The Cubs named their spring training park after this tribe, so you can see the anaology  hopefully. It is 6 bucks to enter and after a short movie, hit the trail to see what's left of this tribe. My favorite part was looking at the ancient ballfield and wondering what went down in those gladiator arena's years ago. Actually, it was supposedly a marketplace, but there were photos of athletic games taking place also. These Indian tribes were smart back in the day and the canals and structures built were truly a marvel of their times.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Great for large groups! They have rooms with tables that can accomodate up to 12 at one table equipped with a large lazy susan. Food is also usually fast. I say usually as one dinner trip, it took us close to 45 min to be served and tables that came in after us were served before us and we saw one couple leave after waiting for a while. Service is a hit or miss, really depends on the day and who serves you. We have seen bad and we have seen great but keep in mind it isn't a five star French restaurant when setting expectations. Decor is a bit dark and dated. Not a big deal for us, we will continue to visit as we heart their mapo tofu. Mangolian beef with the soft wraps and chinese broccoli with oyster sauce are also on our reg list. \\nOften comes up on Groupon, we usually buy one our two. My rating for this place is",

        "Here is the problem with Havana Cafe:  Its overpriced.  I ordered a Emparedado Cubano sandwich as carry out.  I liked it.  It was tasty and came with french fries and moros (black beans and rice concoction).  It was supposed to come with cabbage salad but that appeared to be missing in action when I opened the box.  \\n\\nIt cost me $16.  \\n\\nIf I pay that much for a sandwich, french fries, and rice/blackbeans, they need to be amongst the most delicious things I've tasted in order to justify that.

It is unique but if I wanted to grill my own steak I would go start my own grill in my backyard and save about 20 bucks. \\n\\nThe meat selection is good, and the cuts are definetly the weight you pay for if not more. The worst part of this place is simply the insane price for a steak you cook yourself.. the salad bar not being all that great (the lettuce was very low and picked over quite a bit when I was there), and the fact you are sweating when you get back to the table from standing by a hot grill for the past 15 min cooking your steak. \\n\\nIt is a cool place don't get me wrong.. and the food is good.. just can't justify the cost.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I've also heard some good things about their lamb dishes, but the chicken leaves me in doubt.\\n\\nI have no idea how traditional, authentic, or whatever adjective is used to describe the food at Husnu's... it's pretty mediocre for me and I wouldn't eat there again unless a friend dragged me in.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

The platter included a nice helping of whitefish salad, cream cheese,  lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, capers, olives and pickles along with a toasted bagel.   The salad was very smoky and  tasty, and everything seemed fresh except for the olives, which were very strange and mushy.\\n\\nThe problem with trying to eat in a place that smells so bad and looks so dirty is that it's hard to get past all of that to really enjoy the food.

That's because I did a review for Mulligan's Border just a couple of weeks ago and touted it as my \\\"Cheers\\\" bar because we go there so often and everyone knows our names. Well this isn't our \\\"Cheers\\\" Mulligan's but it is owned by the same people, but with a twist. The bar is run by the people that run our Mulligan's, however; the grill end is run by Wholesome Foods of Las Vegas. (http://www.wholesomefoodslasvegas.com) That throws a bit of a spin on the review because now the review may be for Mulligan's Landing but it's really for the room run by Wholesome Foods. Get it? Yeah I know, weird, but these kinds of cooperative business arrangements happen more often than you may think in Las Vegas.\\n\\nSo here is the skinny... Wholesome Foods is a boxed lunch caterer, therefore the food served at this restaurant is their boxed lunch on a plate. The good news... the food is awesome. My wife and I were only looking for a quick Iced Tea but when we browsed the menu for S&Gs and noticed Chicken Quesadillas and ordered up the appetizer. We were waited on by the chef (yes chef, from Le Cordon Bleu no less as displayed on his chefs coat) and got to talking and we decided to try the Shaved Roast Beef Sandwich with a creamy slaw. The food was as advertised and pretty darn good. Good use of spice in the quesadillas gave them some zip and the Pico was fresh. The Roast Beef was very tasty and tasted confit if a bit salty. The slaw on the other hand was great. It was cream with a bit of what has to be champagne vinegar to give it a nice zing.\\n\\nThe d\\u00e9cor was \\\"Areo\\\" inspired because it is right across from the NLV Airport. You get the feeling that back in the day this had to be a favored hangout of pilots and crews in the aviation biz.\\n\\nIn the past this establishment has suffered from mismanagement apparently but you have the feeling that the staff is trying hard to correct that. Service what very good and the people in the place seemed happy.\\n\\nThis will not be a hangout...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Ok look if you have money, these people are practically eating from your hands. Most business are this way. However, I must be fair in what I say, They do have great live music entertainment in the summer time from Thursdays to Sundays 7pm to 11pm. It is free. However when my family and I came to enjoy some good music, we had sat at one of there outside tables to enjoy. We figured we would buy something so they would not complain about us just sitting there. Since I do not like to drink in front of my daughter, I bought some crackers and cheese from inside. After about 30 minutes they asked us to leave the tables and sit elsewhere because ALL of their tables were reserved for people drinking. They were very rude about it. This will not drive me away from coming here, just from giving them anymore of my money! My rating for this place is",

On this creepy, weird, strike up the Deliverance theme song, strip of Van Buren sits a gay honky tonk bar. Where, perhaps, \\\"squeal like a pig\\\" is not so frowned upon. It's basically a large shed plastered with neon beer signs, a few rainbow flags thrown in and, on Sundays, a great mixed, mostly gay crowd, all revved up for the beer bust. Great burgers and dogs, grilled right there on the patio. Friendly bartenders and beer, beer, beer and more beer. Obligatory pool tables and dart boards for those who need a break from cruisin and there's even a dance floor the size of a cocktail napkin for those who dare to make the first move.

        "Dec. 2010: I ended up here by accident, having gone to Golden Corral to try out their dinner only to be told at the door that they were closed for an employee party.  I spent about 15 minutes in their parking lot (phone server was running slow) poring over my options in the area and decided to give this place a try.  It was about 8pm.\\n\\nIt wasn't crowded at all so I was seated right away. The waitress kind of surprised me when she plopped down across from me and started talking to me like I was somebody she knew, but I kind of got a kick out of it.  I had looked at the menu and the hostess told me on the way in that her favorite was the sirloin so I decided to get it. It was under $11, which I thought was reasonable. It came with two sides so I got green beans and seasoned rice.  Rolls are provided right away and there is a bucket of peanuts on the table to hold you while you wait.  The rolls were excellent, soft and yeasty, with a cinnamon butter that was delicious but sweet and better suited for dessert.  The green beans were kind of salty but cooked in bacon and had good flavor, the rice was unimpressive, sort of reminded me if a rice-a-roni, but that steak was perfect!  It was so tender I barely needed a knife to cut it and had a nice grilled flavor.  \\n\\nI found out they had an early bird special menu and returned 10 days later to try it.  I got a  Chicken Fried Steak smothered in gravy with sides of Caesar Salad and mashed potatoes.  For a dollar extra I got them \\\"loaded,\\\" topped with grated cheese, butter, onions, sour cream and a side of brown gravy--more toppings than potatoes!  All were good although the steak was very salty.  \\n\\nI wanted to get back there again before I left town but didn't make it since I returned to San Diego a week later.\\n\\nNov. 2012:  I'm back in town and finally got back here, barely squeaked in by the 6pm deadline for the early bird steak dinner.

I got the wrong sized belt so I wanted to exchange it with one that was slightly bigger. Keep in mind that the item had been purchased the day before and had never been worn. The lady went to the back for like ten minutes - and when she came out she said she couldn't exchange my item because someone had put a hole in my belt to make it even smaller (which doesn't make sense because the belt was too small to begin with).

        "I have been coming here for years and never considered it an exceptionally amazing but loved the happy hour and their crazy monkey roll. Well I decided to come here just for that last weekend. It was not busy at all which is very strange as it was prime time on a weekend night and we were seated outside. Let me bottom line it: the food has completely gone downhill and the service is TERRIBLE. Our waiter was nice but seemed kind of new because he would rarely come around to check on us... like 20 minute intervals at least. My husband didn't like his iced green tea so he asked he send it back, he forgot my husband's replacement drink order until we asked again for it. He said he \\\"comped\\\" us for the iced green tea even though we drank hardly any of it and asked for it to be sent back. He never brought us water, I had to walk inside and ask the bartender for water. He forgot the soy sauce and ramekins for our sushi, so my husband had to walk inside and ask for this as well. We're not particularly picky people but when we get a night out we expect basic service. \\n\\nNow on to the food, I used to LOVE the crazy monkey rolls. I mean I craved them so much it's the reason I went there last weekend. To my disappointment, it was sloppily put together and there was more cream cheese in there than anything. It actually did not even taste good.\\n\\nLong story short, due to the terrible service and decreasing quality of their food we will not be returning unless it only for happy hour drinks or something. There are far better sushi places in the area with comparable prices, Sakana is amazing for example.\nSo I would like to give it",

It was a gift from a friend so I am not sure how much the services run but I have to say that I was very happy with the outcome! \\n\\nI've only had my makeup done professionally a few times in my life (minus the quick touch ups from department store counters).\\n\\nI wasn't a cake face mess (this was a huge fear) and it stayed all day.  I liked it so much that I even bought some custom foundation afterwards.  It was under $30 for the foundation and it looks like it will last for a long time.  I don't normally ever wear it, but I really liked the stuff they used on me, it felt natural and really evened out my skin tone.\\n\\nI recommend Palmina Leone, wish I could get my face done more often!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

In general the crowd is a bunch of pretentious pricks, which I'm not crazy about, but the food here is impeccable! It has an awesome wine list and great service. Consistency of preparation with fresh ingredients are what has made Morton's one of my favorite places in The Valley. The food there was prepared exactly as I had ordered it, and the wait staff is most accommodating. The bar scene is your average young, scantily-clad women with the older men wearing jeans and trying to look relevant. All in all Morton's is a safe bet.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

They kept taking other peoples car who had come in after me, probably because they weren't making much money off of me.  It took them at least a half hour to actually change the bulb- I looked over and 4 people were under the hood trying to figure it out.

I brought my boyfriend here from out of town, and this was his absolute favorite restaurant out of all the other places we ate at.  A big reason was because they serve complimentary house corn salsa with their chips - he LOVES corn salsa.  (Though I think their corn salsa bowl can be much more generous.)  \\n\\nThey're tacos are delicious and unique - love their soft taco shells!!! They're fried but still soft and decadent.  Amazing.  I ordered both types of fish taco on the menu, and they were great.  Will definitely order again.\\n\\nAmbiance/decoration - lively, colorful & fun.  I absolutely love the Day of the Dead paintings - which I could take them down and have them in my own apartment.

I've heard some pretty decent local bands here, 80's night used to be pretty amazing (I haven't been there in like, 2 years because all I ever do is work, damn I hate growing up!), friends of mine used to DJ on Mixed Tape Wednesdays - that was pretty rad (where else would you hear Chromeo and Portishead and City & Colour all in one night). I dig the food specials but don't be fooled! They do not have a full menu. The veggie tacos are steller and the seitan wings are good but very small. I only drink beer but the martini menu has some offerings that sound pretty yummy. Nights start off pretty slow but by midnight the place (especially the dance floor) gets pretty crowded. Because it is situated along Carson Street, the crowd is usually diverse - a lot of regulars and a lot of crawlers just stopping in on their way from one bar to the next.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

V was very gentle on my face and shaped my brows well for my face, as I rarely wear makeup, so having nicely shaped brows helps frame one's face much better.\\n\\nShe spoke to me quietly in a room in the back and the table thing she had me on looked sanitary, and a disposable plastic cover to rest my head on.  No one was shouting in the salon as they do at Jimmy's.\\n\\nI'm so glad that I gave this place a try as I found it on my way to Target and on the way home, so it is also not out of the way.  They are way more professional here than at Jimmy's.  The brow waxing was $12, which is double the price of Jimmy's, but for a cleaner place, friendlier, more professional people, and a much better job, it's worth the extra $6.\\n\\nThank you!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "We have been here other times and I don't remember ever having an issue. We stopped here for quick breakfast on the way out of town a few days ago. I did not pay attention to the drive-through but I think it was average busy, there were like 0 to 2 other customers inside at the time...\\nWe placed our order, and it kind of took a little while, which I am fine with because I understand sometimes the cashier may be new, or in training... \\nHubby had gone to Costco to get gas in the mean time... he came back and we sat to wait (4 people)...\\n5 minutes went by... 10 minutes went by... I asked if it was going to take long and someone told me it was because it was a big order... I do not know what the confusion was... We ran out of patience and went to check again... Finally our order was ready and it took over 15 minutes from the time in my receipt... We usually do fast food breakfast when we go out of town and it may take 15 minutes for us to be in and out, ordering, getting our food, AND eating...\\n\\nOur daughter thought I was making a big deal out of it, but this is called a **fast food** place, and we were in fact in a hurry...\\n\\nOK, so we left and I gave everyone their meal... only to find out the last one (mine) was not what I ordered... at this time I was not willing to spend much energy on this, so we didn't go back... later in the day I found out my order along with other sandwich was at the bottom of the bag... so they did mess up the order but my food was in there... I just didn't see it... I only regret that maybe someone else was missing those items in their order : (\\n\\nBut the unthinkable, and the one I cannot wrap my head around, is that we had ordered a box of churros and... They didn't cover them in sugar and cinnamon! that is unforgivable : P\\nIt bothers me enough when they don't do it evenly and some of them have sugar/cinnamon, and some have barely any... but skipping it altogether? I would give them zero stars if I could...\\n\\nI know this is making me sound like I am a very demanding person,...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Luckily everything is numbered and there are lots of pictures so making a fool of myself by trying to pronounce the menu items was optional. I didn't even really notice the menu on the table until after I'd ordered off the one handed to me, lots of great sounding items I'll have to try in the future. \\n\\nThe rolls arrived within 90 seconds of placing the order. I was very surprised and the dipping sauce was perfect. I'm often skeptical of sauces sprinkled with peanuts as I've found it means you're about to dip into pure peanut overkill, but the sauce was balanced really well. The rolls themselves were nice- crunchy/crisp insides and the paper wasn't the pre-made &sitting out rubbery mess I almost expected since they arrived so quickly.\\n\\nAbout three bites into my roll, my pho arrives. A really nice balance of broth to filling ratio, lots of noodles, lots of reaaaaally long fatty pieces of steak that made me happy no one was sitting across the table watching me attempt to eat them, and was served with the plate of bean sprouts/basil/lime/hot peppers slices. \\n\\nSriracha was plentiful, water was filled as needed, and the restaurant itself was fairly quiet, though I felt like if I had arrived an hour earlier during the peak lunch time it would have been a different story. All of the service staff I interacted with was extremely friendly and I will definitely be returning for more!\n\nReview rating:",

They also forgot to put the fuel tank rubber seal back after fixing fender.  The lady looked at the bumper and said that someone probably hit my bumper and they don't cover chips caused by outside sources.  There was absolutely no sign of bumper flexing or denting and regardless, the paint was chipping way too much to have been properly done.

        "I absolutely love upscale sandwiches and salads (you know, with roasted eggplant or portabellos, herb mayo, frisee, candied walnuts, etc.) and am fortunate that frou-frou lunch offerings are pretty much par for the course in the area where I work (Chelsea's Kitchen, The Vig, Acacia, Wildflower, Bertha's, Pita Jungle, LGO, and Taylor's are all within a mile or two). However, I occasionally want something a little simpler and find myself at a place like Mamma Mia's. One day, I was scouting out my less fancy options, saw the sign for Subs by Jim, and decided to stop. \\n\\nThe woman who worked there was really friendly without being pushy and she really gave the place a family-owned and neighborhood feel. I ended up ordering the Vegetarian Cobb with light ranch (I'm not vegetarian but I often don't eat meat for lunch), a fountain soda, and a cookie to go. The food was ready very quickly and the total price was good for the area (around $10 for the three items). The salad was very large compared to ones I usually have and the ingredients were all fresh, but I thought that there could have been more of the toppings (hard-boiled eggs, avocado, etc.). \\n\\nAlthough I haven't been eating out for lunch much lately, I will probably return to Subs by Jim soon and try the sandwiches and soups that everyone is raving about!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nWow. I've been in this airport a lot, but only for connecting flights. I've never gone through security here before. I live in OKC and love our sweet little airport, but departing from Sky Harbor, I now appreciate how well-designed and thoughtfully considered our airport is. \\n\\nSo, here are just a few things that I think need a serious overhaul:\\n\\n-They didn't check my ID as I went into the line for TSA. They only looked at my boarding pass. This is weird, because it seems to me this is the one place where you have enough control to make sure you check every single person's ID against the name on the boarding pass. \\n\\n-The lines for security are whack. You pick from one of three lines, which we will call A, B and C that feed to two people, who we will call right and left. Well, left is not only pulling from A, she's also pulling from D, the pre-approved frequent travelers who use a different line. Then you have right taking from C. No one is taking from B, which unfortunately was the line I was in. Other travelers clearly saw that we had been there for a while. When the third person who arrived after us breezed through without regard, I finally got pushy and spoke up. Why not have one line that feeds into the next available agent? \\n\\n-The bag scanning line is built around a 90-degree angle, so you have to move your bags several times. There is also not much room to line up so you can't work very far ahead of your exact turn to walk through, so you waste a lot of time standing in line when you could be prepping your bins. It also seems like it would be safer in general if the agents could look down a long line and see what's happening. A lady walked through the scanner before she had pushed her bag up onto the ramp, and I felt really weird. I didn't want to move it, because it's not mine and if there is something bad in there I don't want to be seen touching it. But the alternative is to risk watching someone leave a bag behind. I had to get an agent but that took some work. \\n\\n-I actually overheard the...\n\nReview rating:",

The layout is completely different that many other stores, in part because they only had so much square footage they could add on the existing property and they had to do it within the shape allowed.  When it first reopened as a Super Center they had a lot of problems with stock outs and expired food items.  That has improved considerably but still is a problem some times.

I called the front desk, and was told someone would call me back. By 9:30am, no one had, so I called again, only to be informed that there was nothing the clerk could do, that he had called his manager.\\nNot okay. The hotel advertises Wi-Fi as available.\\nWe checked out early, heading to Starbucks for a drink and Wi-Fi. \\nI tried emailing the 3 email addresses for the hotel, and one came back to me, as the inbox was full. A second one also came back undeliverable.\\nJust not OK at all.\\nWe won't back to this hotel, though we will be back at Mayo.\n\nStars:",

        "This experience started off extremely well.  The entrance of the restaurant takes you through gates that open to an outdoor patio adorned with ivy covered walls and rod iron table and chairs.  A really unique and peaceful setting in an otherwise busy area.  The entrance to the inside of the restaurant greet you with dark, warm colors and low lighting.  A great atmosphere!\\n\\nThe service and food were another story however.  We ordered wine, appetizers, salads, and entrees.  Our appetizers came out and were okay (Sampler).  The salads and entrees followed before we could finish any of the previous courses.  Felt very rushed in what seems to be a very relaxed and intimate atmosphere.  The Caesar salad was okay.  Nothing to write home about.  The entree, however, was aweful.  \\n\\nChicken Tetrozinni (spelling??), boasted a rich cheese sauce over chicken and rotini.  I added mushrooms, which helped.  The sauce was about as rich as a freshman on the UW campus.  More like a weak alfredo than any kind of decent cheese sauce.  Not to mention, there was no (and I mean NO) flavor to the dish.  I asked for fresh cracked pepper, and they pepper mill was grinding out dust over my dish.\\n\\nAll-in-all, I give it a 2 star rating for the atmosphere.  But if you are going for a good Italian dish, there are better options within walking distance.  Too bad too. The restaurants design and atmosphere are top notch. My rating for this place is",

        "It's OK Thai food. The pad Thai was decent and while I know it's not supposed to be saucy, it was kind of dry? The tofu tasted funny but I'm no fan of tofu, so for all I know that's how's supposed to taste. \\nSpring rolls were good but I didn't care for the corn inside. \\nMasaman curry was watery, no rich flavors there. \\nThe coconut ice cream was delicious!\nSo I would like to give it",

Me and my husband crave this whenever we have an Italian craving. The service can be hit or miss when they get busy, but the food is why we come back.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nDO NOT GO HERE! I just bought a Groupon for a VIP wash. The manager said it would take 30-45minutes to get my car through, 1.5 hours later and my car hadn't even been started on. I had to leave without them finishing my car. Next, I get in my car and the light fabric was soiled with grease stain from the tires! So now I have to figure out how to get these grease stains out of the inside of my car. \\n\\n*they did offer me a free wash to come back and have my car finished but is it really worth it? I don't think so.\\n\\nUPDATE: I did end up going back for them to clean the inside of my car. The manager was very responsive to my concerns and my car ended up looking great and they finished in a timely fashion. Should have done this the first time around and I'd be a regular customer.\n\nReview rating:",

They also have a really impressive asian beer selection.\\n\\nThe restaurant interior and the service is pretty crappy, but the low low prices make up for it.\\n\\nGive it a try, but watch out for all the students.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "99% of people traveling the SAN-SJC/SFO route go directly or through LAX. I decided to be a bit adventurous and span my reach out into the desert to explore PHX, to which I have never been before. Sure it cost me 3 extra hours, but it also solidified the notion in my mind that PHX is a piece of shit. During my 2 hour layover, this is what I discovered:\\n\\n- For some reason, one satellite of Terminal A is close to empty, while the other side is barely navigable. \\n\\n- There is absolutely no good food options. All you have to choose from is your typical Burger King-style fast food and other chains that seem like a normal option but turn out to be just as bad and tasteless.\\n\\n- Everything is just so plain and boring. The walls are a nasty sandy color. The people walking through all have this monotone \\\"don't bother me\\\" look on their face, or maybe that's just what flying does to people these days. The carpets have no life in them, and neither do the employees. It's basically one big shithole.\\n\\n- Toilets are complete crap. If I move for just a slight second, that doesn't mean you have to flush everything down and spray water everywhere. That's just disgusting.\\n\\nAt least they have free Wi-Fi...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I just went here last summer for my boyfriend's parent's 50th Anniv weekend, and it was awesome!  I loved how many animals had babies there.  We had the entire family, and we spent the whole day videotaping and taking pictures of eachother in front of all the animals.  It starting raining really hard and we still had a blast running from shelter to shelter in the ponchos we bought at one of the shops.  My favorite was the Meercat play area!!  I love those little things and was able to crawl through tubes, into a glass area you can stand in and see the meerkcats around you!!\nSo I would like to give it",
