        "Review text:\nSteve is a great guy but the gyros and fries fall short of OK let alone great.  First off the gyros always sliced so thin that it quickly burns and curls on spit when cut. That Would put you out of business in Chicago. Next the toppings are weak and need to be improved. The pita is ok but not worthy of my mouth or money. Now the fries, come on guys these fries are greasy and no flavor Steve turn the temp on the fryer to 350 and they will fry properly.  Stop giving us greasy fries they suck buddy.  Gyros needs to be flavorful and juicy you know that, but many places here have no idea how to make that happen.  I wish I could have a gyros like central gyros or costas gyros back home. Your sauce is good but that's just not enough to earn more stars.  I will submit this to the AZ papers as well maybe just selling the business would be best.  The gyros here should be free.  Come Steve better gyros for all is needed.  I mean dry and burnt just doesn't work man. I will be watching this place and informing others if things improve.  Peace.\n\nStars:",

        "Review: First time eating here and it was really good. I went with the basic gyro plate. I love meats roasted on a spit! This includes gyro meat, yellow rice, salad, hummus, pita, and portion cup of tzatziki.  It is a large portion, two people could easily share one dinner. With a drink the total was $10 and change.\\n\\nGyro meat was very flavorful! I liked the hummus. The rice was a little greasy, but not too bad. There were plenty of people here, so that's a good sign. I look forward to eating here again!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I don't know if it's worth wasting my very first ever 1 star review on US Airways, but I feel pretty slighted!  It's been two months and I'm still compelled.  ;)\\n\\nI bought a 2 leg itinerary with US Airways operating the first leg through their Star Alliance.  My flight was delayed by an hour and late into Denver.  The connecting flight to Vancouver on United was two terminals away and I had no boarding pass yet (can't print boarding passes for connecting flights on a different airline, so I hear).  Needless to say, I was unable to make the connecting flight and needed to reschedule.  The folks at United got me rescheduled for the next morning but referred me to the US Airways desk to see about my hotel since US Airways' flight into Denver was late.\\n\\nI'm still agitated that the CSR at the desk was on the phone for about 30-45 minutes \\\"checking\\\" on a hotel for me and then came back to inform me that they wouldn't be providing any accommodations since I had a 10 minute window to run through 2 terminals about 1/2 mile with my luggage to the United gate.  The 1/2 mile luggage run through 2 terminals wasn't part of my Crossfit routine and I'm out $80 for my own hotel room.\\n\\nI give you one star, and may God have mercy on your souls.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: So my wife and I met some friends here. We wanted to eat and have a few drinks to celebrate. The waiter must have been new. I asked him about some of the beers they showed on the menu and he was clueless. I asked him about the draft beer and he didnt know what they had. Finally I decided to just have a Coors Light on draft and he brought me a Miller Lite. This was the first mistake. We ordered our food. My friend ordered Fried Chicken and it came out still cold in the middle almost frozen.....WOW. She had to return it and waited an additional 20 minutes while everyone else had there food. My other buddy had Fish & Chips, he said it was fantastic. Then our other friend ordered the steak sandwich and she said it was ok accept she had to pick off the onions that she asked them to hold. My wife and I ordered the sampler. This was NOT impressive. The chicken wings were supposed to be plain and they were spicy. The fingers were hard and way over cooked. The onion rings were great and the potato wedges were the bomb.com. After we at we decided to have a shot of Hennessey to finish off the night and the waited forgot to bring one out so we had to wait again. Yes I am being hard on this place because for such a nice establishment they hired some boneheads to work there. I watched a waitress and a waiter make out were the put in the orders. This is right in front of the customer. No wonder our order wasnt right and they kept forgetting things. The owner should take a long hard look at his or hers staff. At least the cook came out and apologized for the Fried Chicken mishap. Thumbs down to this Steiners due to the lack of professionalism from the staff and the quality of the food.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: I am torn on this late night pizza joint. Great pizza, but absolutely the worst service I have experienced in a long time. Not only was the staff unable to correctly do their job, but they were rude to the customers and to each other. A supervisor ran around the restaurant screaming at customers about last call acting as if his paying customers were nuisances. His staff behind the counter talked about him and the customers while cursing as if no one could hear. After a staff member screwed up my order, she screamed at me that I was to blame and she was too busy to help and it wasn't her problem. Her supervisor did not help the situation. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I am happy that I do not frequent Charlotte enough to be tempted by their great pizza as I refuse to give them another one of my hard earned dollars due to their awful service.

I didn't even know it was BBQ until I saw it on Yelp like a year ago.\\n\\nSo, after moving to the area, hubby and I decided to try it.\\n\\nA very unique place with Thee Pitts Again awards for their bbq is all over the place.  The pink color scheme is interesting and definitely goes with the pig theme.\\n\\nGet the smoked wings appetizer. They are AMAZING. You may want to get the bbq sauce on the side because those things are DRENCHED in the sauce and it kind of takes away from the smokiness of the meat itself.\\n\\n** Note to Celiacs... you may want to hold the sauce... I believe I had a reaction to the bbq sauce... that was the only thing I ate there that I didn't know the ingredients of. \\n\\nHubby had the pulled pork sandwich with fries and I had the brisket sandwich (minus the bread) with grilled veggies.  I also had the Miss Piggy Ice Cream Soda which was AWESOME... altho pricey for what you got.\\n\\nI stole some of hubby's pork and it was very nice... juicy and smoky. I tend to really like fatty pulled pork.\\n\\nThe brisket was ok... pretty dry without the bbq sauce.  The grilled veggies were awesome.\\n\\nOne thing that irked me was that they advertise rattlesnake bbq when it's in season... and I figured, \\\"it's summer... should be in season right?\\\"  Wrong. They don't offer it anymore because someone of some sort of belief that eating rattlesnake was offensive.  I was so irritated with that... why don't the owners just say \\\"Well, don't eat it then\\\"?\\n\\nAll in all... a good place.  I will go back.\n\nStars:",

        "A business built on lies. I showed up at 7:10p on a Friday. The sign outside of the building said they were open until 8p. Their website said they were open until 7:30p. However, the door was locked. All lights and TV were on. So I knocked on the door. As I was knocking, a woman peaked out of one of the windows.  When I saw her, she quickly ducked down. I proceeded to knock. Some guy eventually came to the door. He didn't even unlock it and yelled at me through the glass they were closed. I questioned him on it.  He replied \\\"read the hours on the door.\\\" The door only had the time they opened. I referenced the sign outside and the website. According to both, they should have still been open. He stamped and lied saying the hours had changed.

It was the worst gnocchi I had ever had - very thin and long, it lacked potatoey taste of real gnocchi. There should be disclaimer explaining what cavatelli is, without any link to gnocchi. The amount of sauce was very frugal, so when I was halfway through with my cavatelli, it was all gone. Also, to improve the taste of the sauce, I had to add some butter and parmesan crumbs.\\n\\nGrated parmesan was served in little ramekin which was fresh. Butter came in little plastic single-serve containers you may find in diners but not in fine Italian dining. Also, crackers were single-serve, too; last time I had those when I ordered to go from a deli. Bread was just plain white baguette, no rosemary nor olive oil.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "I happened to be in Henderson for some training for my work.  One of the guys in my class went to Napoli's and got the two slice and soda lunch special for $5.99 yesterday.  I was intrigued so I went today.  I was there looking over the menu for a few minutes before anyone ever acknowledged I was there.  I guess the fact that the restaurant had very few patrons in it at 12:30 PM on a weekday should have been a sign to me this wasn't going to be a great experience.\\n\\nThe girls were on the phone and talking to each other in some European sounding language (maybe Russian).  Once I was finally asked what I wanted, I was rung up and asked if it was here or to go.  I told her \\\"to go\\\".  She then filled up my soda in a glass.  I reminded her it was \\\"to go\\\".  She asked \\\"are you sure?\\\"  I said \\\"yes\\\".  I even checked the receipt to see how she rung me up.  Good thing, too, because I paid her with a $20 and she only gave me change for a $10.  I pointed out that I had given her a $20.  She opened up the cash drawer to check and I guess she saw she had no $10's in the drawer because she then peeled out ten $1 bills and handed them to me.  She told me to drink the soda while I waited for my pizza to cook and she would give me a to go cup.\\n\\nWhile I was waiting, she came by and gave me my \\\"to go\\\" soda cup.  I thanked her.  When my order was ready, she asked me if I wanted more soda.  By this point, I was ready to leave so I told her \\\"no thanks\\\".  As I was leaving, she called me back and asked me if I had only ordered the two slice and soda meal.  I told her \\\"yes\\\".  I wasn't sure where this conversation was going at this point.  Maybe trying to make small talk since they seemed rather cold upon initial contact.  The girls were nice enough to look at, but their customer service skills were VERY lacking.\\n\\nThe slices were huge and the amount of toppings were sufficient, although I have had better pizza.  Don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.  Still seeking that one magical pizza place in the Vegas valley...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

There was no refrigerator, microwave, or breakfast.

        "My home airport, I have originated and terminated quite a few trips and it's given me the opportunity to compare CLT with others. Easy access for picking up and dropping off passengers, we also have relatively cheap covered and uncovered parking.\\n\\nCLT is a great airport if you have a layover. We naturally have the usual complement of Starbucks, but if you're here in the afternoon, make it a point to enjoy one our local Carolina beers. I really like the Carolina Blonde. If you can find one free, take a seat in one of the white rocking chairs where you will find plentiful power and free (and as near as I can tell, unfiltered) Wi-Fi.\\n\\nYou can use any of the security lines because unlike many other airports, once you're through the security, you have access to all concourses - A through E. There are a few slidewalks here and there, but if you have to get from one to another, if you're walking keep an eye out for the electric carts. The higher number E gates are a LONG way from the atrium area. Having had the occasional E32 departure, I wonder why I'm even flying since it seems like I've walked to my destination already!\\n\\nTips:\\n- Rental car franchises are not located in the terminal - you do have to catch your company's shuttle bus. \\n- There's not a smoking lounge inside the secure area. You have to go outside and follow the signs.\\n- The statue outside is Queen Charlotte Mecklenburg, arm extended holding her crown.\\n- There is an \\\"elite\\\" security line at the C security entrance. They are not specific to just US Airways. Any elite passenger is allowed to use it.\\n- CLT doesn't yet have CLEAR or PDA boarding passes.\\n- The ATM fees are steep if it's not your bank!

        "A great hotel!  Very, very, very nice place.  The wife booked via Hotwire for ~$105/ night.  I feel like we got a great deal and were underpaying for the quality this hotel provides.  We were able to check in early without a problem and were given a corner room.  The room was huge....king bed with a sitting chair, sofa and coffee table, and three windows.  The pillows were AWESOME!  We both loved those...it was like sleeping on mashed potatoes (in the best way possible).\\n\\nThe location would be great if you were hitting up a Pens, Pirates, or Steelers game.  There isn't a whole lot in terms of nightlife or eating in the immediate vicinity but there is shopping.  However, there are three dining options in the hotel itself.  If you wanted to walk a bit you can get down to Market square and about a mile or so away is the Strip area which is a pretty cool area.\\n\\nI would HIGHLY recommend this hotel if you can get the Hotwire rate.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nFive girlfriends and I chose this restaurant as the starting point for a \\\"girls night out\\\" mostly because we wanted the view of Mt. Washington and the experience of riding the incline to/from and it was less expensive and more casual than many other restaurants on Grandview Ave. Well, it's true what they say - you get what you pay for. In general, this place seems to be confused about its persona. It kind of WANTS to be a fancy restaurant with the white linen tablecloths and tiny candle lamps on the tables, but there is very little ambiance beyond the view of downtown Pittsburgh. Even the menu is confusing. There seems to be a strange mix of \\\"fancy\\\" dishes and more low-key items such as sandwiches and wraps. The latter would seem appropriate on a lunch menu, but for dinner, I think they should stick to seafood and pasta, and apparently steak, since it's technically a steak house, or at least was in the recent past. (I don't eat steak, so if it was on the menu, I would've skiipped right past it anyway.) The menu was also small - perhaps only 15-20 total choices? Not one person at my table said that they LOVED their meal, leaving me to conclude that they don't really put much effort into their offerings. In my opinion, if you're going to have a limited menu, that's fine - choose a few select dishes and do them REALLY well. A smattering of mediocre choices does not make up for the rest that this place is lacking. Our server was very personable, but I believe overworked, (which is hard to understand, since the place isn't very big), which lead to an overall impression of not-that-great service. We had to wait quite a while for drinks, had to ask for the complimentary bread that we spied on other tables, and had to ask to have our tabletop candle lamp lit at dusk. Turns out, there wasn't even a candle in it - apparently they're just set on the tables for show. He did, however, graciously take back a glass of wine one friend did not like and replaced it with a much better selection. And upon overhearing another...\n\nReview rating:",

        "Century 18 Sam's town is one of the closest theaters to my home aside from Boulder Station's regal theater which is of equal distance. The movies here are sometimes not with Regal and vice versa so either way we're coming here as well.\\n\\nThe Workers here are nice, just wish sometimes they would smile, but i can't really complain, perhaps theyre just sad that day or upset. On Non busy days or during the start of the week, the theater is pretty much dead. Hardly any movie goers, at least during matinee i notice. So everything is clean and everything is neat which is nice. On Fridays or weekends i can see a little more action here, still not too hectic which i like as well.\\n\\nThe auditoriums are clean and well maintained, sound is good, the screens are in ok condition. In a few auditoriums, on the screen, i see lines running from left to right as there's probably a fold or something in the screen. Doesn't get in the way of the movie but you may see it while watching.\\n\\nOverall A-OK not the best theater out there, but somewhere to go. Typical prices on tickets and food, can't complain. Good customer service and well maintained auditoriums. My rating for this place is",

I found her to be very rude, but in a \\\"fake-nice\\\" way.  She kept saying, \\\"but Merry Christmas\\\", talking to me like I was underneath her.  I wish there was a different company to switch too.  I was going to leave NV Republic alone, since even though they switched us from 2 days to one and charge the same amount.   I was ok because they gave us new trash cans.  But now they are missing pickups, and leave the trash can everywhere after pickup.  I am a board member on my association and others have sent in complaints to the HOA.  Now I feel the urge to respond to everything.\\n\\nThis is an add on edit to this review.\\n\\nSo I called Republic Services back and Daylene helped me.  She answered my questions, guided me in the right direction, and solved my problem.  I feel a little torn with a a one star review because Daylene should get 5 start]s herself, but she does not represent the entire company.   Also, Tasha was not good and deserved one star.

We were nervous walking in as we were the only people in the entire restaurant, but slowly more hungry patrons arrived. I ordered eggs benedict & Ryan ordered the biscuits and gravy.

Its located all the way in the far back corner of this huge \\\"Pavilion\\\" shopping center off of South Blvd.  \\n\\nOnce finding it however, I was more than satisfied with the service.  They had enough staff to handle any Memorial Day rush.  \\n\\nThe interior is clean, and the screen are plentiful.  This was the only theater playing Oblivion,  In fact, I have found that this theater plays many movies that other theaters have already stopped showing. \\n\\nIn Summary, AMC Carolina Pavilion 22 is a better than average movie theater.  Friendly service.  Clean.  Plays movies other theaters don't.    \\n\\nPS: Oblivion was better than expected.  Def worth a Red BOX viewing.\nSo I would like to give it",

First of all, I have been a regular customer at this restaurant for nearly 20 years. Sadly, every time I go the experience is worse and worse. I think I'm done. REALLY bad service, coupled with excuses by a young man who claimed he was the manager, who identified himself as \\\"Danny\\\". Well, Danny had nothing but excuses about the INEXCUSABLE bad service, long wait for food, (though they were nearly empty) and his feeble attempt at trying to make it our problem, only made matters worse. The understaffing is not the concern of the customer, \\\"Danny\\\" and is completely a management problem. In all reality I thought he was the dishwasher. Nothing about this young man says management, and nothing about this restaurant says, \\\"we want your business!\\\". It's too bad. This used to be a great place to dine.

        "Review text:\nLOVE Chompie's!!! Probably one of my favorite places in Scottsdale for casual eating.  My friend and I go every Saturday mornings after hiking with the dogs. Obviously since we bring the pups we sit outside. I have to say, I am shocked at reading about the terrible service. In the three years I have gone here at least once a week, we have never had terrible service. There is one waiter who I don't think likes serving the patio people (or maybe it's just us dog people) but everyone else is amazing. We're barely there for 5 min and they are out with water bowls for the dogs, coffee for me, and a diet coke for my friend. \\n\\nOn to the food. It's thanks to Man vs Food, and my mom, that I found Chompie's. She had seen the episode and since I was moving to Phoenix, she wanted to try. Now every time she visits we have to go at least twice. She has gotten everything from french toast to reubens to chicken and waffles --  and she's loved it all. Her favorites are the sandwiches because they are enough food for 1-2 more meals!! Having celiac's disease, I have to go with what's on the GF menu, but I still love it. My go-to is the GD Bagel w/lox platter. It is so yummy and filling. The rare times I don't get that, I will get the reuben or GF waffles. The pups always get their plate of bacon.\\n\\nChompie's is now carrying a variety of GF deserts and pastries, which I love!! My non-gf friend and I will occasionally split a chocolate and peanut butter brownie. I'm lucky I have the dog or I would go in before I left and buy more for home.\\n\\nWell that it is. We'll be at Chompie's with the danes tomorrow for our post hike brunch like we are every weekend!\n\nReview rating:",

The pieces of fish topping them were also large which required quite the mouth calisthenics to maneuver them (especially the more chewy pieces like the octopus).  I say make the pieces smaller so they're easier to eat and add another one to the platter to make up for the lost volume.  The rice was appropriately sticky but flavorless and a the temperature wasn't quite right.

No seriously, when you walk in there is a huge bushel of peanuts, and you can get as much as you want! Done with the shells? Just leave them on the table then brush them aside. The end result? A restaurant with peanut shells all over the place. Actually, to be quite honest, I'm being a little harsh here. I thought it was cool that they did this unlimited free peanuts thing, but it was like they were trying to compensate for something else.\\n\\nWell, when I got my food I figured out what they were trying to compensate for. The salad and 'breadsticks' were just plain bad. However, I didn't really expect much. I was actually hoping my wings would be good and that the salad was just a side. The wings are nothing special at all. I thought the 'El Hefe' wings were somewhat decent, but I don't think I could have more than a half-dozen of those. Hot wings? What hot wings? I thought I ordered some, but maybe the waiter got confused. I got some cold wings with red sauce on them, they tasted 'vinegary' and that's about all.\\n\\nTo be fair, the service was pretty good and the server was friendly. She was helping us make decisions since it was our first time, but the food was cold on multiple occasions. A previous reviewer mentioned gorgeous staff... Not quite sure why you would prefer that instead of good food, go to a strip club? Maybe if the food was hot it could be different, but I really doubt it since the recipes here are just way off the mark.\\n\\nThere is really nothing special about this place. The wings are over priced for what you get, and there is better stuff available 5 minutes away from here. I love wings, and I've been trying so hard to find a good wing place in Phoenix, but I think my search continues for the time being.\n\nReview rating:",

She WAS going to get a better tip, but changed my mind when I found that I was charged for that service.\\n\\nI don't plan to return here and one star only due to this shady practice. Otherwise it's an ok place for a cut, just be sure and tell them you don't want extra stuff if you're not planning to pay for it.\\n\\nMy wife was waiting for me while I was getting my haircut and after we left, I found out that most of the magazines available for reading while you wait were playboys. In my opinion, a reputable business should NOT keep this type of material around. Then again, I wouldnt really consider this a reputable business.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Was referred here by my orthopedic surgeon.  Suppose to have an appointment with Kayla.  Was running late for my first appointment, so I called to see if I should still come in or reschedule.  They told me to come in, so I estimated 15 minutes late and arrived 25 minutes late due to Tempe art festival traffic.  Upon arrival I was told (albeit politely), that I would have to reschedule.  Total time spent for me driving back and forth one hour and no rehab :( Pretty bummed because I was really looking forward to getting started... I'm an an ER doc in the area, so with my random schedule it's tough to find good times to come in.

        "Went here for my fiancee's birthday dinner recently!  I was so excited to give this place a try.  Locally owned, right down the street and somewhere we had never been before!  When we got there, the waitress seated us at a table near a window.  There were only about 10-12 tables in the whole restaurant and I was actually surprised at how many people there were.  It happened to be 1/2 off bottles of wine night so we ordered one of those.  There were two servers both of whom were very sweet and accommodating. \\n\\nWe started with a featured watermelon and arugula salad, which was really good.  For dinner, I had the steak and my fiancee had the featured dish (a grouper with a saffron couscous i believe).  The first time my steak was over cooked, but they fixed it and sent back out a better medium rare.  Everything had a good flavor, but what was the most disappointing was the prices for this type of food.  We spent 100 dollars on a bottle of wine, a featured fish dish, one salad, and a steak.  If it had been a filet or some other cut of beef, it would have been a little more reasonable to ask people to pay 24 dollars, but this was an 8 ounce skirt steak.  I just don't see the value in that.  If this were a little more reasonably priced, this would be somewhere we would frequent a lot.  I think they also get most of their vegetables from the farmers market across the street, which is nice.  \\n\\nIt was just a bit disappointing.  For the price, there are plenty more locally owned places with the similar feel to them. My rating for this place is",

        "I would not recommend this location.  We ordered our food ahead of time and gave them a specific time of when it needed to deliver it by.  It took over an hour to get it.  First, they got our address wrong when we told them no more than 5 times.  Second, it was very difficult to get a hold of them.  It took about 5 tries for them to finally answer their phones.  They claimed that the driver wouldn't answer their phone.  They brought up someone else's order.  My manager had to drive down there and see what the issue was and our food was still at the restaurant waiting to be picked up and he made sure that they threw it away and had them make it again.  I was on the phone with an employee while my manager was on the way and she asked me to give the driver another 10 minutes  and all I could tell her was that we've been waiting for almost an hour, why?  If any of you want to go to a Schlotzsky's, don't go to the Southern location.  You will get bad service, you won't be able to get through 5 calls later and they'll put you on hold and forget you are there\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I usually am pleased by The Cheesecake Factory but this time I will say it was a horrible experience. First off it was my mistake going on a friday night and waiting 30min to get seated but then after being seated it took another 20min just for someone to come and ask if there was anything that we wanted to drink. Finally after ordering it took forever to get the food AND it was the complete wrong appetizer, not once but twice. Usually when you receive your food asa common curtesy your asked if everything looks alright or how it is. Well not once were we asked. Lets just say the service was beyond awful.\\n\\nThe drinks, well i can say that the drinks are always good, this time i ordered the green tea which was great and it was delicious. The food on the other hand was not so enjoyable. I ordered the stuffed tortilla which was not a stuffed tortilla, it was more like a quesadilla thrown together with an odd tasting corn patty. Not a fan. My issue about cheecake's food is just that they can't decide what they want to serve. There is just too much variety which means there is a great selection but the food is just bland.\\n\\nOverall, my recent trip was a bad experience due to the service and the bland food. The Cheesecake factory is a good place to go with a group of people that cant decide what they want to eat but otherwise if you really want great food i wouldn't recommend The Cheesecake Factory.\nSo I would like to give it",

We actually scored a groupon so we figured we'd risk it and we were so glad they did. We have been spoiled by many an independent pancake restaurant here in San Diego - but we are still huge fans of original house of pancakes! We loved everything about breakfast - it was delicious, hot, and surprisingly didn't take that long to come out even though they were slammed. (Saturday morning at 10:30 - it's really annoying watching people complain about the wait. Don't be surprised!) I'm obsessed with their cheesy potatoes - yummmm. I had chocolate chip pancakes and my husband had an omelet and we split both. I'm also a fan of their coffee and my cup never once was missing fresh brew (and I'm a fast coffee drinker!) for the families - this is a great place to go.

I went to the counter and the salesperson was on the phone, so I waited patiently for a few minutes and when I got the sense that she wasn't going to finish her call anytime soon I decided to go elsewhere.  She told me to wait and I told her it was OK, I had waited long enough and would come back another time.  She ended her call and hollered at me from the counter.  That was just odd because this isn't a place that usually yells for customers to come back.

This isn't exactly what I would call the normal business lunch locale; you don't come here for the ambiance. The food is served on styrofoam and paper plates, and the table service doesn't exist. I definitely don't suggest taking your special lady here on a date night.\\n\\nWith ala-cart tacos and burritos ranging from a couple $ through six or seven, this place is easy on the wallet. This is exactly what I was looking for and I savored every last bite of my Machaca (aka: beef) burrito, and taco! That was one great meal. Now I can scurry back to my mid-town office and finish up the day in style. Carolina's claims the valley's best tortillas; which can be ordered by the dozen and taken home, and you won't hear any disagreements from me. The fresh made tortillas are super thin, tasty, and never seem to break when you eat them, like many others will do.\\n\\nHappy Yelping Phoenix, Carolina's serves up some mean Mexican delights!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nHands down, best sushi in the city.  I think this is both if you are a roll person or if you are a sashimi person - which is not the case everywhere.  Some places make awesome rolls, but that seems to be to hide the not-freshness of the fish.  Others have great fresh fish, but can't make a roll to save their lives.\\n\\nThis place does it all.  J and I went here on a Friday night around 6 and were sat immediately - no wait, but the place was pretty packed.  I started with some hot sake and a green salad.  Their ginger dressing is delish!  I was practically licking the bowl.  I considered asking for more lettuce to soak up the rest of the dressing when our shrimp shumai came.  J and I try to get shrimp shumai everywhere we go as a barometer and this was by far the best.  The wrappings were complete and held in all the very fresh shrimp goodness.  Then came the sushi.  We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop.  What can I say, we like sushi.  The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy.  The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here.  However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna.  Everyone does a spicy tuna.  At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around.  Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna.  No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it.  The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome.  One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll.  Both excellent.  \\n\\nWhile I do also love me some Katana in Dormont, this place has the best sushi in the city and in a charming location in downtown Mt Lebanon.\n\nStars:",

        "As far as a variety of Vietnamese restaurants to choose from in North Scottsdale, there is none.  Just the fact that this place exists where it does warrants at least 1-star!\\n\\nI've been here a few times and it is always good.  The menu is not very big...but everything I've had is always good.  It always bothers me though that they don't call their pho by its real name, or their sandwiches as banh mi.  But oh well, this is NoSco...have to cater to culturally inept folks.  I've had their beef pho, and it was decent.  Nothing to rave about from what I remember, but it definitely works.  I'll need to try it again to give a full report.  Recently I just tried their #7 \\\"Marinated Beef Sandwich\\\" (Banh Mi)...and it was delicious.  Thinly sliced, marinated pieces of beef (grilled), with lettuce, cilantro, shredded carrots, cucumbers, and a yummy mayo sauce.  I'm not as well versed with Banh Mi as I am with pho (im a \\\"pho-natic\\\" lol), but as far as my taste buds could tell....the sandwich was darn yummy. \\n\\nThe owners are always there and as others have said, are super nice.  Although I don't find it to be the most authentic Vietnamese place, definitely stop by this place if you enjoy Vietnamese food and need your quick fix. My rating for this place is",

        "After moving from Los Angeles to Las Vegas I called LVRJ to start a delivery subscription.  It has been almost 20 days since my initial call (and 2 subsequent calls to the Newspaper) and I have yet still to receive a copy of the paper.  Both calls resulted in the same result.  They indicated that since I am in a brand new community the paper needed to be sent to the routing department because they were unable to find my address.  I guess no one in my community receives a newspaper.  I just wonder how it is that everything else I needed to be delivered to my residence has found its way here and in a timely fashion.  When I was in Los Angeles I ordered a subscription to the LA Times and the first delivery was made the next day.    I now depend on CNN and the internet for the news. Because of their incompetency  I wouldn't accept a subscription now if they offered it free. My rating for this place is",

        "Sows of all ethnicities are welcome at China One!\\n\\nChina One is a massive Mongolian-Chinese buffet. The restaurant is never too full, in a great location, features reasonable prices and most of the offerings tempt repeatedly. \\n\\nThere are a couple of issues, though. The service is pedestrian and too carefree; the servers are space cadets and rarely present timely. Drink plenty of fluids ... then drink more ... the food is liberally laced of delicious MSG. As expected, the sushi is old and a health risk with every swallow greatly increases.\\n\\nThe review reads a little negative, but China One is a sensational guilty pleasure for its price. If you see me at the buffet line, though ... step aside and give respects.\nSo I would like to give it",

You can pick up brochures to join the local chapter of Amnesty International, New Times, and see an age range from parents with kids, to groups of older men meeting for coffee and breakfast, to college kids with their books.\\n\\nI also appreciate establishments that don't play canned Clear Channel or satellite radio and allow the staff to choose the music. When I was there Sunday they were playing \\\"The Queen Is Dead\\\" from The Smiths. You certainly wouldn't hear that at Einstein's.\\n\\nMy favorite breakfast bagel sandwich is the \\\"August 22, 1988\\\" for $4.99 (Chili Tapin Sauce, Egg, Sausage, & Pepper Jack Cheese). It's named after the day the Phoenix Cardinals made their debut. (I had assumed that was the hottest recorded day in Phoenix, but was incorrect).  The Chili sauce definitely gives it a swift kick to your tongue. A great breakfast bagel sandwich for that enjoy it on the spicy side.\\n\\nThey have your basic fare as well, and lunch sandwiches and salads.\\n\\nI want to also agree with Alexandra K. and cheer for the salt bagel.

        "Mercury was a summer staple for me years ago, mostly because the bartender never once charged me for a drink. We also worked out a deal on their near-empty 80s nights with DJ McFly: you give us $2 PBR tallboys and rails, we'll pack your bar weekly. It worked out for the best - the Merc actually made money and we had a weekly dance party that we didn't have to clean up after. \\n\\nIn the seven or so years that have passed, Mercury has gone downhill (or, realistically, stopped offering the perks on the side that made it worthwhile). On a recent visit, the only people at the bar on a Friday night were our friends - all there to hear our friend DJ. I do love they have an ample back patio (something I don't remember from years back), and the drinks are apparently still cheap (I don't know for sure, I only had one and a friend purchased it), so it's not a total loss, and if they keep letting our friend DJ I'll probably be back. \\n\\nIf I do go back, though, I'll have to remember to stash a roll of toilet paper in my purse, as they were completely out of paper products. No TP, no towels, no napkins. How you don't keep a stockpile in back, I don't know. Even if your regular delivery falls through, you'd think for a Friday someone would have run up the block to Walgreens to buy a few rolls or at the very least asked a neighboring restaurant to help out. \\n\\nAlso, friends, keep an eye out when coming in from the patio - the back step tilts downward and slippery shoes or a drunk gait might send you tumbling.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: Shmeh.  Pita Jungle (pronounced hoon-glay...kidding, not really) is an area standard in many respects, but when looked at objectively, it's kind of a mish mosh.  And a mediocre one at that.  Don't get me wrong - the food isn't bad.  It's just that if you are jonesing for anything Mediterranean, this is not your place.  The menu is loosely inspired by mid east cuisine, but really, it's more of an upscale, continental restaurant with hummus barely wafting through the air.  Chicken in any form is well-seasoned and moist, baba ghanoush is toothsome, as is hummus, though not better than Trader Joe's, sadly.  Taboule used poorly chopped curly parsley (really, that stuff should be reserved for garnishes and nothing else - flat parsley is the way to go) and was a little underdressed.  Hubby's salmon was fishy and tasted like it hadn't been seasoned.  Underwhelming all in all.\\n\\nThat all being said, with the lake view, well-appointed decor, modern art slicked walls, live music and potent drinks, this place is more of a spot for sipping and nibbling than tucking into generous plates of mideast fare.  Maybe they should call it the Pita Lounge (minus the pita).\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

After all, I have been eating your food for as long as I can remember (at least 20 years).  I'm very fond of the memories I have with you.  However, Enzo's, if you are rude to me or my husband, one more time, I will probably never come back ever again.  I understand that there may be an east meets west kind of out-of-syncness with our communication, I get it.  I really do.  But you complained about us, in front of us, because we didn't give you the coupon at the exact time when you preferred it.  Never mind that I have been coming here for 20 years or that we simply didn't know.  You don't make eye contact, you don't say hello or thank you.  When I ask a question, the answer is half-assed and un-helpful.  \\n\\nEnzo's, your food is terrific.  The value is terrific.  I hold sentimental value in your establishment.  But your service of late, steals every bit of pleasure from our meals.  It tarnishes the memories.  It makes the food taste bitter.  \\n\\nI really don't want to break up with you Enzo's, but in case you didn't know there are a lot of new players in the locally-owned delicious Italian food genre.  Some might even have better food than yours.  If you were nice to me, I wouldn't even think about it.

        "Review text:\nSo these guys have been here forever I heard. After coming here, WHY is my question.\\n\\nFirst of all, I was looking for a chicken combo meal. You know, a couple pieces of chicken, fries, and a drink. Let's see.......you can have a sandwich combo, a chicken finger combo, and a clucketo combo. They have a chicken combo but it does not come with a drink. That's not really a combo dude! \\n\\nSo after looking around the place, I noticed everybody that was eating didn't have any actual chicken on their plates. All I saw were chicken fingers, sandwiches, and clucketos (chicken taquitos). As if that wasn't enough of  a clue that the chicken wasn't good. \\n\\nSo I opted for the Gobbler Combo, which is a turkey sandwich. The turkey itself is a breaded patty and deep fried. They give you a small package of mayo to flavor it, which I thought sorely needed it. The fries it came with were dry and covered with a lot of salt. Sadly, it could not save those poor potato sticks. \\n\\nAfter forcing myself to eat the turkey sandwich, against my better judgement, I actually wanted to try their chicken so I got a leg and a wing. Might as well have been a piece of rubber and styrofoam. \\n\\nService was mysteriously fast. After further observation, it looks like they cook everything in advance and put it under warmers. I know this because not one second has passed since I hand over my debit card, they have one of the cooks handing me the two pieces of cardboard......err I mean chicken in a bag. I literally saw him pulling the chicken out of the warmer. \\n\\nSo after taking a bite which should have been a nibble, I was afraid it was gonna bite me back. I would not give this stuff to a starving homeless person. That would be considered an insult. \\n\\nSo to the reader, please, PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE. To the owner, since you have been there forever, I assume you got nothing to worry about since you got some people to actually come back and eat here.\n\nStars:",

Good chunks of chicken and several big shrimp.  Tons of crunchy bean sprouts and cabbage.  I'm hoping for the same thing next time :-)\n\nReview rating:",

You took us to Rosati's, and we were delighted with everything:  the waitress, the coziness, the friendly customers there with us; and, of, course, the deep dish Chicago pan pizza.

We attempted to go here for dinner TWICE and they had closed early...The 3rd time was a charm, but the place itself is NOT!. They had live music, a Mexican Group playing cha-cha music, which was horribly loud! The Chips were stale, & the salsa wasn't really salsa...it was more like hot sauce. I ordered the Albongdigous (Meatball) Soup...It was lukewarm at best. The Chimichunga was just okay... Jim's tacos were too spicy for him...  Baja Fresh is way better than this place!...just sayin'.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I'm on what feels like a never ending search for a groomer that can cut my dog's hair and feel like I've gotten close with Shelly's Pet Grooming. I took Baxter in with a jacked up (and grown out) hair cut he got from Bark N' Babies and asked that they just do whatever they could with him. I pretty much left it in the very nice groomer's hands and said go as short as you have to. The shop is clean and everyone else seemed to be pretty friendly, so I left him with fingers crossed! The groomer did a really good job and definitely went short, but I was completely okay with it! Sometimes you just have to start over. The pricing was decent and I walked away feeling pretty good about the experience - not to mention that my little guy smelled amazing! Since he has longer hair, I'd be interested to see what they're able to do when I don't want him to get a military cut! I definitely think Shelly's is worth another try! My rating for this place is",

        "Review: I woke up to an 85 degree house. My AC had stopped blowing cold air. After doing a quick search on yelp, I choose Dekes by rating. The dispatcher sent someone by a couple hours after my call.\\n\\nThe AC was diagnosed with a broken compressor and I was given an option of repair for $2400 or a new unit for $3000. The man was quick and matter-of-fact, which did not add to my skepticism. When I declined the repairs, he informed me I would be billed $85 for the less than 5 minute visit. Observing the AC afterwards, he left the cover unscrewed as well.\\n\\nAnd that's the reason for my rating. If I had known I would have to pay $85 for the visit, I would not have requested their services. How else does a customer make an educated purchase on repairs if quotes must be paid for? If a company wants to bill for diagnoses and travel time, it ought to be stated during the initial request.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

It's a cute little place in downtown Chandler, and on the weekends they have a jazz band in the breezeway.  I always go for way to much wine and the Nosh Plate - a mix of cheeses, olives, bread, and CHOCOLATE!  Yum!  A great place to relax with girlfriends or go on a date.  Haven't had dinner here, so I can't speak on that, but love the inexpensive wine and always end up taking a couple bottles home.  \\n\\nOh yes, and you should check them out in a couple weeks for the Kokopelli Krush - a grape crushing contest with prizes!

        "I really like Port of Subs sandwiches.  I usually get #6-vegetarian.  You have a choice of three cheeses, but I always get triple Provolone. The bread they bake tastes really good and doesn't flake when I eat, unlike another major sandwich chain.  It's not dry either and I don't feel like I need to wash the particles down with a drink. \\n\\nPort of Subs is right down the street from where I work, which is perfect because they are quick and always have a smile.  Employees are always helpful and help me out when I make a lunch run for the office.  I always ask if I can hand them the post-its of orders and not once have they rolled their eyes.  They take them all, stick them on the counter and begin making the sandwiches.  When they're done, they will mark the wrapper with an initial or something for easy identifying. \\n\\nI just love coming here. Sandwiches are made tasty by friendly employees.  Plus, coupons arrive in the mail frequently and I can use my student ID at this location to get a small combo for $5.49.  Not bad for a student on a budget!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nThis location of Starbucks let me down yesterday. It was 11am. I had met my sister here before we headed out on the town for the day. I was hungry for a breakfast sandwich or hot sandwich from the fridge that they will heat in the over for you. They were out of almost all flavors of sandwiches, they had only 3 left. They were also out of all breakfast sandwiches including the turkey bacon with egg, I understand that it was 11am but still, most Starbucks have these sandwiches well into the afternoon hours. \\n\\nI decided to try the faijita chicken sandwich with pepper jack from the refrigerated section at the counter. The cashier was very rude about the lack of sandwiches in the first place. She got irritated that I asked if they had a ham and swiss sandwich when it wasn't out. Anyhow, she heated up the sandwich and wrapped it up for me. The chicken was disgusting and I pulled a couple of pieces out and they had black spots on them. I am not sure how long that particular sandwich had been sitting out but eww.\\n\\nI did also have a passion tea and it was delicious as usual. Rule of thumb, come here only for drinks, avoid the food at this location. I would only come back for coffee or tea. Customer service was also not the greatest.\n\nStars:",

The cashiers especially are rude and condescending.  I always cash my checks at station casinos, then gamble a little and have a free beer, but never at this one. I was in the area today and had a paycheck to cash and went to cash it. The cashier told me my ID was expired (by 5 days) so I produced a sheriffs card photo ID, that would not do, niether would my state issued guard card photo ID, my company credit card with both my name and the company name....they would not cash my check.

        "Will never be back and will tell everyone I know how terrible and unsafe this place is! Today at 2 pm, John at the beginning of the line took forever to get to me - checking in 3 other people who arrived after me.  Then he asks if I wand the floors and mats cleaned and I said yes if it was fast - I asked him 3 times and told him very clearly that it had to be done fast since I had another appointment.  \\\"Yes, yes, fast, I know\\\" is what he said.  50 minutes later I asked another guy to check on my car and he comes back to tell me it will be another 45 minutes!  That guy was really nice but I was now very late for another appointment.  I watched 3 of them gather at my car, stop work and just start talking.  I waited 7 minutes to see if they would start again and finally walked over to the car to see what was going on.  Those folks were very nice but then John walked up and told me that it was my fault because my carpets were so dirty and that he never made any promises to me.  I disagreed and did raise my voice, but never yelled, when I said, \\\"oh so this is my fault?\\\" He immediately took a step closer, got in my face screaming at me not to yell at him and that I \\\"disrespected\\\" him all while pointing his finger less than inch from my face. I told him, very quietly and very sternly to \\\"Walk away John, Walk away now\\\" and he just kept going, backing me up until another very nice worker stepped in and had to physically push him away from me. FYI, I am a woman and I was alone today.  I can't remember the nice guy's name as I was pretty shaken at this point but he had a black bow tie on and he was great, apologizing and trying to make it right.  I told him that at this point i didn't feel safe staying there and to just give me my car.  It took forever since their spin dryer for the mats wasn't working and I drove home with sopping wet mats in the back of my car and quite upset.

        "I WOULD RATHER EAT OUT OF THE GARBAGE ... than eat at Cafe Luna again.\\n\\nThe day we went they had a set menu for $45 a person. 4 courses. Without exaggeration, THE FOOD WAS DISGUSTING. This was my first time here, so I didn't know what to expect. The restaurant looked nice, good atmosphere. The service was fine.\\n\\nFIRST COURSE: Lox with cream spread and bread and Oysters\\nThe salmon tasted like it was two weeks old. It had that rancid fish smell you get when you buy old discount fish from meijer. The oysters were the same. Terrible.\\n\\nSECOND COURSE: Coconut Shrimp and Mixed greens with beets\\nThe Coconut Shrimp tasted like it came straight from the buffet line at a cheap Chinese restaurant. Cheap quality. I wouldn't be surprised if it came from some frozen bag at costco. Mixed greens with beets was pretty good. \\n\\nTHIRD COURSE: New York Strip Steak and Lamp Chops\\nI swear on my life this is the worst steak I've ever had. The meat was tough and stringy. It was WAY over-seasoned. And it was like 50% tough, inedible fat. I could make a better steak when I was 12. The Lamb Chops were so tough, we couldn't even eat them. \\n\\nDESSERT: Berry pastry, flourless chocolate cake, and some shitty marshmallow thing covered in chocolate and coconut\\nWhat can I say? Dessert was the best part of the meal. And it was still awful. The pastry was fine. Nice and flaky. However, the flourless chocolate cake (portion was the size of my thumb) was subpar, and the marshmallow dessert tasted like sugared tar. It was impossible to chew.\\n\\nDropped $120 with tip (two people) for the worst food I've ever had at a respectable looking restaurant. I understand it was a set menu day and their tapas are better. However, what self-respecting chef/cook serves food this low-quality to anyone on anyday? I enjoy good food, but I'm definitely no snob. This was just unacceptable.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I suggested possibly the waiter could question the manager to possibly extend the policy to 10 people who just arrived and were going to order dinner - the manager approved some special pricing which we have yet to determine.  \\nDinners arrived  a little more then 1 hour after ordering.  The restaurant was not full and no one was waiting for a table when we arrived or left.  One asked if there would be some bread - as he is a diabetic and needed some food - we were told it came from a \\\"different window\\\", but the waiter would see we got some.  After several suggestions before and during the meal - it never arrived.  Refills on iced tea and water were rare at best - my iced tea, after requests, was filled at the end of the meal.  Then the waiter, after questioning us several times as to whether we were happy and all was well, came to the table, obviously at managements insistence, and gave us nothing more then a spiel on joining some sort of club for $25, for which we would after buying meals get a free one or some sort.  \\nI, very nicely, informed the waiter I would assume the over 1 hour wait for meals was not his fault and that management had a lot of nerve to now request possibly joining a \\\"club\\\".  Very nicely I informed him I could only speak for myself, but I would never return and would write this review.  The food was OK -nothing special, but the service was just not there.\\nThe management, or lack thereof is in trouble if this service and attitude were to continue.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

They got me sick a bunch of times.Poor employee treatment. They don't pay for MANDATORY meetings. I got written up for not attending a meeting. Also, make you wait for ever to clock in.

WIFI, power strips everywhere, lots of seating available.\\n\\nIf you like a nice ambience while working/studying this is the place. I love the collection of eclectic tables, chairs and booths in this space. This place is great for people-watching also. They have a few boardgames on a shelf near the bar. \\n\\nThe workers usually play their own music, which works for me most of the time, but oh my goodness I went there one night where they were blasting Beyonce and Britney Spears. I should have said something, but I tweeted my disdain instead...\\n\\nI love getting the vegan soups there. So tasty and comes with yummy pieces of bread. It feels better since they give you so much in huge pretty bowls that also heighten the experience.\\n\\nTheir sandwiches are huge and filled with lots of veggies.\\n\\nThey make great flavoured drinks such as the mayan mocha (spicy cinnamon mocha). AND they use Monin brand syrup which is a huge plus for me because I do not like Torani and DaVinci is the worst. That's my personal preference.\\n\\nThis place has the best soy mochas in my opinion. The mixture of the intelligentsia espresso and soy makes a great nutty combination.\\n\\nI almost forgot! They serve a mean affogato! Espresso, icecream, whipped cream, those tasty small almond cookies. I wish places here would do it like caffe paradiso instead of just giving me gelato and espresso.\\n\\nThe pastries from mirabelle's are amazing. I recommend the alligator and bear claw. So soft and fresh.\n\nReview rating:",

        "My husband and I ate here during our recent trip to Vegas.  We were staying in the hotel and were given a coupon when we checked in.  There was a pretty big selection of foods available however none of it tasted very fresh.  The ribs were too tough to chew, the egg rolls were mushy and lacked any actual meat inside, the pastas were over cooked , and the black forest cake was the worst I have ever eaten.  Our server seemed out of it, she couldn't seem to remember our drink orders even though we were just a table of two and there were only 4 or 5 other tables seated in her section, and come on its a buffet so bringing the drinks is about the only thing they have to do.  The only thing I really did like were the pot stickers- I have a soft spot for pot stickers.  Overall I've had worse but I've definitely had better too, much better.  I probably won't return.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Went there for lunch on 9/6/2013.  When we walked in the man at the front desk seemed uninterested and told us to seat ourselves.  We started to settle into a spot but got interrupted by a waitress who then seated us. Make up your mind people.  Menus came fast but without a drink order, we were both very thirsty as it was over 100 out side.  We also had to wait a bit long for the food order.  The staff seemed to pointedly ignore us and walk past our table again and again.  Our waitress eventually came to check on us but was so intent on speedily asking a quick question she started to walk away without a drink order again, we had to stop her.  \\n\\nFood came promptly, with our drinks, but it tasted so so at best, about take out quality.  We chugged through the waters and soda very quick but the empty glasses sat at the edge of the table until we finally had to hold up an empty glass and yell over for someone to bring refills. Rude yes, but nothing else got any kind of attention.  \\n\\nAfter we were done, yep you guessed it, waited forever for the check.  No excuse for a place with people at only 10% of the tables.\\n\\nAnother big issue:  They have a yelp coupon for checking in, even though it was presented at time of ordering, they WOULD NOT HONOR IT!!\\n\\nBad service, so so food and dishonest representation.  And we had been trying to get there for a long time.   At least it was cheap.\\n\\nUpdate:  We were contacted by the manager regarding the coupon not being honored.  They said it was only for the dinner service.  Problem is, the coupon did NOT state that.  This makes it false advertising and constitutes fraud in my book.  Its called \\\"bait and switch\\\" draw them in with a false ad.  That only makes me feel worse about this place, can I take the one star back?\nSo I would like to give it",

Aaaand left a tad disappointed. The only thing fresh we received was the bread (oh, soo good), the maduros, the guanabana shakes and the avocado salad. Our main course came so fast out of the kitchen after we sat down and ordered, we were amazed... Until I stuck my fork into my chicken fricas\\u00e9 (spoiler alert: when I get it at my local spot, the meat is falls-off-the-bone delish!), not only did it not budge off the bone, it tasted like it had been re-heated, and parts of it had the texture of jerky. Not a sign of freshness. Lord knows I've cooked and reheated enough leftover meals in my day to know what happens to chicken when reheated in the microwave. My mom's meal, though it was very tasty, the one bite I had was less than lukewarm. All of these elements going downhill were disappointing, because of our waitress being so friendly and welcoming that it felt like I was coming to my family's house to eat. Though everything else was great, the two stars are strictly based on the main course.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review: Hand Sanitizer on every table- Nice!\\n\\nThis place is small -I hope you enjoy rubbing elbows with the next table. Despite the close quarters, this restaurant offers quality Thai food at reasonable prices. They feature lunch specials that include a delicious soup, egg roll, white rice, and your choice of entree. I chose the chili mint with sliced chicken (Level 5). The soup was fantastic! At first glance it looked like a bunch of celery in a clear broth that I wasn't excited to try. But of nowhere, it smacks you with complex flavors that will make your head spin. Wait, was that a spicy bite I just had? Hah, what was that crunch? AMAZING!\\n\\nMy only small complaint was that the chicken was a little overdone, as well as the rice. Have you ever eaten burnt rice that was stuck to the bottom of the rice cooker? Yeah-- that! However, the flavor combination that the chicken chili mint had was so good and spiced perfectly. Finally -a restaurant that doesn't skimp on ingredients. I would definitely come back -at a less busy time so I don't have to have the guy next to me breathing on me. Good thing the hand sanitizer was close by.......\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

He got me through a very rough first pregnancy and is getting me through another. (Note to self... No more babies!) Dr Martin is also very excellent. He actually delivered my son because Dr Swainston was out of town when my blood pressure spiked. Dr Swainston and Dr Martin both knew of my wavering blood pressure before I ended up having to go to the hospital so nothing was a surprise to Dr Martin when it came time to deliver. They communicate and work together very well. Jane, the nurse practitioner is great when neither doctor is available.  She is very knowledgeable and caring. She has always taken the time to sit and answer any questions. And regardless of when I pop in there, she always seems to know who I am and what my condition is. The nursing staff is also good. They will take time to answer questions and try to understand the situation. In any case, I haven't had a bad visit in the six years that I've been there.

        "To me steak is steak, but this place was a step above.  My husband is the beef aficionado.  I often order the salmon at steak places.  I did however choose steak being as most of the reviews mentioned steak.  They did have a Bison special for the evening but I am not really a fan of bison either.  It also sold out about 30 minutes into dinner service (we got there for early dinner) so if you like bison I would suggest calling ahead.  As a starter, they brought out an array of bread, long bread stick, whole grain loaf and some type of biscuit.  And lovely little crudites in an ice filled glass.  We started with wedge salad that had an very nice strong blue cheese dressing.  My husband ordered the New York strip and I ordered the 8 oz filet both excellent.  I was pleasantly surprised when the vegetables come out properly cooked at a steak place.  We also splurged on a bottle of wine, which the server suggested.  Also delicious!  We could only partially blame the wine for the fact that we left there full and happy.  We want to go back for the after 10pm special and of course the desert we didn't room for.  Definitely on our list of restaurants to return to.\nSo I would like to give it",

I had never tried this type of cake before, so I have nothing to compare it to, BUT is was a huge success. You can call in a special order, or like me, you can just show up and purchase one of their bundt cakes, as is. One thing that I wish I had known before hand is that they have mini bundt cakes that cost around 4 bucks each. I almost wish I had bought several of the minis, that way we could've tried multiple flavors, such as carrot, pineapple upside down, the red velvet, some sort of white cake as well as a chocolate cake.\\n\\nAs it were, the birthday girl served up slices of the Red Velvet cake to friends and everyone loved it. One even exclaimed that it was the best ever. I will purchase cakes from here every single time there is a need, or even when there is not a need but we're craving some yummy cake.\n\nStars:",

It wasn't a terrible experience, but judging from many of the other reviews here, I expected better.\\n\\n**Update** So I gave the place a 2nd try (orange chicken) a few months ago which didn't turn out to be that bad, not great, but not bad.  I went there again today, ordered the szechuan chicken and was very dissapointed.  Yet again, supposed to be spicy, yet just tasted like MSG gravy, no flavor, no spice, just umami and cornstarch.  \\n\\nI'm guessing that there are probably dishes that aren't bad, but so far, all I've gotten was bland.

I know this is a hassle for the server - as she got the orders technically correct and all the seperate checks were accurate, I will say our server, Juanita, was completely acceptable.  I would say I prefer my servers to have all their key teeth - but that's just snobby and irrelevant to the service, so I'll let it go.\\n\\nFood - the value here would be great for a steakhouse - if it was good. \\nThe zucchini app for the table was A-OK.  It's a mountain of sliced breaded and fried zuc - and it was fried right and served piping hot.\\nThe salad dressings threw me off a bit.  No regular Italian or Balsamic Vinaigrette - but a RASPBERRY vinaigrette?  At a value steakhouse?  The French dressing is a CINNAMON French.  Not bad...but I'm not a fan of dessert flavored iceberg lettuce. :)\\nFor entree, I chose the ribeye with baked potato.  The potato was fine.  I wish I could say the same about the meat - but I still can't figure out how they managed to make a rib eye tasteless.  It was on the rare side of the medium rare I ordered - and with that much fat, it should have been delicious. But, no.  Not a morsel of flavor to be found in the whole 12oz serving.  (Half was consumed for next day lunch - the extra aging didn't help. :)  In fact - my dog wasn't even impressed.)\\nNothing wrong with the corn on the cob - as long as it's cooked I think that's hard to mess up.  \\nI am guessing the baked beans were ok  - some people must like the cloyingly sweet 3 parts brown sugar to 1 part bean recipe.  Personally, I am not a fan, so I didn't enjoy them.\\n\\nThe decor is cowboy steakhouse.  Very similar to any other cowboy steakhouse.

I ordered the greek salad with falafal ($10) and my boyfriend ordered a gyro lunch special ($10). The falafal balls were simply not good. They were dry & dense and lacked the crispy on the outside/soft on the inside freshness of good falafal balls. The salad itself was really small - I expect a larger portion size for a $10 salad. I will say the feta on top of the salad was quite good but there were only 3 small slices. My boyfriend thought his gyro was average and that the greek place down the street (taste of greek) made a better one. The french fries were good, but that is not so hard to do. All the seating is indoors which really is a shame in a place with good weather. Overall, I wouldn't come back here to eat again because there are lots of other choices nearby.\n\nReview rating:",

I'm not saying it's a terrible place but rather a relic from the past.\\n\\nThe place always seems crowded. When we visited, we found faster seats at the bar where we ordered food.

I did observe some strange situations like a middle aged couple on a date getting a nice view of the people waiting's midsections.\\n\\nAs far as the food goods, I won't go back.  I compared my meal to a drunk, late-night visit to Denny's in college. I wasn't impressed by the fish fry.

The sungold tomatoes associated with the summer squash risotto were the stars of the dish - luckily the server was able to provide the name of the local farm that sells these on the square for the farmer's market (not naming the farm as my parents wants these sungold tomatoes). My girlfriend had the Roasted Branzino despite her worries of it being too heavy.  The Branzino was cooked perfectly and not overly heavy for a hot summer day.  As it was a hot day, I went with the Braised Monkfish.  The dish was excellent but it was unsuspectingly heavy. In general the portions were huge for a French restaurant and the prices were not too bad (especially since we had been in NYC for dinners recently).

Again, only two of each....as in two ribs with a little bit of meat on them, and two pieces of shrimp!  I'm not a \\\"cheap\\\" eater, but for $30, I would sure hope for more food than that.  I mean two pieces of a sushi roll? give me a break!  I know this choice is under \\\"appetizer\\\", but in today's food world, that doesn't mean \\\"miniature\\\"...especially for the price. (funny they don't mention \\\"2 of each\\\" on the menu)\\n\\nThe main course was a hanger steak that was cooked nicely with..wait for it, four pieces of sweet potato wedges...small wedges.  No veggies, nothing substantial.\\n\\nI guess what I'm getting to is this:  Why does it seem like Roy's rations food to an apocalyptic portion?  Is the world out of shrimp, rice or chicken?  Has supply and demand multiplied a hundredfold?  Sure seems that way when dining at Roy's!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "I hate to say it, but every so often I get a Pixie craving that just won't quit, and if I'm in Metcalfe's grabbing groceries, forget about it! I will most certainly get a quick fix if I'm already there. And I realize admitting this for all the world to see means admitting that I walk past Madison's most loved chocolatiers celebrated and stocked by Metcalfe's in exchange for some sub par Pixies that came off a truck, but I'm ok with that. Have you had one? \\n\\nWhen I was little I used to do clothing shopping at Golf Mill mall with my mom and if I made it through the day without completely melting down at the fact that she had to buy me husky pants (god what I wouldn't do for a little elastic waistband these days) I could pick out a treat at Fannie May. \\n\\nIronic? \\n\\nThey had this weird nutty, chocolaty marshmallow thing I liked simply because of it's size, but the Pixie was my jam. Now back then before I new what good chocolate tasted like, milk chocolate calmed my urge. These days, dark is where it's at. \\n\\nAlthough they wanted to make their new retail space at Hilldale fancier than it should be, it's not like gourmet chocolatiers are working round the clock to bring you crafted delights, the space is pretty sharp; Crisp, clean and bright white with traditional red accents. It reminds me of what my childhood visits used to be like, but instead of husky pants with elastic waistbands, I'm there shopping for kale and quinoa.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nWe went to Top Shelf because we had a coupon from our Entertainment book for a buy one, get one free entree.  When we got to the restaurant, we hung out in the waiting area for a few minutes before the hostess came to seat us, but we enjoyed looking at the fish tank while we waited.  Our waitress was nice and kept our drinks filled and the food was pretty good, but maybe a little pricey for the portions.  When the bill came, we gave the waitress our coupon.  She brought back the bill and our kid's meal was the one given to us free.  When we asked, she said she tried to give us the second adult entree as the free meal, but the manager wouldn't let her.  She then had the manager come talk to us, but he wouldn't budge on the matter.  I have never been to a restaurant that considers a kid's meal to be an entree.  It seems this company is more concerned with making a couple bucks than good service that brings back return customers.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

We got a monster table all to ourselves.  Nice.  Even nicer was the view of downtown.\\n\\nBJ got a Penn Wheatson beer.  It was very good, simliar to a Blue Moon or a Hoeggarten.  Since we were feeling a little German, BJ got the pierogi plate and I got k\\u00e4sesp\\u00e4tzle.  We liked both our dishes.  My accompanying salad had some brown pieces of lettuce.

He seemed like he didn't want to be there. His bad mood started to make me get into a bad mood. My boyfriend had mentioned to him that it was my birthday and he didn't even ask if I wanted anyone to sing and bring out a dessert. He didn't say anything about it. No happy birthday. Nothing about out costumes. We actually had another sever come up to us and talk to us about our costumes and was super friendly. I wish I had gotten his name and I wish we had him as a server. \\n\\nMy food was ok. My boyfriend said his pizza was terrible. \\n\\nOverall last night was a horrible experience.

        "Came here for lunch today (it's my burfday) and for once in his life My T. did not argue with me where to eat!!!  \\n\\nEverything looked good on the menu, so I asked the waiter for suggestions.  Right off the bat he mentioned the tuna carpaccio (off menu item).  So we ordered that, mussels made with white wine, a side of meatballs, and a large house salad (rasberry vinaigrette).  Tuna carpaccio and meatball stood out.  Tuna was spread very thin over a large plate.  Served with capers, egg bits, and drizzled with wasabi and a soy sauce.  The bites had a little kick, but I would definitely tell everyone to try this.  The meatball side were two baseball sized meatballs served in their marinara. (I know, baseball doesn't sound appealing, does it?  But it's a perfect size description, so get the thought of sweaty baseball players out of your head, and think of the meatball again.  It was an  excellent meatball, moist and filling.  The house salad had Gorgonzola and apple with their homemade dressing.  Nice light addition to the meal.  Mussels (you have a choice of what kind of wine you want them to make it with).  Also excellent, we were full, we didn't need to get this last dish. We were struggling by the end of the meal.\\n\\nYes, I agree, the prices are a little more than you would get at Denny's, but it's not thaaaaaaaat expensive.  Salads were around 10 dollars.  All the sandwiches on the menu are 10 dollars.  The apps range 10-15 dollars.  Burger is 12 dollars.  Pizzas are 20 dollars.  Tiffanie R I have no clue how you racked up a $200 bill!!! \\n\\nPlace has a very cool, winery vibe.  Dimly lit.  Waiters are all very attentive yet relaxed.  The place is packed (business crowd, perhaps there was one hipster?).  \\n\\nI would try this place out, it's a little gem on this side of town.  BTW the place smells amazing when you walk in, you will get instantly hungry. My rating for this place is",

        "Review: Went here with a friend the other night. Decided to sit in the dining room because I haven't seen it before. Someone brought us waters but no one greeted us for at least 5 minutes, so we decided to move down to the bar downstairs. It was only a couple minutes before happy hour ended and the bartender threw in some food and drinks for us which we were delighted by. But the rest of the visit was less than pleasing. Both of the bartenders were detached and not warm, or welcoming. I honestly felt like we were a burden (although there were only three other people at the bar) it felt like we were getting the cold shoulder. The guy bartender did not smile once. Let alone make eye contact.\\nFOOD: the oysters were more disappointing. They were not shucked whatsoever and they were too large, and did not taste fresh. I let them know and they were taken from me but without apology or any action taken to remedy the situation besides taking half of the order off of the bill. \\nNeedless to say we decided not to order anything else, the uncomfortable visit went on long enough. \\nI'm extremely disheartened by this and when before I would recommend this place to friends, I will not be returning and I will not subject others to this.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The service was very good as well. It was pretty late, but you didn't get the sense from the servers that they just wanted to get out of there.

        "what i love are the sales at this place outside.\\n\\n\\nOne lady was very helpful but when you have a specific answer it almost seems like they don't know about what they have had in inventory or just don't want to take the time and help you or have any fashion sense to tell you what their opinion is.  So that said i obviously didn't buy as much as i could have which is good and bad. good for me bad for them.  Also bad for them because my review could have been better if they seemed more helpful with the situation and at the end of my sale i had picked out myself with no help towards the end and had my merchandise rang up and they don't offer their loyalty card or email services. I know most people don't like to be emailed but you control what goes into your inbox and i love deals so if they have better deals on more stuff sign me up! so i had to ask to be apart of it. Not used to someone not asking.\\n\\nGlad with my sale purchases not to fond of the service.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nOur two-night stay at the Shadyside Inn involved three suites and was like a god damn roller coaster ride.\\n\\nFirst of all, it's a bizarre concept with a bizarre aesthetic. Our suite was essentially a small apartment in a decrepit, tacky building across the street from the main facility. After somehow making it up the steepest driveway of all time, and somehow stumbling across our rooms in the completely unmarked hallways, we actually found that they were quite nice looking.  Felt very much like college dorm rooms - but they were serviceable and clean.\\n\\nToo clean - it turns out. After we had barely settled in, my cousin came running into our room screaming like a banshee holding out hands covered in soap. \\\"IT'S NOT COMING OFF! IT WON'T COME OFF!\\\" Turns out every single piece of brown furniture in all of our suites was covered with furniture polish that stained our clothes and stuck on our hands.\\n\\nWe called the office, and were put on hold for ten minutes.  Finally went over across the street, and the staff ended up being very gracious. Apologized profusely, offered to pay to have our clothes cleaned, and removed the guilty furniture from our rooms. Everyone received an apology letter explaining the oversight. We received special attention as the first guests to fall prey to this cruel trick, and received a handwritten apology from the management and two bottles of cheap merlot.\\n\\nEverything else went smoothly until check-out day. We were heading to a college graduation ceremony and intended to drive, but were forced to walk due to the Pittsburgh Marathon route.  When we called the office to ask if it were okay for us to leave our luggage in our rooms until slightly after check out time (HALF AN HOUR ONLY), they flat out refused to allow it.\\n\\nAfter shit-fits were thrown and our varnish-debacle resurrected, they allowed us to leave our cars in the lot with the luggage in the trunks, which they initially tried to refuse permission for us to do.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we did not leave happy campers.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nArizona is known for it's amazing foodie gems you can't find anywhere else.\\n\\nPoncho's is, sadly, not one of them.\\n\\nWait! Hear me out. Before you ignore this review, understand that Arizona stands alone when it comes to Mexican food. Having eaten everywhere for Mexican food in both California and New Mexico, I can say that AZ's authenticity and flavor are incomparable. So naturally you would want to make the most of your dining experiences in Arizona and eat at places that have plates that leave a lasting impression on your palette.\\n\\nAlthough Poncho's may have a quaint history you want to root for, it doesn't mean that their cooking skills are the kind you want to spend a good amount for. Just because someone says they're Mexican or have a Mexican background does NOT mean that they automatically have the correct method of seasoning, prepping, or even frying.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I wanted a Sunday lunch there, and we were going in with an open mind. I was actually excited that I would finally try the \\\"pollo fundido\\\" that everyone talked about. We left a little disappointed.\\n\\nThe human traffic in the dining area is distracting. The setup of tables is a little weird, and although the warm paintings of desert landscape are inviting, the constant movement of waitresses, busboys, and families is...well, annoying. Then the food came. It was very, very, VERY inauthentic. The salsa for the chips was literally a tomato paste that resembled something like ketchup with some spices thrown into it. The meal was heavy; it was greasy and felt more like a fast food combo that wouldn't keep me full for too long. Great meals leave you satisfied, but here I couldn't eat much. I looked around and noticed that the crowd that ate at this place really didn't care if the food was bland or nothing close to the beautiful mom and pop shops that would put the food to shame. It was saddening and a little frustrating to know that they were missing out. \\n\\n\\\"Can I be honest with you?\\\" My boyfriend asked. \\n\\\"I could get something...\n\nReview rating:",

There sandwiches are amazing, its not about the bread, its not about the toppings, its about the meat. And to me that's what makes a great deli sandwich is the meat. Everything I have ordered here is amazing and worth it. From the kielbasa, smoked bacon, and the pork franks, you cant go wrong with what you order. Their deli meat prices are slightly cheaper than your average Boars Head meats you find at the store and are one hundred times better. So grab some cash, stop in ,you will be greeted with a friendly smile and you will be a customer for life, just like me.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nThis place was one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area when I lived there.  If you like REAL Korean food and good Sushi at very reasonable prices, you should definitely check it out.\\n\\nI've been there dozens of times and their dishes are very consistent.  Their staff is very friendly and it is always fun when they recognize me and welcome my girlfriend and I by name each time.\\n\\nThey usually have one or two servers, which can be rough during rushes, but its not too bad if you're not rushed or anal about service the way a corporate secret shopper would be at a chain restaurant.\\n\\nMy favorite dishes there are the Kalbi, Sam Kyup Sal, and Bulkogi.  I get one of these most of the time, but their Bibim Bop and Fish dishes are great too.  Some people who aren't used to true asian cuisine with bone-in fish, strong spicy flavors, or bitter Kimchee might be taken off guard by some dishes here, but if you have an open mind and a strong stomach, you'll love it.  My girlfriend usually orders the Bibim Bop or Bulkogi and loves their rice and says its the best she's had at a restaurant that wasn't $100+ for the two of us.  Make sure you come with an appetite!\\n\\nTheir sushi is excellent.  The flavors are great and fresh and just as good as Ra Sushi without the price gouging.  They don't have as much Flashy presentation as them of course.  Our favorite sushi roll they have is called \\\"Dirt in Ocean\\\".  Make sure you try the orange sauce that it comes with.\\n\\nMy girlfriend loves their Green Tea, iced or hot and I always order a tall Asahi or Sapporo with our meal.  Both beverages compliment the dishes well.  Their Plum Wine is good too, but its stronger than the wine we have here in the States, so don't guzzle it.\\n\\nThey recently added Karaoke rooms which I look forward to trying when I fly back down there this weekend!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

There was a sign that said clearance . I asked the sales person how much it would be for this small couch. I ended up waiting forever to have my question answered. About 45 min or so. She finally comes out and tells me what the price was. It' was a reasonable price. Then I noticed there was a black stain on the seat of the couch. It's pretty noticeable when sitting on the couch.  I pointed it out and said to the sales person what I had found. No comment coming from her. She just stares at it. I asked the sales person if there is another couch for sale or not for sale. There was none left in that style that I liked. I was surprised that they would have a dirty stained couch on their floor. I left and went else where. I hope they change managers there.

I love love love pot stickers!, I buy them at any Asian joint I go to, make them at home.. I have DREAMS of gyoza dipping itself in fresh ponzu sauce and feeding itself to me, because I love them so much! (well, maybe not that far, but almost.) However, this is the first time I have eaten what equates to a Gag Rubber Gyoza.. =( It was sadness for the tummy. I couldn't even pawn off the rubbery \\\"treats\\\" to my German Shepard. She just sniffed it and gave me the stink eye like I was trying to poison her with them. \\n\\nCustomer Service:  I have said this before and I will stand by it every time; I don't expect 5 star service from a fast food joint. I understand these are minimum wage employees who more than likely die a little inside every time the put their uniform on in the morning.  I get that this job will not be the one they fondly remember as \\\"the good ole days\\\". That being said, don't make me feel that way too please! I don't want to feel like the life is being sucked out of me because of the Eeyore atmosphere. \\n\\nPrice: WOW, I remember when it was actually cheap to eat here. For 2 people, with 2 item combos, and portions smaller than they used to be, it came to more than $18! I could have gone to one of those mom and pop Chinese shops, got the lunch special with soup, egg roll, and bigger entree portions for less. And the food didnt even taste fresh. It definitely was NOT worth the cost and lack of atmosphere.\n\nReview rating:",

Prescription Drop-Off = No problem. 15 minute wait? I can swing that. What's another tick, tick, tick of the clock as my head throb, throb, throbs. \\n\\nI mosey around the aisles. Nice. Latex gloves on sale - 3 boxes for $10. Oh, look, espresso chocolate. \\n\\nTick, tick, tick. \\n\\n45 minutes later without my name called over the loudspeaker (bummer), I head to the Pick-Up. I'm anxious for my meds. It's been a long day anyway, and this is the final stop. Or so I thought. \\n\\nI take a seat and stare at the floor. After all, the overhead lights hurt my eyes. I glance up and the pharmacist smiles at me. That's pleasant. I continue to wait.\\n\\n\\\"What's the name?\\\" I answer her. \\n\\nThat's when I hear they have 3/4 of my prescription ready but that one drug (my drug of choice to tackle the migraine) is out of stock. Would it be okay if I waited until Monday? \\n\\nUhmmm... \\n\\nMy mind flashes back to another Walgreens on another day when I'm waiting - in agony, mind you, after oral surgery. I want my narcotics like the children of rock wanted their MTV. I was told they were out, and I'd have to wait... or take my carcass to another pharmacy. I opted for the latter, for the claw marks in my palms were evidence enough that I couldn't stomach this pain any longer. \\n\\nSo, needless to say, when I was told by this particular Walgreens that they were out of my gonna-make-your-boo boo-all-better meds, I had an emotional hiccup. WHAT? \\n\\nCount up the minutes. One hour in this stinkin' Walgreens and I'm really no better off than when my peds walked through the front door. Double ugh.

The salsa was just as good as it was before but the cheese enchiladas were disappointing. The original Don Jose's cheese enchiladas were the BEST in the Valley. When I ordered a Togo for my husband I was told that they weren't doing \\\"To Go's\\\" yet and I would have to put it in the Styrofoam Togo box MYSELF. Yikes! The owner maybe didn't think that there was a liability to his customers by doing that themselves as the plates were steaming hot and I could have burned myself! I scooped the food from the STEAMING plate being very careful not to burn myself. BAD IDEA! \\n\\nAnd then there was yesterday. We attempted to go again with some friends of the family. We all \\\"grew up\\\" with Don Jose (including my Mom who ate there once a week when she worked at Anita's back in the day) and thought this would be a great restaurant to meet at. My sister, daughter & I were 45 minutes early to the restaurant . To our SHOCK the owner would not allow us to be seated because our \\\"party\\\" was not all there. There would be 7 of us and he would not hear of it! Hum...there were two big tables sitting there empty. I told the owner that were were tired (just having finished the Willo Home Tour in downtown Phoenix and saving our appetite for Don Jose's) and would be ordering our drinks and a cheese crisp to hold us over until the rest of the girls came. Nope...would not let us be seated and were told \\\"that we had to think of him!\\\" \\n\\nWe then went outside and called the rest of our party and told them that the NEW OWNER would not let us sit down 45 minutes early so we would be going to \\\"Manuel's\\\" on 28th Street & Indian School to meet. There we WERE SEATED, spent $85 for the 7 of us PLUS $20 for additional takeout. Sorry NEW OWNER...you missed out on our patronage yesterday and forever!

        "Review: I'm not inclined to waste time crafting a cleverly worded review for such a subpar experience, so I'll just bullet point it out after a little background. \\n\\nI remember going to the GC as a kid/teenager for special events that called for a special, grand space and fancy food. The GC back then did an admirable job of accomplishing that. The main dining room (once the passenger terminal for the old PA and Lake Erie RR) is a spectacular, inspiring environment, and the food, if a bit stuffy, was well executed and fresh.The other night was a sad reminder that things change, often not for the better. Thusly:\\n\\n1. Upon being seated a member of our party found a bunch of dirty cloth napkins _underneath_ the table. After asking the hostess what we should do with them we were met with something along the lines of \\\"Well, I can't reach them so what would you like me to do?\\\". This resulted in said party member handing the soiled linen to said hostess and quickly excusing herself to disinfect her hands. \\n\\n2. We ordered a bottle of wine and the clearly inexperienced server didn't pour an even volume into all of glasses to the members of our party who were partaking. When we politely asked about this he said that if there's not an equal volume for the final glass then there's just not an equal volume for the final glass. As this is total hogwash we asked to speak to a manager who came over and provided a replacement glass of wine. \\n\\n3. After the \\\"wine incident\\\" the waiter was visibly passive aggressive in his interactions with the table. It went so far as that when he'd walk away from our table, members of our party could see him shaking his head on multiple occasions. We were nothing but civilized following his mistake and this was obviously an amateur and immature reaction to not owning up to a simple mistake.\\n\\n4. I had the salmon Rockefeller. It was barely edible. The fish was cooked dry and was not hot. I take that back, it was at precisely the temperature that a piece of fish would be at after sitting under...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Where to start with this \\\"gem\\\" of a dive bar. \\n\\nParking: This can be a risky situation depending on the level of love you have for your vehicle of choice, which I have none. There is no parking lot per se. There is a small lot adjacent to the music venue next door. Other than that, you are on your own on either Grand Ave or whatever the closest side street is. On said side street appears to be some sort of mechanic/junkyard/chop shop. So if your car goes missing after being at the Bikini, look there first. \\n\\nThe scene: I don't recall there being any windows in this fine establishment. This always leads me to the conclusion that they don't want people to see the inside until they are already in. The booths feel like they may fall apart at any second while you are sitting on them. The cushioning is nonexistent in them. Probably wore out some time during the Carter administration. They do have a pool table, but I am not sure there were any balls or sticks. So do the math.   Oh yeah, just check out the ceiling when you go and ask yourself if it is up to code or not.\\n\\nThe bartenders: On the particular night I was there, the two female bartenders may or may not have had a full set of teeth between them. They both appeared to be in their early to late sixties and one or both may have done some hard time. \\n\\nWith all of that being said. The beer is cheap. I have turned down my nose to Budweiser for a while now, but enjoyed a mini-pitcher of it recently. I mean $3 for a pitcher really can't be beat. If a friend should drag you here, go, if just for the experience and the street cred you will garner for saying you went to the Bikini Lounge one night... And survived!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Staff was very friendly and pleasant except when we tried to order something to eat at the end of our round.  It was 15 minutes before they closed the kitchen and I had just walked on to the patio seeing the waiter leaving a table of 4 men after taking their order.  I called out to the waiter so that  I  could get some menu's to order.  He put a menu down on the table and asked what I wanted and I said\\\" can I have a couple of minutes to look at the menu\\\"?  He said \\\"no, I have to take your order right now because the kitchen is closing\\\". I asked him\\\" didn't you just take an order from that table of four over there\\\".  He said yes, but the kitchen is closing.  It wasn't 5:00 yet and I was shocked that he wouldn't give me just a minute to look at it.  I believe they should allow you to order up until closing.  I feel the management needs to overhaul their food servers!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Oh Los Faves, you sure know how to make a great breakfast burrito. What I love about Los Faves is that their burritos are not greasy, and they offer them with either flour or whole wheat tortilla. I'm boring with my order and usually get a sausage burrito, and sometimes a quesadilla. Their quesadilla is made with American cheese and not with queso blanco. On weekend mornings, expect a long wait with orders (around 15-20 minutes) since they get really busy. It's a good place to get a nice warm burrito and do yourself a favor and ask for the salsa verde, it gives the right kick to deliciousness!\nSo I would like to give it",

They advertise their salmon as King Salomon but it really just tastes like raw canned salmon. As I'm a big fan of good Salmon, this will stop me from ever going back.\\n\\nService has gotten pretty bad also. The new waitress they have was about absent minded as can be.\\n\\nThe only things I still like at Shimogamo are the live sweet shrimp (ama ebi) and Sea urchin (Uni) but on the live sweet shrimp they have gotten very stingy as they only give you one head and they split the body in 2 pieces.\\n\\nThe establishment stank like rotten cabbage and I've noticed it being not well maintained behind the sushi bar.

        "I can't speak highly enough about the staff at Riviera Opticare.\\n\\nMy wife and I both set appointments for our annual eye exam the day prior to our actual visit. Upon entering the showroom, we were greeted by all of the staff who weren't currently working with other patients...and THEN the receptionist greeted us.\\n\\nThe exam itself was a typical eye exam. The doctor was, much like the rest of the staff we had met up to that point, extremely polite. Since my wife and I both had appointments at the same time, the doctor was kind enough to allow my daughter to come into the exam room with me. \\n\\nAfter the exam, my wife and I were faced with the daunting task of picking out frames. To put this mildly, my wife and I are...let's just say that we're \\\"particular\\\" about our glasses. Colleen was exceptionally patient with each of us, as we sifted through the myriad of frames they had to offer us. \\n\\nOnce we finally picked the frames, Colleen was fantastic. She crunched the numbers to determine which option worked the best with our insurance. It's always nice when someone goes out of their way to SAVE you money.\\n\\nColleen informed us that our glasses would most likely be available within two weeks. Much to our surprise, all three pairs of our glasses (one pair of prescription sunglasses and two regular pairs) were ready in 6 calendar days!\\n\\nOnce we came in to pick up our glasses, the fantastic customer service picked up where it left off.\\n\\nTo save time, my wife and I each sat with different people to ensure that our glasses were to our liking. My wife sat with Colleen, and I sat with Cami.  As I mentioned before, my wife and I tend to be \\\"particular\\\" about our glasses. Both Colleen and Cami were exceptionally patient with us, adjusting our respective glasses accordingly to guarantee that our glasses fit JUST right.\\n\\nAll in all, my family couldn't be more pleased with the service we received from Riviera Opticare. If we still live in this area when our next annual eye exam comes up, you can rest assured...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nDragon Palace has become my new go-to Chinese place. After having brought home dinner from here several times, Hubby and I decided to eat in last night. It was a totally solid meal once again. \\n\\nThe egg drop soup is like no other I have ever had- thick, savory, and eggy, with small squares of tofu and red bell pepper. I am normally repulsed by anything with bell pepper, but this stuff is so delicious, I can totally overlook it. This time, I decided to try the won ton soup, and it, too, was awesome- savory and full of perfectly cooked won tons with little nuggets of pork inside, topped with green onions. Delicious. \\n\\nWe also got the crab puffs- again, these are some of the best I've had in Phoenix. They also have regular and vegetarian egg rolls. I don't think the latter are on the menu, but just ask for them. They are pretty good. \\n\\nI have had the house special chicken, the sweet and sour pork (minus the bell pepper, of course), and the three seas (scallops, shrimp, and chicken with snow peas and bamboo in a light sauce). All are very good, very generously portioned, and almost entirely meat. The scallops in particular were so well cooked, and next time I go I will have a scallop dish. Hubby has had three types of vegetarian entrees- the family bean curd, the veggie and egg crepes, and the mushrooms, peas, and bamboo combo- and he has enjoyed them all. \\n\\nThey do not deliver, but do a brisk takeout business. While we were dining, they had someone picking something up every few minutes. They are super fast with the takeout, even with special requests. You will wait only 10 minutes and have everything well packaged and ready for transport. Everything is still hot when I get home, even after more than half an hour drive. \\n\\nDragon Palace does not have everything on the menu that I would want in my ideal Chinese restaurant, but it comes close. Everything we have eaten has been good at the very least, and often among the best we've had in the Phoenix metro, and the prices are very reasonable.\n\nStars:",

        "Review: I asked a friend of mine if she had a good dermatologist, and she goes to Camelback Derm.  I made an appointment (dealing with mild acne), and was optimistic for some new treatment as well as to get a prescription for a topical I had already been using.  I knew going into it I would be seeing a PA first and then meet the doctor.  I made it clear on both the written forms they have you fill out as a new patient and verbally stated to the PA that I have an autoimmune disorder and cannot take certain medications with antibiotics.  I met the doctor for only 5 minutes.  i was still given a prescription for a topical with an antibiotic in it and when i got home, after doing more research, it was highly suggested on many websites (including the drug company's) to not use this medication because of my autoimmune disorder.  This was the first frustrating issue.  I called the doctors office and left a message with the nurse's line, and they did call back pretty quickly saying they would change the prescription.  While it was nice that the doctor gave me samples and coupons for the prescriptions, one of them was expired, and could not use it at the pharmacy (though I did end up later finding one online through the drug company).  I also found that frustrating-but only because it costed me an extra half an hour of going back and forth to the pharmacy.  Overall, I felt most bothered by the fact that I expressed more than once that I have this pre-existing condition that should be taken into consideration, and the neither the PA nor the doctors seemed to take notice.  I do understand that this doctors office is very large and busy, but being that I was a new patient to the office, I felt very rushed.  But, this office location is very convenient to where I live, and for the most part do not have many other skin problems to deal with, so I don't plan on having to go to this office very often, other than to follow up on my progress with these medications.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Came here of my Birthday dinner with my girlfriend. I haven't been here since probably they opened way back in the day. It is one of my girlfriends favorite places and after the first place we were going to go to was full of obnoxious drunk people I decided we should come over here after hearing her talk about it. It turned out to be a great decision.\\nThere was a 20 minute wait when we arrived but that was not a big deal and not to bad for a Saturday night at a place at a mall. We put in our name and we were given a buzzer so we waited. The hostess even used my name when we came back in when the buzzer went off. Not a big deal but a nice touch. Most places ask for a name and never use it. The place was pretty busy but still not too loud. We got a nice booth and started to look over the menu. They had a lot of stuff that looked good. My girlfriend advised against any pasta dishes as she felt they didn't measure up. Of course she is part Italian so she is going to be a touch critic on Italian dishes. I saw the double cheese burger and my eyes lit up. Can't pass that up. Well it turned out to be a good and bad thing. That burger was HUGE but so good. Big patties, bacon, cheese and everything else. Cooked just how I wanted it. Very good. As got the spicy potato wedges, another tip from the girlfriend, they were delicious. Good thing I was hungry from swimming most of the day but I still couldn't quite finish it. Also I was saving some room for a Pizookie. Which I had never had and my girlfriend never goes to BJs without getting one.\\nI ordered the triple chocolate one and even though there was a little bit of a wait for it, they don't make it until you order it, it was so worth the wait. So ooey and gooey and good. I will definitely be having one too every time we come back here.\\nOverall, I really liked this place. Maybe won't get such a huge burger next time but I will be back.

        "Today we decided to go to the Good Egg for brunch. Haven't been in years and today it reminded me as to why. v\\n\\nI want to make sure that this isn't a reflection on our waitress. She was very pleasant and tried to make it better, but couldn't because of the kitchen and the guy manager.\\n\\nToday we ordered omelets which come with potatoes and a muffin. \\n\\nFirst the omelet. Supposedly made with fresh eggs. LIE! They clearly use liquid eggs (most likely  with citric acid added to maintain freshness It affected the texture and loft of the eggs when they cook). They omelet was paper thin, rubbery, and the texture was off. For $9 bucks, one expects real eggs. Not that rubbery mess they call an omelet.\\n\\nThen we come to the potatoes. Served cold and a few were even frozen. Yes FROZEN. My friend's potatoes were cold and some were frozen, too. So we nicely mentioned to the waitress who informed us that had happened a few times today. She promptly returned (about 30 seconds) with supposedly fresh cooked potatoes. LIE! No way can you cook country style potatoes that fast. It's physically impossible. Same freakin thing... Some where cold and a few were still frozen while others were pipping hot. Which tells me they mix frozen in with hot to bring them up to temp to serve them. Have they not read the current food code? Temp Control!. \\n\\nOur waitress nicely apologized and said hat she said something to the manager on duty.  But at no time did a manager come over and say anything to us. We were then told how they have two pans of potatoes. One defrosting and the other on the cook top heating. We were actually told that sometimes when the cooks are in a hurry the scoop up the wrong ones... Really? Well I think that's another issue with how they defrost frozen foods. \\n\\nWe then head to the register to to pay the bill (28 bucks).\\n\\n2.50 for a diet coke (really?)\\n2.95 for supposedly fresh squeezed orange juice (that's lie)\\n2.25 for a cup of coffee (really? this isn't starbucks)\\n8.50 for my omelet\\n9.00 for my friend's...\nSo I would like to give it",

Was asked at the door if my husband and I were celebrating anything and I said yes little early 10 year anniversary and didn't even get a congrats or happy early anniv. Then the waitress we had seemed to be in a hurry and kind of impatient with getting our order and drinks. The water is terrible and didn't even get a lemon when asked for the first time when she took or drink order. Then we get a hamburger and well....... we asked for med/med rare and we got rare....it was so much grease/juice coming out of the burger that the bottom bun was soaked and was not able to eat it.  Small amount of blue cheese.  This is the first place that we meet on a set up blind date and needless to say we won't be coming back.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "I feel a little bit weird about giving a sub-par rating.  I'm not much of a seafood fan, so my opinions might not be too strongly formed.  Though, it seems plenty of other folks have given this place less than stellar reviews.\\n\\nI ordered a \\\"New Orleans Pot\\\" or something like that.  The menu described it as shrimp and sausage with some spicy cajun seasoning.  Turns out it had crawfish too, but maybe I just didn't notice.  The sausage was just one link and a bit bland.  In fact, the shrimp was bland too.  The waitress \\\"warned me\\\" it would be spicy, but after removing the shrimp shell the shrimp tasted like regular ordinary shrimp.  The shrimp was a bit mushy too, is it supposed to be like that (like I said, I'm not a seafood expert)?\\n\\nThe pot meal came with corn on the cob.  I asked the waitress to substitute with a side of steamed broccoli.  She said that wouldn't be a problem.  I suppose she forgot (it happens, not *that* big of a deal).  Problem is, she seemed to have quite a few memory problems as she also forgot to bring out my friend's side salad.\\n\\nAlso, the food was really slow to come out.  The restaurant was practically empty.  It felt like it took forever.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Granted, it was Wednesday, but it's hard to imagine how this place can stay in business. \\n\\nIt was a bit awkward because there was no music playing, so I felt compelled to play something on the jukebox. Any new songs were two credits ($1) so that kind of sucked, luckily I'm a fan of 90's music...\\n\\nThe bartender (yes, the very same that cut me off previously) was actually really sweet this time, so that definitely warrants a star increase.\\n\\nIt's still the only bar that I know of that is cash only, which is pretty inconvenient. \\n\\nIt was a lot better this time, but this place is still boring and doesn't really have much to offer.

        "I do not live in the area so when I found myself getting my hair done right up the road, I was unsure where to go. One of the girls at the salon suggested Phat Burrito and being the burrito lover that I am, was really excited. I walked in and was not too impressed. The menu was poorly displayed and I really didn't like the fact that I couldn't see what came on each burrito. I ordered the fish burrito with tallapia. I got my burrito, which was huge and took a bite. I was starving so I was excited to eat something that I usually get a lot of satisfaction out of. I immediately tasted this disgusting sweet mango salsa. I was really confused because when the person who took my order went through the toppings, he never mentioned this concoction. I really do not like mangos and tried to open the burrito up and eat it with a fork, that didn't help. Overall, I was not satisfied with my $10 purchase. I was really disappointed and my lunch date who ordered a chicken burrito shared my sentiments. I might go back and try something else but probably not by choice.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

We had to turn around, go back to complain and the girl that took our order tells us that she only charged us for one, then if the fact that they charge a \\\"convince\\\" fee for using a card isn't bad enough, they want to charge us it again when they inconvenienced me. I mean, come on... Take an accurate order. Do your job! Plus she went and got the owner and he was a jerk. Talking over us and arguing with us. They have lost my business.

Well, it must not have been *too* full, as we were immediately seated. But it certainly felt jammed. That was probably due to the fact that they crammed about 500 tables in the space the size of a Starbucks. To boot, those table were stocked with crying babies. Lots of crying babies.\\n\\nI felt kind of bad for our server, who was a big girl. She could barely get through the back to back chairs in order to reach our table. However, during the course of dinner, my sympathy waned, as I realized she sucked as a server. I can't stand having to look at empty dirty plates, and we had to do that a lot. I was also thirsty a lot. \\n\\nNow the food... wow, the food. OK, it started well enough, kind of. First, we got a really yummy loaf of rosemary-laced bread, served with EVOO and cracked pepper. That's it. No balsamic or herbs or salt. That would've been fine, if they olive oil was fantastic. But it wasn't.\\n\\nThe blah oil set the tone for the rest of the meal. Blah, blah, blah. The only flavor in any dish, was a hint of butter. Everything was dreadfully underseasoned. My lobster ravioli primarily tasted of the spinach pasta that surrounded it. It could've really used some garlic, salt, and some herbs. \\n\\nThe whole meal was completely underwhelming, and I was resentful for having spent *any* money on it. Damn you, gift card.\n\nStars:",

I enjoyed the chicken satay appetizer and the nice drink/wine list,  along with the modern,  relaxed atmosphere.  Really like sitting on the patio or in the bar area.  However,  the main dishes are mediocre at best. I always give places a second shot but our second visit was even more underwhelming.  I had the sea bass and my husband had the pork tenderloin.  Both were prepared well but pretty much tasteless and boring.  And expensive.  I love good food and I'll pay for anything worth it,  however this sea bass was not a $26 dish.  Not on any planet.

Yes please, and thank you.\\n\\nHidden in the courtyard shops (if you looking at table 274, it's to the left facing binders) the small store holds a lot. I wandered in overlapping circles for about 30 minutes, and I'm sure I missed plenty. Some areas have a large grouping of pieces from the same country, but some shelves are more color-themed or similar use pieces.

A lot of the ornaments were smaller versions of some of the items they had around the store (nativity scenes, instruments, 40 year calendars), and a good portion of the scarves (I wanted to buy them all, and my favorites were priced around $30 - $40) and hats are from the Andes region. The menorahs were amazing (maybe I'm fascinated since I've never had one in my home or shopped for one, but these seemed quite unusual). Scattered all over the store I first found one made of bike chain, then a camel elongated to have a candle holder on each hump, and a few family-like set ups (mother version of animal with 8 children). \\n\\nLots of jewelry, home accessories, carved wood, recycles magazines, woven baskets... if you're looking for something unique, you can definitely find it here.

        "I went here on a Friday night, and like everyone else says, it is your average bowling alley.  However, I did not care for the customer service.  I called around 2pm to book two lanes for my husband and I, as we are practicing on bowling not just hanging out like most other people.  I was told that they booked us two lanes and when I showed up at 7pm, we only got one lane, which would normally be okay, but there were clearly lanes available.  Then, the people next to us were acting quite immature and not even bowling most of the time.  They were walking down the lane and lying down on the ground.  This was annoying especially because they received two lanes for three people and when I brought this up to the front desk, they didn't have anything to say, which I feel was plain rude.  In fact, when I brought this up to the front desk, they looked at me like I was stupid and then they saw for themselves that the people next to us were walking down the oiled lane!  I don't mind having one lane, but don't tell me that I am going to have two lanes and change it just because there are kids there the same age of the staff.

        "Review: When Smokey Bones first arrived here in the University area, we went several times and enjoyed ourselves greatly.  The brisket was smashing, the pulled pork was very good, ribs were spot on (this was before I became a Yelper).  So we decide to go last evening and MAN were we disappointed.  Now, I hate that my second review rivals my first inasmuchas I am not writing a good review, but I feel that this must be done before any Yelper out there goes and blows good money on dinner here.  \\n\\nThe most disappointing aspect of our visit was the smoked beef brisket.  I cook and understand that to keep brisket moist, there needs to be a fat content to the meat.  What I recieved last night was underprepped and under cooked brisket (It was done to temperature, but for brisket to be done correctly, it must be cooked until the fat renders more making the meat tender).  There was so much fat, and it was fairly tough.  \\n\\nMy wife ordered the Chicken Portobello ($13.95) and got a grilled chicken breast (Dry) next to a stuffed protobello mushroom (burned).  I still haven't figured out what we paid that preposterous price for.   \\n\\nThe kids enjoyed their meals: a dry chicken breast for my son and a slightly overcooked burger for my daughter, but she mainly ate the fries (which were good!)\\n\\nThe shining star of the meal was the St. Louis ribs on my combo plate.  Smokey and just tender enough to eat easily without literally dropping off the bone.  Unfortunatly they no longer keep BBQ sauce at the table (you have to ask for it?!?!) and I used to enjoy mixing up the varieties to make new flavors.  \\n\\nThe food was disappointing, but what further bothers me is that had I been the waiter, I would never have served the food to my wife.  It was visibly dry and not terribly appealing.  I worry for the service industry when servers are expected to serve unappealing food rather than taking it back to the kitchen and getting a fresh plate (Bottom line restauranting).  \\n\\nAnyhow, I am not a problem customer, I just expect a little more...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Had a similar experience as the previous poster except that my hygienist was very nice (Kimber).  She did have some unorthodox procedures compared to other hygienist, but I am certain they are all required by the attending dentist/group.  She was always polite and very conscious of any discomfort. \\n\\nDr. 'Mo' ( NKUTU-KIRUNDA, MOHAMMED ) on the other hand should be avoided when possible.  He was very unusual in his interactions and within minutes of meeting me he started a sales pitch stating that I would certainly need dentures later in life if I did not undergo his Invisalign treatment in addition to other things.  Having had braces just a few years prior he definitely was looking to sell other services.  Having been to dentists in several locations I can say that he was probably one of the worst I have encountered.  \\n\\nThis group specializes in cosmetic dentistry so I was not overly surprised with the sales pitches for new cancer screenings, Invisalign, and Sonicare specific tooth brushes, but was surprised at the nickle-dime approach used on some basic cleaning issues and attempting to use scare tactics like dentures to have people have additional work done.  \\n\\nAlso, they will charge you $15 out of pocket to apply fluoride after polishing!?  Never heard or experienced any thing like that before.  If you do go make sure you ask the hygienist or desk staff what will and will not be covered.  \\n\\nWill not be going back...\nSo I would like to give it",

The prices are very low - and the rooms were comfortable enough to stay in again.\\n\\nMy problem was with two things:  1) the bathroom was crap.   I'm tall, but no giant.  I'm 6'3.   And the showerhead was made for someone who, in my most humble opinion, could only be described as a dwarf.  The water was hitting my nipples - not because it was aimed there, nay that's the height of the shower! \\n\\n2)  The roomservice price.   I ordered breakfast which was $14.  Not bad.  But what was described as \\\"eggs, hashbrown, and your choice of bacon, sausage, ham AND a drink\\\" \\n\\nGood deal right?   Well, when you thrown in the $3 DELIVERY CHARGE  (It's freaking roomservice, how else was i going to get it?!?)

It is a rather small museum consisting of a variety of Military and Commercial Aircraft's housed in a single hanger. The centerpiece of the Museum is the US Airway Airbus A320 which was force to crash land in the Hudson River after striking a flock of birds which disabled both engines. Everyone on-board US Airways Flight 1549 survived what has been described as \\\"The Miracle on the Hudson.\\\"   While at the \\\"Flight 1549\\\" display be sure to watch the documentary presentation, which details the events of Flight 1549 from departure, the landing in the Hudson and the rescue. Also on display is a Douglas DC-3 that was flown by Piedmont Airlines and a DC-7, flown by Eastern Airlines.  There are several Military Aircraft's also on Display including a Harrier Jump Jet and an F-14.  The museum has a small gift shop with a number of Flight 1549 related items.  I enjoy my visit to the  museum and would encourage anyone who has a long layover in Charlotte to visit the Carolinas Aviation Museum.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

We sat outside in the lovely and peaceful courtyard by the fountain. The waitress was very earnest and sweet. I ordered a Tuna MELT with sweet potato fries. Everything on the plate was cold, though the plate was warm. There was a sprinkle of cheese on the top that looked like it was broiled for 20 seconds to brown, but even that was cold. I asked the waitress to have them re-heat the sandwich, and maybe put a little more cheese on the top. She returned with the cold sandwich and cold fries. She told me that the chef said 'that's how the sandwich is supposed to be'. She even came out with another waitress that affirmed that the tuna melt is supposed to be cold: \\\"it's a tuna salad and comes cold\\\". I pointed out that my fries were cold. The waitress reached over and grabbed one from my plate and said \\\"yeah, it is cold! I'm sorry.\\\" She came back later and said that the manager was running to a meeting but would take 10% off for me 'for the inconvenience.' I would have rather had some warm food! I tried to be a good sport and eat it, but it was unappetizing so I left it uneaten.

This visit, I had the prime rib since I was trying for something different and the server said it was what they were known for. The prime rib was really good and so was the grilled veggies and baked potato it came with. The food here is pretty good and consistent but I gave it 3 stars because, well, it's a steakhouse and there isn't anything here you can't get at other similar steakhouses. Would I dine here again? Yes, but I like to try new things so it wouldn't necessarily be a first choice.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

That's how good they are. Now, I don't make this a regular thing, but let me tell you... it is worth being sick over. The salted caramel is my absolute favorite and I am a mega chocolate lover. It even trumps the chocolate for me. The nutella macaron is a close second and then the espresso. There are a variety of flavors and if I could, I would try them all. I have not had any other items from here because I am 100% gluten free as well as a million other things, but if this bubble girl who is allergic to everything will eat a macaron from this bakery, you know it must be good!!

My wife and I came to Charlotte celebrating our anniversary and decided to try Mert's per recommendation of her supervisor and because of the high praise the restaurant received online.  We were seated in a reasonable time but it was all down hill from there. We were seated at 7:15pm and were given some bland cornbread.  At 8:15pm we were still waiting for our order to be prepared (cooked)...not brought to us...PREPARED! Now mind you no one even a word of apology or an update on the status of our food during the wait. Finally I had enough and walked out. Our waitress and management still did not offer an apology despite seeing us leave the restaurant visibly upset. We left and walked to E2 (emeralds restaurant) and received the best meal and customer service I've ever experienced. I'd recommend all the other restaurants in downtown Charlotte before Mert's. :-/\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nThere are several Hickory Tavern locations in the Charlotte area, and this one is in the fast-growing Providence Road area.  This also means that it can be absolutely packed, and when there are a few college basketball games on, it's even more so.\\n\\nThis is because the Tavern is not only a restaurant, it is a sports bar.  That makes it a little difficult to classify, but I'll do my best.\\n\\nFirst, you have a largish bar area.  This section alone is larger than many sports bars these days, and it looks even larger because it's open, rather than being cramped and confined.  While there did not seem to be any smokiness to the area, there could have been some.  It was definitely loud, as most any bar will be on this sort of night.\\n\\nNext, you have a dining section, which wouldn't be much different than any other family-style dining area, except for the fact that it was right next to the bar.  So if you take the family, you'll want to be aware of this.  It's not exactly set up for a quiet night out, even on the calmest of times, and this certainly wasn't that.\\n\\nThe good news for older crowds (those without younger kids) is that if you're waiting for a table, you can wait in the bar section.  They also have these very long tables that run the length of the bar area, and you can even eat there if you don't mind the crowd.  We didn't really feel like waiting, and since the whole building had a sort of bar feel to it, felt like it really didn't matter.\\n\\nIn the end, it didn't.  The only problem with this was getting the attention of a waitress.  Once we did, service went along fairly well, though getting refills was a bit slow.\\n\\nThe food was good, and priced decently, but appetizers were expensive, as can be expected in most bars.  Wings especially were not cheap.  But it was all tasty.  I don't know that we'll be back, but it's certainly better than most bars, and definitely a leg up on most sports bars.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

Overall, not a bad experience -- but there were a few things about the place that made me question it's direction. Staff is dressed nicely but offered nothing more than just average service. The only person that was personable was of course, the chef. But the menu was made out of laminated paper in a ringed binder (though the binder was personalized, the quality was not much better than a regular binder you would use at an office). There were so many options of drinks, smoothies, sushi , and combinations of plates that it was a tad bit overwhelming. Later, we found out the desserts had its own menu. There were paintings of what looked like jazz singers on the wall of the tepanyaki section which kind of confused us as the rest of the theme was Japanese. The sushi we had was so-so quality. \\n\\nI've been to a handful of hibachi places numerous times and this is not at all the worst I've seen.\\n\\nI would kindly recommend a more consistent theme throughout, a little more focus on the ambiance, customer service, and quality of food. \\n\\nBut overall -- it was filling and the prices were great.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

Half of the menu was handwritten and taped on the front of the registers, and some of the menus items were not listed but in the system (i.e kids plates, you have to ask.  I ordered chicken breast dinner with two sides and kids plate with one drum stick, i had to order another for a dollar, mac&cheese, onions rings are a side but extra.  It cost $17.00 (1 chicken breast/2 drums sticks.

        "The place has kind of a weird vibe, the place looks very nice with a large black bar type area and several high top tables. The art work that they have hanging up all around the place is a different story. The biggest piece is a painting of Gwen Stefani, not sure what she has to do with a sushi bar?\\n\\nThe food was pretty good, we had a couple of rolls and some noodles. Everything was very well prepaired and flavorful. The service on the other hand was sub-par. We ordered edimame as a appitizer; it did not come out until we were half way through our lunch. When they brought our food out, they had botched our order and brought out several items that we never ordered. \\n\\nThe food was good, but the overall experience was disappointing...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nat first I wanted to like this company. but then their quality really sucked. What I was expecting was their expertise but what I got was a console panel that pops inward. When I made the dude aware of it he walked straight out of the office with this annoyed expression whether to demonstrate how mad he was at the tech or by complaint. Either ways I was left without a word thinking wtf I'm I supposed to follow our what. Obviously I was because how would he be able to see what I'm talking about. Anyways he talks to the tech and then tells me that its made that way and if I want they can screw it in. Again wtf would you want a panel pooping inward ask the time. Give him a call to make an appointment he says. Fine. 2 days later I can't open the door from the inside. Fukk I thought the tech probably messed up in there too because I had speakers installed. Opened it up and sure enough the connector was broke and a poor attempt to fix it by filling holes and a zip tie. I feel that this is something you should mention to the owner if your going to drill into the plastic visible or not. I doubt anyone gets upgraded stereos because they don't give a shi! About their car. So drilling holes, at least give me a call. So instead of getting a professional installation I got some half as$ workmanship. I don't have the time to do an installation myself and that's why I took it to these guys, unfortunately. So why didn't I take it back for them to repair? Do you continually annoy your food server when they already give you bad vibes? I dont want spit in my food and didn't want more broken things in places I can't see. I don't want to have QC their work afterwards. So I did the repair myself. I've uploaded a picture of the broken piece.\\n\\nAnyways people might have been satisfied and maybe I was just unlucky but I'm not going back. I'm happy my door gave me signs of trouble before I dropped off my civic for a new stereo speakers and tinting. I pay experts to be good at their job otherwise I'd just hire a bum to take my money...\n\nReview rating:",

        "The Heard Museum is truly awesome. It's not huge, but they make the most of their space, including short films, longer presentations, and a huge display of kachinas in telling the cultural stories of Southwestern Native Americans. Importantly realizing that Native American cultures are not dead, the museum contains modern artwork and filmed interviews with members of today's Native American tribes. The amount of information given is detailed but not overwhelming, and I would say that the museum represents an excellent introduction to Southwestern Indian culture.\\n\\nOne could complain that the Heard Museum doesn't document any of the internal Indian wars or strife, but on the other hand ,considering the racism these groups still come up against, perhaps its for the best that the rest of us just learn about how complex and beautiful these cultures often were and are. \\n\\nA final note should be given to the beautiful museum itself, which may be the only time I'll ever use the world \\\"beautiful\\\" to describe any building in Phoenix. It resembles images I've seen of Roman villas and its courtyard is very mellow, with a nice cafe and pools of running water. I would even recommend coming just to chill out with an ice tea in a stunning courtyard. I mean, where else can you find that in this town?\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nMy work has hosted a few forum-type shindigs here, and most recently at one such shindig, I had breakfast while listening to people discuss water issues.  I have to admit, the scrambled eggs, potatoes and sausage were much more appealing (and tastier) than listening to a bunch of government and corporate bigwigs talk about how to conserve water.  \\n\\nIt's typical diner fare. But, I will say the scrambled eggs were excellent. I don't like fru-fru eggs that are a undercooked and watery.  I like me some hearty, scrambled in about a pound of butter eggs. And, that is what I got.\\n\\nTom's also has a great vibe -- again the whole diner experience.  Saddle-up to the bar, take in some of the history hanging on the walls, and perhaps see a few Arizona notables walk in (Phil Gordon must be a regular because I spotted him on my first visit.)\\n\\nAll in all, if you want a nice, no-frills, but definitely one-of-a-kind Phoenix tradition, head to Tom's for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Oh, yeah, and they validate your Patriots Parking Garage ticket, so FREE parking... YEAH!\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review: I visit La Canasa several times a week, a week mainly due to their proximity to my office. Luckily their food is pretty decent as are their prices.\\n\\nIf you are going here for lunch you may want to avoid arriving right at 12pm as the line out the door can be quite long. For lunch you order at the counter, and take a number to your seat, and they bring you your food. Tipping seems to be optional in format of dining. \\n\\nAnother unique aspect is their Chips and Salsa bar. It contains the usual corn tortilla chips and the delectable flour tortilla chips. If you have never had flour tortilla chips you are in for a surprise.\\n\\nThe menu consists of the usual Mexican fast foods, burritos of all types, tacos, enchiladas and plates. There are also soups and some authentic items for the brave. For lunch you may want to look at the a la carte menu and save a few dollars unless you are huge fan of rice and beans. Another money saving tip is to forgo the drink as their soft drinks cost upwards of $2\\n\\nI often order the chillie relleno burrito. It is a item I try everywhere as it has many different recipes. Here the burrito has the obligatory chillie filled with cheese covered in a very eggy egg batter and a hot red salsa mix heavy on the peppers. If you like your food \\\"enchilada style\\\" you can order it this way for an extra charge or simple walk over to the salsa bar and smother your burrito with salsa.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nThis hospital was appalling. My visit started with admitting, where they misplaced my paperwork and I had to call my doctor to tell them the problem, who in turn, got the supervisor in admitting to all of a sudden locate the orders that had been faxed to them twice.  Really??  Upon arrival for the surgery, my admission was slowed down by lack of information because for some reason, two days later, my per-op information was not completely entered into the system. Entering the prep room, the nurse inserting the IV poked and missed so many times my vein collapsed and my hand swelled up like a football and they had to move to the other hand, all the while, all she could talk about was the tatto on my wrist, which is a memorial to my son who had recently passed. This, of course, upsetting, depressing, and irritating me right before surgery. Again, really??  Upon waking in recovery, I had major spinal surgery. My entire lower lumbars were fused with an unbelievable amount of hardware. My surgeon, who is not a resident doctor there, was wonderful. Sorry to say, this hospital was too far under his league of expertise. I woke from surgery to an 10 inch incision in my abdominal area and an 8 inch incision in my back, 42 staples, and an indescribable level of pain. I was given no pain control whatsoever. I laid in recovery like this for 9 hours before I was given a room. In the meantime, my husband and other son were waiting in the waiting room for 15 hours at this point, not being told anything about my condition, and when asked, they were told I just went home by a nurse who was impatient and uncaring and didn't bother to check for them. They had to ask another nurse, who finally found out that I finally got into a room, and was told a room number and I was there. They got to the room to find I was not only not there, but it wasn't even my room. When they finally got the right room, they sat and waited there because I wasn't even out of recovery yet. Incompetent.  Once in my room, the nurses were huffy, uncaring,...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

My 6 year old likes to get her toes done with mommy, and was yelled at for trying to turn on the massage chair \\\"That not a toy!!\\\" And after my toes were done I was moved to an uncomfortable chair to sit with a tiny little fan blowing cold air on my feet for 30 minutes!! I could go on but this pretty much covers the basics. I am normally a 20% tipper and for the first time I left no tip. We will most definitely not be back. As inexpensive as this place is I left feeling over charged and unsatisfied. I could have soaked my feet in cool water rubbed lotion on them and painted my toes at home for free and not felt unwelcome.\n\nStars:",

By chance I walked over to Zinc where I was seated immediately! I should have know there was a reason and I found out very soon.\\n\\nAlthough the place was half empty, the manager insisted our party of 2 sit at a tiny table that was soon over- crowded with just a bread basket and a bottle of wine. Where were they going to put the food?\\nWell after they spilled a glass of wine on the both of us while trying to set down our appetizer, I got up and moved us to one of the larger empty tables. The bus staff (who was excellent) help us gracefully make the move. The manager (Ben)  however, still tried to hassle us even though the place was now even emptier than when we first arrived. In spite of all this, our barely-existent waiter took our order after I had to send for him twice. He was not helpful at all in explaining any dishes, and could not make any recommendations when asked for suggestions. He was very bothered by the whole process and seemed more interested in talking to his manager between ever course. I continually had to keep asking for him to keep the dinier moving. When the check came, I caught two mistakes, he over-charged us for a bottle of wine I didn't order and added an appetizer that was supposed to be for someone elses bill. The prices are high enough, there is no need to pad the bill, but double-check it for sure.\\n\\n The food was outstanding! The best short ribs I've ever eaten and I order it everywhere I can. Too bad the dining experience ruined the night. Obviously, the word must be out. High prices, very dim lights (always makes me suspicious about what they are trying to hide) and horrible service explains why there is always a table available. Do yourself a favor, wait the hour elsewhere, it will be better than ruining your night.\n\nStars:",

        "Review: I've been meaning to post this since my last experience there, which was late October of last year. Prior to that visit, we had eaten at Ratcliffe on 3-5 occasions, and the food had always been some of the better in Charlotte, save for a few items here and there- their chicken dishes are never very good, the mini biscuits they serve are like cold little rocks, and there is an excessive use of truffle oil going on with the grits and a few entrees (to the point that we would ask that grits not be included with our meal, the smell makes my fiance ill). But outside of that, everything had been pretty good, with generally decent service.\\n\\nBut then we had the October incident- after that, we never went back again. My fiance had called the day before to make a reservation and had told the host it was my birthday- we don't expect any special treatment because of this, but we'd hoped we would get a slightly better seat than what they usually gave us, which was a tiny two person table against the wall (they did it every time we went). So we arrive on our special night, and are (after the host actually showed up) escorted to the tiniest, crappiest table in the whole place, in the far back left corner next to the water station. The person that seated us was curt and unfriendly. Ok- maybe the other tables were reserved? But mind you, whenever we went, the restaurant was always under half-full, usually well under half-full- the rest of the night, I think I counted maybe 5 couples/groups in and out of the place. \\n\\nI can't recall if the server was male or female, I simply remember that they were not friendly, because it surprised me for the place. The dishes that night were sub-par, which was a first. Some people complain about the portion size- I don't see the problem, the food is well presented, and whenever we order the tasting course, we come out full! Anyway, the whole night, someone was always right behind my head clanking around a water pitcher, and it wasn't pleasant.

        "Having two young kids, 6 years old, I've been to my fair share of birthday parties in town. Laser Quest was one of my favorites! Oh, the kids liked it too. The venue is a bit on the small side but has everything you'd need for a birthday party, or just a fun night out. The entrance is filled with a couple air hockey tables, vending machines, and video games. Before the game starts, you're asked to give yourself a codename and this is how you're tracked inside (how many people you hit, how many hit you).Once you enter the fun zone, you're given a harness/vest equipped with three targets and a laser gun, asked the repeat the playroom rules, and off you go into a black light lit room (everything glows!). Each round is about 15 minutes and it is seriously a lot of fun, especially with a bunch of little kids. \\n\\nThe only thing I'd caution someone about is the harness/vest thing is heavy. Way too heavy for your average 6/7 year old (though I have to say the girls, including mine, seemed to struggle more than the boys). Parents can wear the harness/vest for their kid which allows said kid carry just the laser gun. The vest and gun are attached by a plastic string so your kid can't venture off without you. \\n\\nI'd highly recommend this venue for a birthday party, especially if you have older kids.

        "Review text:\nAs the closest movie theater to my residence, I have made this particular AMC my theater of choice.  They often have movies and show times that other theaters in and around Charlotte simply do not offer.  Maybe because of the 24 available screens, they are able to show and keep more movies in the theater, for longer periods of time.\\n\\nMy standard game-plan is to pick a movie that has been out a few weeks and catch it on a weekend matinee here at AMC Concord Mills.  As others have stated, you generally find the theater mostly empty and void of distractions such as teenagers, kids, and couples intent on public displays of affection in the late mornings and early afternoons.\\n\\nI'm a fan of the automated kiosk in which you can purchase ticks on your own without having to go to the window.  I don't know why more people don't take advantage of this, as its usually a quicker option as opposed to waiting in line.  \\n\\nThe concessions are standard but never below par.  The Cherry Coke is usually crisp and the popcorn is steadily popped throughout the day.  I also like the fact that they allow you to butter your own popcorn as you like at the butter and salt station.  The only down side is that the concession prices are EXTREMELY overpriced and they are always trying to get you to upgrade or spend more money on some gut and wallet-bursting deal. \\n\\nAll in all this is the best movie theater in the area, especially when compared to Starlight or Northlake's theater.\n\nReview rating:",

        "The worst brisket I have ever encountered. Sometimes, the run down shack atmosphere with the dirt parking lot places are where the best food is found, but in this case the crappy outside matches the lousy food inside this terrordome. The entire brisket sandwich combo platter was a complete mess. I heard bells ringing in the back of this place which indicated my brisket was being nuked and then placed on the sesame bun from the grocery store. There was so much fat on this brisket that nothing was edible at all. I mean, fat ripped through every lousy strip of the gross meat that they claim was smoked on premises. There was some very yellow potato salad that was served as my side dish and it tasted very relishy, but not homemade as the the one employee said. A place just can't really operate with one employee either. It's time to raize this shack and let someone build something pretty and nice in this rundown neighborhood. worst brisket ever.

Barely lit, with velvet couches, leather chairs and barely lit lantern lights and a beautiful oversized mirror on the wall.  \\n\\nWhen my date and I had a seat and I was able to take in the ambiance, I couldn't help but notice the clientale. Very well dressed, upscale, sexy and almost secretive. The setup of the seating, seems to bring you in closer to whom you are with, which just looks shady or sexy, depending on the voyeur. The music was nice for the setting and the cocktail waitress was a sweetheart. \\n\\nWe ordered the Dirty Martini's w/ bleu cheesed stuffed olives (my fave) and the bartender nailed it and even gave us a tastey orange drink to sip on. Tasted almost like a rich orange julius.\\n\\nAnywho, if money isn't a problem and you are looking for a very relaxed, sexy environment to take a date or enjoy with some friends, I highly suggest you take a moment to check out this spot.

The roll was the nasty California role with chopped tuna on top and there was  absolutely no spice to the role. I was told by the waitress 'that's how we make our spicy roles'.

        "I have given this shop at least three chances, given that it is very convenient for me and it is a local business; however, I have never left that shop with a smile on my face and have always left disappointed and irritated.  The items for sale are normal things you would expect to see in a snack shop for the most part.  If you want to purchase a soft drink, you have to use a cup that has been prefilled with very little ice and stored in a freezer, instead of a normal ice machine.  That has always rubbed me the wrong way.  How do I know what method was used to load those cups with ice...gross.  I also am reminded any time that I use this location for shipping needs, that they \\\"provide this service as a courtesy, but really only make their money in the shop side\\\", so they encourage me to buy something in addition to using the shop for shipping.  I understand it's a mom and pop shop, but really??  The most recent time I went to the store to ship some return items using two prepaid return labels, Kathy said that she wouldn't ship the items unless I could tell her how much postage the company I was returning the items to would pay.  How am I supposed to know that?  They send you a prepaid return label and say to drop it off at a USPS location, and you're done!  She refused.  I felt as if she was trying NOT to help me.  Based on all of these reasons and my most recent experience, I will never go to this shop again and I will venture to the real post office and deal with much more helpful and pleasant people.

The portions are big and the food is \\\"alright\\\" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.\\n\\nThe food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.\\n\\nLast time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way, either) After that he must have thought we were terrible diners (I don't think I've ever been impolite to someone who is currently at work, or ANYONE for that matter) and he showed it by being silent and plopping things down in a passive aggressive way. It was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died.\\n\\nObviously the attitude of one idiot who can't hide his bad day well doesn't really have anything to do with the restaurant. But it's soooooo bland! Go somewhere else for Chinese! Look up Chinese on Urbanspoon and it'll give you a variety of good, local places to choose from at half the price. My rating for this place is",

It was surface of the sun hot and the fans they had with mist blowing cooled you off just enough.\\n\\nMy husband had read somewhere that the pizza was good so we opted for that, I got a cider and he got a beer on special.  Both were relatively decently priced.\\n\\nThe pizza was the best I've had in Charlotte so far, we opted for the supreme, I think it was called something else but it had all the toppings of a supreme.  Pepperoni, Sausage, Green Pepper, Onion, etc.  The crust was chewy and crunchy at the same time and the cheese and sauce were awesome.  We went to a movie after and totally chowed a piece or two in the car before heading in to the theater!\\n\\nTry this place out when you get a chance!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Seemed like a popular neighborhood restaurant, lots of regulars greeted with a smile or by name.\\n\\nFood was a little salty for my taste, but it was still decent quality and large portions. Plenty of options and no trouble with customizing.\\n\\nThe staff were terrific.  They clearly knew what they were doing, and always went a step above - bringing dough for the kids the roll out, refilling your glass before it's empty, chatting up customers.\\n\\nThe decor features old family photos of the owner's Italian heritage.Great touch.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "The first time I heard about MFC was when I was invited into a book club by a bunch of women at my new job about a year and a half ago. That about sums it up - women love this place, and go there to drink wine and be silly and talk about books from oprah's book club.\\n\\nI get it - there's a pianist, and fresh cut flowers and \\\"florist\\\" and \\\"caf\\u00e9\\\" are right in the name. it's got \\\"silly wine women\\\" painted all over it. When my friend picked this spot as the place for our regular hh get-together for some late 20's 9-5ers it made sense. I went to the web site to check on pricing. I was annoyed to see salads for $15, sandwiches for not much less. No happy hour specials? Now I'm downright pissed. Then I went to check out some reviews and was surprised that so many yelpers had given it poor reviews for service and food quality. How do they justify the prices? And what's this about _microwaving_ the food?!\\n\\nBut, my friend had been looking forward to trying MFC, so I zipped my lip and showed up. I like the space - the long, floor-to-ceiling storefront style windows let light stream in and the d\\u00e9cor is simple and airy. I was the first to arrive and told the host who was at the front (I guessed a manager as he had an air of importance and hurriedness about him and wore a different colored shirt than the rest of the staff) there would be five of us. His response: \\\"ooooooooooo-kaaaay.\\\" Nice attitude. Then, \\\"Do you not have a reservation?\\\" um, for five people at 5 o'clock? No, of course not. It was not busy at all, but he made a big show of wandering around the restaurant, finger to mouth and looking perplexed about my request.\\n\\nFinally I offered to sit at the bar until the rest arrived and continued to go \\\"WTF?\\\" when discovering there wasn't a glass under $12 or a bottle under $50. Again, how is this justified?\\n\\nWhen two other girls arrived about 10 min later, I flagged him down and said \\\"we're ready for a table,\\\" and he again seemed noticeably annoyed (so much so that the other girls...

The waiter was excellent, knowing exactly what to say and do at all times, and the food was very good.  Sometimes I'm disappointed in pasta dishes at Italian restaurants; often they seem to taste better the next day after the flavors have had time to meld, but the Penne alla Norma was very tasty.  The wine was good, although I could not finish the large amount poured, but at least I felt I wasn't being ripped off.  \\n\\nNice atmosphere.  I look forward to trying this place out again, possibly for take-out lunch when the prices are a little lower.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

SmashBurger was pretty busy - I just wanted to get in and get out without having to wait in a big line,  so I opted for NN.\\n\\nThe decor is pretty generic,  family areas with brighter paint on one side - dark earth tones in the adult areas. TV 's all over.\\n\\nI ordered at the window, as you walk in. I ordered a meatball sandwich. And a beer.\\nI was hoping for a meatball sandwich that could at least get close to a \\\"\\\"Busy Bee \\\" meatball sandwich.  No such luck.  Busy Bee is a small mom & pop market in San Pedro,  Ca.  If your ever in San Pedro - maybe to see the USS Iowa - google \\\"Busy Bee Market \\\". One of the finest sandwich purveyors I've  ever encountered. Anyway, this Northside Nathan was OK - but nothing to write home about.  The toasted bun was a mouth scalder. The marinara and cheese had some flavor - but the meatballs themselves were bland. On a scale of 1 to 10 - 10 being  a Busy Bee meatball sandwich - Northside Nathans scores a whopping 4.\\n\\nI rate NN 3 stars. It wasnt aweful, it wasnt bad,  it was just an average meatball sandwich . You probably won't  even remember eating it,  let alone recommend it to others.\n\nReview rating:",

        "I've used them twice.  The first time was a fairly good experience:  they were professional and took good care of my stuff.  So, I hired them again for my next move.  Basically, if you have anything other than the first time slot, they will show up whenever they want, without letting you know.  My fiance and I called them several times to check their arrival status.  We had a 10-noon slot, and they showed up at 1:30 p.m.  When we complained about the lack of communication, we were told by their manager that they have 'ten trucks around town' and there was no way they could be expected to update clients about arrival times.  Very frustrating experience the second time around.   The only upside was it took them less time than expected once they arrived, so it was a little less expensive than we had prepared for.\nSo I would like to give it",

I asked the guy at the counter if I can go to the car and get the other bag... The guy at the counter said leave your purse... I was like can you repeat that thinking that I heard wrong. He said it again and said leave your purse. I told him I wasn't going to do that and if he could just walk me to my car to get my other purse. He was like no we do not do that here.  I was like I wasn't going to leave without paying and how dare you treat me like this... I wouldn't have gone to the counter if I wasn't going to pay... He started taking receipts and slapped one at a time on top of each other on the counter. he was like these are the people who didn't pay. i cursed him out and told him it was an insult if he thought i was going to do that. You idiot! I went back to the table and asked my cousin to take my keys and go to the car to get my purse. She just gave me the money and I paid without giving a tip. It was such an insult.

        "From a general standpoint, the business is very comparable to a Hooters. If you're a guy, you'd probably enjoy the scenery for obvious reasons. As per my first trial run, I quickly began to develop the ideal that the business is a hole-in-the-wall biker hangout, which for me, also has its appeal. Unfortunately, it has a service attitude that parallels such. The service is very below par. Even with some only serving 1-3 tables, servers still manage to delay and/ or screw up orders. This includes soft drinks or alcohol AND has occurred every time, out of four trips out there.\\n\\nAs far as the food is concerned, I haven't had a complaint yet. Decent menu for the given atmosphere. They have a chicken sandwich there that I always need a box for and can literally use for one, or sometimes two additional meals. Yes, the chicken is like a whole chicken in a giant bun. The bun does not do this breast justice. It is huge! \\n\\nIf you are looking for a nice low key hang out where you can get together with a few buds and shoot some pool (4, 9ft tables here in a separate room), have a few beers, and have time to wait for food to go along with that beer, this place can be ok.\\n \\n-Do not go at lunch (especially if you only have an hour break).\\n \\n-Place order at bar.

My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide, however my pencil skirt was safety pinned to the hanger.  The weight of the skirt caused even larger holes than what were placed there by the pins.  Being that it's a pencil skirt designed to have a blouse tucked in, there's no way that I can wear it again.  This was an expensive skirt, completely ruined.  Very disappointed.  Again, this review is just for the dry cleaners.  The rest of the store is actually better than a lot of other GE's I've been to in Pittsburgh.

The class managed to be both gentle, yet challenging -- not easy to manage (please note that this is not a traditional restorative class, with long holds and an emphasis on relaxation). The instructor had a good background and emphasized correct form, so participants didn't' hurt themselves. Like any good yoga teacher, she offered modifications and encouraged people to work at their own level and not hurt themselves. The pace was relaxed. The only feedback I would give Desert Song is that the class should have started and ended on time; we started a little late and ran late. It happens, though. \\n\\nDesert Song's staff was uniformly friendly, helpful, and positive. The facility was lovely, clean, and quiet, and I really appreciated not having to pay to rent a mat (every studio in D.C. charges for this), since I didn't bring my mat on my travels. The studio had nice bolsters, blankets, straps, and other props readily available. The energy of the place was really good, and I will definitely swing by on future trips to Phoenix.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Not a great grooming department & customer service stinks.\\n\\nFirstly, I called to make an appointment at  the grooming department about 2 weeks in advance and ask that the main groomer tend to my cat because this would be his first time at the groomers. They agreed and I set up the appointment. Upon entering the grooming area the groomers were all outside smoking and no one was at the desk. I waited for about 15 minutes and then I went outside and asked to speak to someone regarding getting my cat groomed.\\n\\nAfter they came in we discussed grooming and agreed on getting him an oatmeal bath, nail clipping, and trim. I had asked that he recieved a lion cut due to the Vegas heat. \\n\\nI was quoted an hour for the entire service so I was excited about the time due to the  fact I would be able to pick up groceries while he was being pampered. But before I left I noticed that here was some non-needed loud dryers going on in the back room (which had no animals in it). I asked that they only use the dryers when needed due to the fact that he is scared of loud noises, they ignored my request and tried to take him to the back. He of course would have none of that and they had to turn them off anyway.\\n\\nWhen I arrived back to pick him up he was just then getting dried. Another hour later they said he was done (2 1/2 hrs so far). They put him in his carrier before I saw him so I assumed he was done as we had discussed, payed them a pretty penny for the work, and went home. When I got home and took him our of the carrier I found that half of the agreed upon services were not completed. He had no lion cut, had danrif all on his fur, and his nails had been jaggly done. Needless to say I will not use their grooming services again.\\n\\nIn addition to the bad grooming services, this Petco has awful customer service in store. The cashiers are rarely avaliable up front and if you have questions or need anything you have to wonder around the store for some time to find someone. I personally refrain from going to Petco and...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Cracker Barrel is, usually, a favorite of mine. I love the tacky store out front with all the silly gifts, decorations, candies, etc. I love the environment inside, with the fire place, checkers, and little triangle game on the tables. But #1 is the food. I love good ol' Southern food!\\n\\nThis Cracker Barrel's food was lackluster, at best. The food wasn't even particularly hot. Their sweet tea was a disgrace in the name of sweet tea. The grits were absolutely disgusting and an embarrassment to have been served.\\n\\nI have to admit, I wasn't totally surprised - we're nowhere near the actual south. But nevertheless, I came in hoping for a tasty delicious southern meal, and left hugely disappointed.\\n\\nOn the upside, the service was fine.

        "I stopped in to buy birthday cupcakes for a friend, but ended up getting brownies and chocolate croissants and lots of bread. I try to stop in here once a week for my bread now. They have a lovely selection of breads, from walnut raisin to ciabatta. So far, I'm not a fan of the chocolate croissants, but the breads are scrumptious. \\n\\nThe employees there are really nice and make helpful suggestions. The prices are pretty good. The same kind of bread is the same price at Giant Eagle (about $4-5), but I think the one at Allegro is fresher. Plus, I like the idea of supporting a local bakery that makes small-batch breads. There is also a shelf by the door that has day old bread for 40% off. I got one once and it still tasted pretty fresh. My rating for this place is",

Too cheesy and my intuition says it is not a blend of cheeses (just mozz) making for a oily one-dimensional pie.  Crust is week, without flavor and cannot hold up to the amount of cheese on the pie.  Sauce is unremarkable.\\n\\nIf you are used to Chicago stuffed pizza (My Pie, Gino's, Lou's, Burt's etc) you will be VERY disappointed.

        "Review: Let me start out by saying I love REI, I'm a former employee and a member for the last 8 years.  I'm giving the REI in Tempe 3 stars simply because of their selection, or lack thereof.  The employees are fantastic and much more laid back at this store than the PV store which I like; however the last few times I've been in to purchase something specific they just don't have it and I've been left disappointed and frustrated.  The store is probably the smallest REI I've been to out of 4 states(AZ, NM, CA and CO) so they just don't have the room to stock even what seems like 50% of what is available online.  If you are looking for bike stuff just go to PV. My boyfriend even mentioned the last time we were there about how small the mens clothing section was.  I went in last year to purchase the new surefire headlamp and they didn't even carry it...had to drive up to PV.\\n\\nThis store is great if you are looking for those last minute camping supplies (food,fuel) or ordering online and picking it up there but if you are looking to make a major purchase (backpack, tent, bike) just save yourself the trip and head to the PV store. \\n\\nI hope one day soon REI will move this store to a better and bigger location.  They should have moved over to Tempe Marketplace.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I just left this restaurant 15 minutes ago and decided to sign up for Yelp to write this review. \\n\\nListen, Aunt Chilada's, before tonight... was a mediocre restaurant near where my boyfriend works. We'd sometimes go there for lunch if we needed a quick bite, and the salsa was good. So it was there to fill our need if we really had nowhere else to go. That being said, tonight was a disaster.\\n\\nI'm sure it's because they had a few large groups of people who'd already sat down before us in the banquet room, wherever that is. But we waited for over an hour for our food. When it arrived, my burrito had cheese in it (I am lactose intolerant and asked for none). The waiter was courteous and zipped back to get me my correct order, but came back a mere ten seconds later with a cold burrito. Really? I know I've already waited, but at least give it to me warm.\\n\\nAll in all, the server generally ignored us because the table to our left was angry they weren't getting any food, and the table to the right of us had a solid 30 people in it. So, I get it in a sense. But it would've been nice to have them tell us straight out that they had a 46 person table on the other side of the restuarant that just ordered, and that the giant party to our right hadn't gotten their food yet either. It would've saved me a lot of time. Definitely was not worth the money, and never will return again. My rating for this place is",

I say this because it seemed like a surprise to the gentlemen that we spoke with and the person that the arrangments with was not there that day.\\n- The initial attitude when we walked in did not go away the entire visit and took away from the whole experience. Even though the glass between the range and the showroom is bulletproof you can still see people getting pissed off and glaring though at you. Also, the \\\"What?\\\" when you went to the counter was not that inviting either... how about a \\\"Hello can I help you?\\\" or a \\\"What can I help you with\\\" \\n- There was a point when an older staff member went to the lane on the far right and fired off a succession of shots in a row to test the younger manager to see if he would do anything.

So I was a bit anxious and apprehensive, but I ended up leaving with a smile on my face. The staff here are top notch professionals. They are friendly and thoughtful and made me feel completely comfortable. Jan took me back to an exam room and had me laughing and feeling right at ease.

She was just a wonderful and nice woman.\\n\\nThen in comes Dr. Howard Farran, who had me rolling right from the get go. So funny and super knowledgeable!

        "Review text:\nI'm a fan of Quiznos, love it a hell of a lot more than subway, but this particular location is one I will be avoiding. I ordered a ultimate turkey club on rosemary. I asked that they toast the tomatoes and onion as they used to, but now you have to request this. The young man making my sandwich and my daughters oh so basic ham and cheese seemed to be in a state of confusion. Not sure if he was new, but he would pause from making the sandwiches and walk over to his co-worker and I can only assume ask him what to do next. I can forgive this, I understand if your new, so I gave him a pass. The problem was the guy he was asking for help came over to take charge and he forgot to toast my tomatoes and onions even though I made sure he knew that's what I wanted. The new guy had no idea how to work the register, so he left it for the more experienced that was working on my sandwich. I told him we were eating there and as he's putting my pepporcinis and lettuce on my sandwich then realizes he did not toast my onions or tomatoes......now I'm irritated. So he puts some on a tray and runs them thru, still didn't taste the same, they were still cold. He starts wrapping my sandwich then realized I said it was to eat in. Unwraps the sandwich and transfers it to another piece of paper, all of my pepporcinis, some tomatoes and a good majority of my onions spill out onto the paper he's removing from. He then proceeds to apologize as he was still recovering from a wild night out. I have to be honest I didn't care for his excuse, your just listening to your customers request and making a pretty basic sandwich. The sandwich was not good was missing my pepporcinis and my toasted onions and tomatoes. Oh and they don't honor the groupon at this location, so that was another ding. I'll just head over to the location on Ann rd where they seem to have their shit together and DO honor groupon.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review: Great place for bargain shoppers. By now, you should know that I love a bargain. Maybe it was because my (single) mom, would bring me along on her many jaunts in San Francisco, going to various little markets, outlet stores and haggling with Chinatown merchants (how embarassing, but if you are Asian, you can relate!). My mom was a great bargain shopper. I admit, when I was a kid, I was not proud of it, but I can appreciate it, looking back.\\n\\nThis is a shopper's paradise, but you might not find something every time. It's kind of like Ross, TJ Maxx, and Marshall's- so it's hit or miss. But it's exciting nonetheless, when you do find a deal here. Great place to find gifts, travel musts, books, and craft items. And yes, you will find brand names. Huge variety of merchandise- from clothing, to cookware to rugs to pet stuff, there are a lot of choices. The price tags display the regular price and percentage of savings.\\n\\nSometimes, it's closed for inventory. Sign up to get their mailed newsletter. I go to this location the most. Great place to check out for discounted brand name items.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Good thing, cuz the in-laws were clueless and needed direction. \\nLong story longer, they seemed to enjoy their food somewhat. They said it wasn't super good, but it was good.

        "This is a good sushi restaurant in Mesa.  Tonight (02/14/2014) they appeared to be rather busy.  This is most likely because of Friday & Valentine's Day.  \\n\\nWe ordered the mix tempura and the sushi boat. \\n\\nMy wife is particularly picky about sushi.  She was impressed.  \\n\\n1) The portion sizes were huge for a sushi restaurant.\\n\\n2) They were NOT skimpy with the fish.  They was a lot more fish with this sushi compared to the other places in the Phoenix AZ (which tend to load the sushi with rice to make up for the small amount of fish they serve)\\n\\n3) The sushi was really fresh.  \\n\\n4) The crabmeat sushi tasted like real crabmeat and not surimi or flour (imitation crabmeat)\\n\\nAbout the only thing we could have done differently is order less food.  It was a lot, and we ended up taking part of it home.  \\n\\nWe would most likely go back here.  I will definitely take my in-laws (from Vietnam) here, and my own parents.  My parents are particular about their sushi.  \\n\\nThis place looks like it has a good clientele.  I hope that they keep busy, and are able to stay in business for years to come.\nSo I would like to give it",

Neither acknowledged me in any way shape or form while I was there.  On a visit after this initial review - same exact scenario but I was the only one there on a weekend evening - I was acknowledged by an associate whom I stood in front of and she informed me of their sale going on.

Our order was taken by the rudest little b*tch east of Saigon. This old jabba the hutesque looking troll continuously gave us dirty look after dirty look.  We ordered 2 different bowls of pho and an appetizer of deep fried Vietnamese egg rolls. The egg rolls were actually pretty good, however the pho was terrible.  Trust me people I am well versed in the world of pho and when I say it sucks, it sucks. The broth was the most uneventful bland liquid I've tasted in a while.  I shouldn't need to continuously doctor up my pho by adding ingredient after ingredient to provide my taste buds with the slightest resemblance of flavor.  \\n\\nOk so the food sucked. Fare enough, lets leave.  Easy feet to accomplish right...wrong.  God forbid you get somebody to acknowledge you after your food has arrived.  Just getting someone to look in you general direction so you can flag them down is like pulling teeth.  Crap food, terrible service, grumpy employees. One star is one to many.

When I finally got the courage to ask about the ink pad, the workers all looked at each other as if to say \\\"Who's going to handle this?\\\" before one of them grudingly got up to search for an ink pad that, as it turned out, \\\"didn't come in with the shipment\\\".

        "I had fun, it's a beautiful place.  The service was really good and I love buffet dining.  Here's the thing.  The food ranged from bad to just ok.  I am there for the food.  There are a couple reviews about this restaurant that exclaim that it's the best buffet ever.  I should have really ignored them and focused on all the more critical reviews on this restaurant as they really rang true.  Normally when the reviews are this mixed I stay far away.  \\n\\nI don't know where to begin.  How about the omelet station.  It takes a tremendous amount of skill to make a good omelet on a flat top.  It just isn't done this way.  You have to spread out a lot of egg and quickly fold it onto itself to give it any depth.  If you leave it flat, it's done before you can warm any ingredients or melt any cheese.  I watched rubbery brown thin wrappers of egg surround cold and bland ingredients flow from a well meaning omelet station attendant.  How could you? \\n\\nI didn't realize it until later but if you're looking for the french toast, it's hidden in back of the omelet station in a hotel pan.  I never did find it until we were on our way out the door.  \\n\\nThe best 2 things about this brunch were the automatic donut machine and the bagels.  Neither of which this place makes on their own.  In fact, I noted quite a few things they don't actually prepare here at all.  \\n\\nThe meat carving station looked nice and I chose the Gobi Dessert of pork loins.  It isn't 1950 and you don't have to cook pork within an inch of it's life anymore.  There wasn't anyone in the kitchen today that knows how lean a cut this is and how if you're going to put it out on a carving station it should be cooked til slightly pink in the center. \\n\\nThe desert station isn't worth my time to talk about.  There isn't a real pastry chef there and the cookies were clearly out of a box.  The chocolate cake tasted like Duncan Hines with the frosting that you get out of a can.  Another sad and depressing effort here in the Burgh.  Sigh. My rating for this place is",

        "We have been going here to the Gilbert campus about a year and a half. Children's section is fantastic...have had no problems. They give you a card/keyring tag so you can use the scanner yourself and check your child in if need be, and they make you show the matching sticker when you pick your child up. I do not know if the child care or other kids' workers have to go thru background checks.\\n\\nPastor Chads sermons ( they call them talks) are usually well-delivered, when he is there. It seems about half the time he is not and there is another pastor preaching, though. \\n\\nThe student ministry has a lot of fun things to do before and after service in their section, plus they have a juice bar where you can buy smoothies, etc, but the camps are pricey (both winter and summer camp) and my child didn't seem to get much out of camp either time, plus there are bullies at the camps, I guess like everywhere, but they didn't take enough precautions to prevent it even after knowing it had been happening.\\n\\nThe church likes to do a lot of various outreaches to the community,  like collect food for the shelters, etc, but sometimes, it seems they have their hands out just a bit too much asking for $$ for the various things so they can meet lofty goals that they set based on previous experience.\\n\\nThere are tons of small groups to get involved with. There are also ample opportunities to serve in quite a few areas and it's NOT overwhelming, like \\\"we need u every week!\\\". Both of these things will help you feel like you know people/have friends in such a big church if you participate.\\n\\nLastly, and this is one of the big disappointments of mine besides the bullying at camp...the music during worship is only so-so. They often sing songs that I have no clue what the song is (I thought maybe it was because I was new at first...but I am not new now and still happening). They rarely sing any older contemporary songs or hymns. And, to top it off...after every single song, the band does not transition naturally to the next song.... My rating for this place is",

        "Review: After renting a vehicle & adding insurance which I had paid 3 days upfront @ $20.99 per day (a total of $72.61) I begin to notice that they also began taking different amounts out of my account daily ($24/$25/$25) after the 3day rental period I went down there and had the insurance taken off of my rental by Robert who gave me no paper work with the discontinued insurance info. The next day they AGAIN had taken out an additional $25 so I returned the vehicle, spoke with the no good CS manager \\\"Jennifer\\\" who made no sense and instead gave me excuse after excuse as to why I was charged for 7days after having the vehicle for a total of 5. The best she could say was \\\"I know it seems confusing\\\" lol. Now to top the cake, almost a week goes by only to see that they charged my account another $145.21 which I of course filed a claim a disputed the charge. However bottom line is I wasn't the only one as I came across 655 consumer complaints against \\\"hertz\\\" in just a years time which a lot of these had been similar cases. As long as I live I will NEVER again rent a car from Hertz and advise others to do the same to avoid this type of inconvenience. STICK WITH ENTERPRISE EVERYONE!

Though we had been warned that taxis might be scarce, especially for our big group, we saw a lot at our hotel.  But, it turns out, Pittsburgh has a thriving uber network and we ubered all around town.\\n\\nBack to the hotel.  I do love a Marriott.  Their rooms are always super clean and designed with the cool, modern lines that we all wish our home bedrooms enjoyed.  It's a perfect hotel for business travelers because the rooms have lots of flat open spaces to really spread out your stuff.  Though no hotel bathroom ever has enough hooks for towels and clothes for me, Marriotts come close.\\n\\nBut, of course, what makes this more than just a Marriott was the people.  From the moment our group checked in, joining hordes at the desk, I was impressed by the staff's friendliness and efficiency.  We had a great stay, enjoyed terrific service in the restaurant and bar.  Two moments stand out.\\n\\nDuring the course of the conference, we went into the room scheduled for our presentation and were dismayed by the set up.  We needed more chairs and assumed there would be a lectern, and a few other things.  (It was a standard setup that no doubt was ordered by the conference.)  I corralled one of the Marriott employees, expressed my concern, and he PROMPTLY got on it--extending a table, supplying the lectern, and all in all, making it right and making doing it fast.  They could have balked, saying that what we got was what our organization ordered, but none of that!  Positive attitudes and results.\\n\\nAfter the panel... My rating for this place is",

        "Review: This Motel 6 provides most of what you'd expect at this price point, (roughly $50/night).  The parking lot is well lit and secure.  (I parked in front of the office.)  The rooms are clean and the TV and air conditioning work well.  All the lights worked.  There was no shampoo, but they do provide small bars of soap and clean towels.  The bed was comfortable and I slept well.  They offer nothing in the morning except a fresh cup of coffee in the lobby (no coffee maker in the room).  The WiFi was free and worked very well.  Overall, I'm glad I stayed here, especially when I consider the money I saved.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "It has all kind of been said as far as this place goes, so I will keep this brief.\\n\\n1. The food is delicious (I had the citron chili with tofu and my girlfriend had the pad thai), but the portion sizes are way too small.  Fate was probably the first Asian restaurant I ever walked away from feeling like I did not have enough to eat.\\n\\n2.  Where is the host or hostess?  I am not sure what it is about hip new restaurants and not having a system set in place for people to be seated, but it is annoying, frustrating, awkward, and somewhat embarrassing for the patrons who end up standing in the middle of a restaurant looking around for some sort of guidance.  Honestly, just a small sign saying \\\"please wait to be seated\\\" would be fantastic.\\n\\n3.  The service was uneven.  We had to wait a bit to figure out if we seat ourselves or if we wait for one of the staff (it was the latter).  Once seated, we waited several minutes before our waitress came over to take our order, but we did get our food quickly after ordering; then, we did not see our waitress again until she was bringing us our check.\\n\\nFate really deserves two and a half stars rather than three.

        "I've lived at San Antigua for about 3 years.  My apartment is not updated, which is fine with me, because it saves me money (and I work only a mile away, so the commute is fantastic).  They did put in all new appliances about a year and a half ago, but I think they are the lowest quality possible. The original microwave had a tag inside that it was manufactured in August 1993 and it was not pretty.  But it was clean and it worked better than my new one.  Same with the other appliances. I would have been happy if they had replaced the washer with a efficient front loader!  But the one I have doesn't even have a delicate cycle.  I wash all of my work clothes in lingerie bags (I have about 10 now) to protect them from the beating they would get in that washer.\\n\\nI have had a few maintenance requests, and they have usually come right away.  I noticed comments about the water being off, and the water was off often.  Once until late at night (when the notice said during the day only) and there was no way to get an update.  It was very inconvenient and annoying, but that is resolved.\\n\\nMy main issue is with the office staff, which is what is driving me to write today.  The two main ladies I've interacted with in the last year (I think one is gone now, but her replacement is no better) are not helpful at all.  Last year I was going to be away for 4 weeks and I asked about how I could handle my rent and my water bill payment (I was to return on the 4th of the month).  I could pay my rent ahead of time (not ideal, but that's fine). But for the water bill, I should pay more than the amount I paid for that month to make sure I covered next months, because they charge you a late fee if you are one day late.  I think they should have worked with me for the $20 water bill that would have been 5 days late.  Their attitude was \\\"too bad\\\" and they weren't even nice about it.\\n\\nThere used to be a drop box that I would drop my rent into on my way to work on the first, but that is now gone. You can pay your rent online now,...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "I went to see Dr Boyers to have ear wax removed today. I waited for almost an hour before they put me in the room. His assistant removed my ear wax with water in a medal syringe. Then she said she wanted to do a couple more tests. I came in just for wax removal and I am not interested in other tests, also I was behind for another appointment because of the long wait.\\nThen Dr. Boyers came in, spent one second  looking into my left ear, and hardly looked at my other ear. He told me they must do a pressure test on the ear drum to make sure there is no puncture. He told me if I don't want to do this, then I will not be seen in his office again. Being turned off by his attitude, I said that is fine with me. He then followed me to the front desk and said very loudly to his receptionist and in front of the people in the waiting room: Put this in his file that he is not going to be seen in this office again!\\nDr. Boyers, don't worry, there are many other nice ENT doctors in Las Vegas.

At first, my friend DeDe and I thought we may be the only ones in our PJs, but there were a handful of others too...\\n\\nThe show was a lot of fun... extremely talented cast, so much energy, great retro colorful costumes, and songs that I loved without even knowing the words to!  The orchestra and cast worked really well together and there were certain acts in the show that reminded me more of a 'Stomp' type of show with the movements and sounds really in sync.\\n\\nAs Doug mentioned, the lead roles of Sid Sorokin and Babe Williams really shined - they had great chemistry on stage!  This was a wonderful show.  It may have been my first experience seeing an Arizona Theatre Company production. but it definitely will not be my last.  Go see The Pajama Game while it's still in town - it's here until January 20th!  After that, they've got some other shows that I'm excited for as well...\\n\\nOne more thing - the Herberger Theater Center is a wonderful venue; just make sure to give yourself a little extra time for parking before the show.\\n\\n______________________________________________________\\n\\nTo Kill a Mockingbird - March 27, 2008\\n\\nAnother 5 star performance on this adaptation of Harper Lee's classic novel.

Aside from the challenge of hearing some of the dialog with the deep southern drawl, I thoroughly enjoyed this show.  \\n\\nI agree with Erica L in saying that 'Scout' was adorable and totally in character through the entire show - I loved her enthusiasm and no doubt she's got a future full of acting.

        "I'm always focused when I come here. I have a goal hit the movies up for popcorn and head to the poker table. The dealer does not shuffle the card fair enough for me. They do it like a 5 year old just lay the cards on the table and mix em around a bit and then while this takes place they talk to people who come often. Hey Jimmy how ya been? How's the wife and kids? Then the cards are dealt and Jimmy gets a Full House and the dealer gets a tip. (Its easy to see why I am not crazy about this.) It looks at if Jimmy has the dealer in his pocket. So I wont return anytime soon. Now I know that the casinos does a good job of watching people who cheat but I have a uneasy feeling so I wont return. I know that people at times can get to know a dealer we all have poker names just when a dealer is overly friendly to one but does not do any talking to others it makes me wonder.  \\nI sat thru 2 games a day for almost a week. And I have to say I will just go where no one knows anyone's name. I'm a good poker player Id say about 60% to 65% I just think its something wrong when I sit down and I only win one hand the whole game. I can play in a alley and have better odds.

Ramen is already made and noodles with some beef are so easy to make, so I don't know what was going on in the kitchen.  I thought both dishes were too salty and the cha su was very dry.

        "My husband and I have been to this restaurant many times over the past 20 years and went for sandwiches tonight. Sorry to say it was the worst food we have ever eaten at this place. Reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat. Sweet potato fries were not edible. We ate at a table at the bar and told Andy our bartender but got zero satisfaction. Since we've had such a bad experience and no effort by the restaurant to remedy a BAD MEAL, be warned!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nI went to Lupie's for the first time...finally.  I had heard good things about them from various people, especially about their chili.  Yes, you do have to park in a stoned parking lot.  Yes, it looks a little sketchy on the outside.  Yes, it's not in the best neighborhood.  Fortunately, it was still very light out when we went so I felt very safe and enjoyed the rustic ambiance of the restaurant.  I'm not sure how it gets once the sun goes down.  \\n\\nAt 95 degrees outside, I wasn't really in the mood for hot chili, but I decided to give it a try since it was their specialty.  I ordered the chili mac (chili on top of spaghetti...all covered with cheese...c'mon, sing along with me!).  They have three types of chili (which I'm glad they explained on the menu).  Texas - no tomatoes, hot.  Cincinnati - regular tomatoey chili.  Vegetarian - guess.  I went with Texas.  It was VERY thick, full of meat, and yes, spicy.  YUM.  \\n\\nThe portions are fantastically big; I walked out of there stuffed.  The prices are very reasonable, too, especially for the taste, quality, and portion size.  The table next to us ordered the covered/smothered nachos as an appetizer.  Wow.  It was a HUGE platter full.  I may have to try that next time as my main meal.  My mouth is watering already thinking about it.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Went to visit a friend in Phoenix and she took me to this place. I adore chicken and waffles and I can't help but get it every chance I get! I had the tray-tray? which included 2 fried drumsticks and a waffle. I added a side of mac and cheese & eggs scrambled with cheese (I LOVE CHEESE). I made sure to put the Lo-Lo sauce on my chicken (it's their version of hot sauce). Everything was so delicious!! Topped off my meal with a glass of Kool-Aid! I asked the waitress what flavors they had and she replied \\\"red, blue and grape!,\\\" I had to ask if those were the colors or the flavor, then she gave me the flavors...can you say RACHET?! Anyway, everyone there was pleasant and I enjoyed my meal. Will definitely be back whenever I am in the Phoenix area =) My rating for this place is",

The first flight was delayed and I requested for changing flight. The staff was hesitate to help consumer and I did miss the connecting flight at Phoenix. They kept delaying the flight and I had been waiting since 4pm and it was 11pm at night and I was still at the airport. I tried several times to helps with the flight change or alternative route to get me to San Antonio since I have a customer appointment early in the morning. The answer I got everytime from their staff was \\\"sorry, I can't do anything.\\\". The worst customer I ever had in my life. I won't take your service anymore and won't recommend any of my family and friends to take us airway. Damn! I hope there is no star rating on yelp for this ridiculous airline.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "So this is my second review of the Artisan. My first one was not so nice. I was approached by management and asked to give it chance #4 and honestly I'm so GLAD I did! My Husband and I booked a room in April upon our arrival we valet' our car and the valet ( yet again ) was very cold and not helpful at all.. We checked in with the front desk and what a huge difference! New staff thru out the hotel all whom were eager to accommodate you. The manager was training a new front desk person and both were incredibly friendly and kind. We went up to our small but beautiful room and quickly went down to the lounge for some tasty cocktails. We were greeted by beautiful and kind bartenders who were extremely quick with our beverages. After a few drinks we went to Mood restraunt for dinner. A manager greeted and seated us immediately and he himself brought us our bread basket. We were then introduced to our servers Wes and I believe the woman's name was solie.. Not 100% sure but she was of African American decent and was super awesome. They kept our drinks flowing and delivered our meals in a timely manner. After our meal we lounged around Artisan renewing our love for this hotel and reminiscing over our wedding and reception we had there in October 2010. \\n So as you may have gathered we LOVE The Artisan and the incredible staff especially our 2 servers from Mood ( not so much the valet lol ) and have since returned many times since April with many friends as well. Thank you Artisan for being consistently incredible for the last 3 months. My rating for this place is",

        "The Range Steakhouse was absolutely outstanding. The atmosphere is nice -- there was a piano bar and the music filters through the dimply lit restaurant. The views of the Strip are awesome. We ordered cocktails and they were perfectly poured, mixed, and of generous proportion (this, from 2 former bartenders and picky drinkers). AND, so reasonably priced -- way better than anywhere else we went in Vegas. My husband's top shelf Manhattan, up, was only $9, and came in a HUGE glass - easily 2.5 Manhattans in one. The bread before dinner was a nice change up from the traditional boring bread basket - there were pretzel rolls, bacon cheese herb baguettes, and some sort of raisin spice roll, along with fresh butter. Our server, James, was professional, friendly, and totally unobtrusive. We never waited for a thing, he just appeared to take care of everything right before we thought we needed it. \\nMy other half and I are big time carnivores, and we couldn't have been more satisfied with dinner. We got the bone in New York Strip and the Bone in Rib-eye and shared. The steaks were tender and juicy and my rib-eye was cooked perfectly medium rare. My husband's strip (also ordered med rare was overcooked to medium, but still delicious. That was probably the only disappointing thing, but we didn't want to complain, it still tasted tender and perfect, so the meal went on. We also shared a house salad with ranch, the Alsatian potatoes (with caramelized onions and bacon), and grilled asparagus, which came with fresh hollandaise. THEN, we ordered the pineapple-upside-down-bread pudding for dessert. I could wax poetic on dessert alone for an hour. It rocked and I've been trying to duplicate the recipe since we came home a month ago. \\nWe ate like pigs -- it was our only meal of the day and we more than made up for \\\"lost\\\" calories. All of the portions are huge, definitely big enough to share one side item and a steak, but we splurged. Additionally, we got 50% off the entrees from tix4less (the special excluded the whole...

It all starts and ends on a pleasant or rude phone call and they were rude!! They are dead to me! My rating for this place is",

        "Leidan Mitchell Salon (the Indian School location) is about a 5 minute drive from my office. After three separate attempts at contacting the salon on three separate occasions with no answer or returned phone call, I decided it was best to stop in on a Saturday morning. \\n\\nI was looking to make a nail appointment and did not expect to be accommodated the same day (especially on a Saturday). However, the receptionist exclaimed \\\"of course we can fit you in, no problem\\\". At that, I proceeded to sit in the center of the salon for 15 minutes. I watched the front desk girl approach multiple nail techs all of whom seemed to be busy and/or annoyed. The receptionist returned to let me know that, in fact, they did not have any openings. When I inquired when the next opening would be she took my number down and said someone would be in touch with me soon. \\n\\nAbout three weeks have gone by now, and I have yet to receive a phone call. When I called to follow up, again, there was no answer. When I expressed the difficulty I was experiencing in terms of getting in touch with someone the day I went into the salon - the receptionist gave me a confused look and did not even take the simple, logical step of confirming the number I was dialing (although this is the phone number listed on their website). \\n\\nAll in all, I was turned off by the simple lack of care I was shown as a new potential client. At the very least, a professional establishment in the customer service industry should have a scheduling system (whether paper or electronic) that allows them to easily relay openings to, and book appointments for, interested clients. They could not even offer that. \\n\\nNo establishment should ever leave a customer feeling that their business is not needed, but unfortunately Leidan Mitchell did just that.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I heart Abuelo's.  I'll just start by saying that I initially thought this was going to be an expensive restaurant so hadn't stepped into it until I went with co-workers.  I ordered (and still do) the kid's bean/cheese burrito - very inexpensive and yummy.  The thing I like is that the beans have a peppery taste to them so it's not bland.  \\nThe one thing that keeps me coming back is the chips and salsa.   It's not unusual for me and my lunch buddies to go through 2 bowls of chips and 2 bowls of salsa EACH before we even give our order to the waiter/waitress. I think they put something in it to make you crave it.  \\nFor the price and atmosphere - I can only comment on my kids menu choice ($6) and the lunch crowd (not too busy).\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: First, I want to say from my experience, Chompie's food is very good. Not excellent, but very good.  The service, on the other hand was very poor.  Chompie's is a bit on the expensive side. If there service was good, I might accept that but with poor service, I can't give it higher than 2 stars. \\n\\nI went to the bakery during lunchtime on Sept. 13th. It was busy so I waited in line like everyone else. As I moved along in line I was asked for my order which included a few bagels, some cookies and a takeout sandwich.  So I'm pulled out of line by one lady who want to ring up my order at this cash register at the stat of the line, not at the end of the line where you usually pay.  I start to take out my wallet and she tells me credit card only, if I want to pay with cash,  I have to get back in line and wait for the OTHER cash register.  O.K. I give her my credit card to pay, but I'm thinking that was annoying. \\n\\nShe tells me my takeout order will be ready soon. It was a simple bagel sandwich.  So I wait, and wait, and wait. 15 minutes later I ask the lady for the status of this, and it turns out the lady never sent the order to the kitchen so of course its not going to be done.  5 more minutes and its finally done.\\n\\nThey need to get a bit more organized and provide better service, or I can tell you I will never be back.  There are too many other good places around to deal with one that couldn't care less about my business.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "It's a great community. It's on a busy street, so if your loved one is a little \\\"confused\\\" at times, just be aware of that. The people who live there are wonderful. The management has a few kinks to work out, but the nurse practitioner, the ladies at All Care services, all wonderful people.\\n\\nI want to stress here though that the management is terrible. They change hands so frequently that it just becomes ridiculous to expect any kind of consistency or organization. There is a kind of creepy right wing Republican vibe from one manager, who desperately wants to get rid of the \\\"freeloaders\\\" (anyone who gets any kind of benefits, which is just insane in an environment like this!) **Yes, I'm looking at YOU Mrs. Crane!** then an easy going, \\\"let's see what we can work out for you\\\" the next month. \\nIt's extremely unfortunate and I wish it weren't so. Dealing with them is like being stuck inside a yo-yo. If it weren't for this huge liability, this community could be much more successful,  appealing, and desirable. I know it must be a very competitive market in Phoenix for senior care, but I just think this place is the absolute pits when it comes to their business practices. Not a lot of integrity.

Very long story short: they claim they don't have them, immediately said that I forgot them somewhere else and got very defensive and unfriendly right away and wouldn't let me talk to the waitress.

Still the pieces for what they are asking I would expect to be cleaned up better than they are.

I mean, if I want a microwaved meal the same 50 states over, I'd go to Applechilidennybee's. If I want some down home, from scratch, mama couldn't have made it better cookin', I'll go to Cindy's. \\n\\nBeing a small business, the decor is a little hokey. They're not spending money on some razzledazzle, flash and awe marketing flare. (They have ads embedded into the varnish of their table tops, people! They're selling dining space for revenue! Just so they can keep their entrees cheap as sin!) We sat in a room that was a shrine to John Wayne, big enough to accomodate our 8 person group. There were no less than ten pictures of The Duke. (That includes four duplicates of that wacky picture where the scale of his hat is off and it cuts into his head about an inch.) And to top it all off, there was a mirror running the length of the other side of the room, ensuring that double The Duke stared down at us as we ate. Weird.\\n\\nBut what this little place lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in food. I had a tuna melt on rye that was to die for. Anyone who knows me can vouch for the fact that I believe the tuna melt to be a sandwich of the gods. Fuck ambrosia. They were eating warm albacore over buttery, crisp bread, smothered in cheddar cheese and pan fried to perfection. And the fries were sprinkled with some kind of magic pixie dust that endowed them with the ability to make me profusely salivate.\\n\\nEveryone at the table ordered something different (from the hot roast beef dinner to the fried fish, Caesar salad to the pork fritter sandwich) and it was agreed that all entrees were wicked, fricken good. And breakfast is served all day long. Super score!\\n\\nSo go, pay homage to John Wayne, and he shall reward you with some good eats!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "My friend suggested meeting up here for Friday happy hour. Though I trust her recommendations, I really wasn't anticipating that much. The name -- Harris Grill -- seemed a little ho-hum, and I was expecting your typical Pittsburgh-type place with basic appetizers and lots of Yuengling.\\n\\nHowever, as soon as I sat down, I knew this place was going to be different. First of all, it was packed! The cute little patio had lots of young professionals ranging in attire from girls in maxi dresses to guys wearing dress pants, button-ups, and ties. Thankfully, one of my friends had arrived a few minutes before 5pm and secured the last available table on the patio. Lots of local residents were taking advantage of the absolutely incredible weather to sit outside.\\n\\nAfter quickly becoming intimidated by the enormous drink \\\"book,\\\" I just took my friend's recommendation and ordered a frozen cosmo. Wow! Delicious!! It was the perfect blend of cold but not too icy and not too sweet but not too sour. I could drink these things every day! Well, maybe not every day... because they pack a serious punch! I was warned not to order the additional shot when it was offered to me, and thankfully I heeded the warning. After two of these beverages, I was definitely tipsy! In my opinion, two of these little frozen cosmos pack the same amount of buzz as 3-4 glasses of wine.\\n\\nIn addition to amazing frozen cosmos, I enjoyed trying their appetizers. The spinach dip and pita was tasty, and the pierogies, though very different from the pierogies that I have had in the past, were out-of-this-world good. I was tempted to order a second round of the pierogies but didn't want to appear gluttonous. \\n\\nService was pretty good, especially considering how busy the restaurant was and how tightly we were packed onto the little patio. Our waiter both resembled and acted like Conan O'Brien, which was just the icing on the cake of a great happy hour experience.\\n\\nAnd, finally, the check arrived. My jaw nearly fell on the floor. Three of us girls...\nSo I would like to give it",

My husband, who was just my boyfriend at the time, was secretly planning ( desings, picking out what loose diamond, etc.) with one of the owners Darryl for the purchase of my ring for months, and I was so oblivious. I was very surprised to see he popped the question with my Tacori ring, since my diamond was top heavy, they suggested to put prongs in the inside to help it stay put. Whenever we go here to get my ring cleaned / checked out - they are so welcoming and nice. I believe this is the only jewelry store in Las Vegas to carry the brand Tacori ( I love the quality of this brand, and desings). Forever pleased with my ring, and the service here!

Hey, barkeep, how's about using that metal drink shaker behind you? Brilliant. Thanks Larry.

Acoustics were great as I heard her sniffle at least a couple of times. I didn't enjoy that, mind you, but I kept thinking, \\\"hey, the acoustics are really great\\\".

        "Review text:\nDear Persian Garden Cafe,\\n\\nI was so excited when I discovered your flier on my front doorstep that I immediately emailed a friend in the area to see when we could schedule a time to visit. I also couldn't wait that long, and ended up visiting you two days later, craving good Persian food that is so hard to find here. I researched the menu online, but wanted to make my to go order in person to get a good feel for the atmosphere. This is about where the good stuff ends. Be prepared as I now tell you about the sadness I experienced after I walked in the door.\\n\\nWhen I arrived, and wanted to double check my order on a to go menu, I was directed to one on a table that had 1/3 of the items on the menu you list on your site. I then inquired as to other items I had heard of but weren't on this menu. The staff member was surprised and reluctantly handed me a real menu to which I found the items I wished to order. \\n\\nSo what did I order?\\n\\nA spinach/cucumber dip with naan. The dip was fairly delicious but I didn't get to enjoy much of it due to the naan being hard, almost to the point of being stale. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy? Does it not travel well? \\n\\nThe spicy chicken dish with vegetables and Persian rice with spices and raisins was just meh. Nothing like the dish I was expecting. The rice was the part I was anticipating most, and the part the gave me the most disappointment. \\n\\nThe best part of the entire menu was the lemonade I tried which I think was spiced with a bit of ginger. It was delicious. Sadly this was forgotten about with the bad ordering experience, sub-par food experience and the over the top bill for it all.\\n\\nI may try one more time, this time dining in... but even that scares me a little.\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nThis cleaner has been in the neighborhood for many years. I have used them semi regularly, but the bottom line is -- they are just not very reliable.\\n\\nOnce upon a time, I lived a block away from them, and was always walking past the storefront, which has a more  pleasing ambiance than most dry cleaners (like Footer's). They were a tad more expensive, but I paid it for the convenience and the flattering lighting. At some point, there was some mildly unpleasant incident -- I think they misplaced an item for some period or something like that -- I didn't lose anything, but my confidence in them was shaken, and I stopped going for a while and then I moved.\\n\\nYears passed. Now that the past unpleasant incident is but a dim memory, I thought I'd give them another try. The price is still high; the cleaning job is still mediocre; they patched a couple items for me with varying levels of success. And then, it happened again -- they misplaced another pair of my pants. This time, though, they never did find it. It's bad enough that they lost my pants, but the way they are handling it is making me downright angry.\\n\\nFirst, when I showed up with my ticket, the front desk clerk told me that she couldn't find my item, so I need to come back another day. Since I no longer live a block from them, I had to make a special trip on my day-off from work. It was off-putting to be on their beck and call as if my time didn't matter.  Second, the process is poorly handled. The front desk clerk said that the manager would contact me in a day or so, but the manager did not. A couple days later, I was the one who initiated the call. The manager told me they went through the whole store, but couldn't find my pants. She thought she might check their other store. She said she'd call me back in a day or so. Two more days passed. No call from the manager. So I called again. The manager repeated the same story -- apparently they were understaffed, and she intoned that I was too impatient. I find this response completely unprofessional --...\n\nStars:",

Pho Thanh and Da Vang are by far the best places in Phoenix (that I've been to so far) to enjoy a hearty bowl of delicious pho! If you love pho and haven't eaten here, you're doing yourself a disservice. I had the Da Vang (basically the special that's everywhere else - cuts of beef, cartilage and tripe) and I ordered some Vietnamese meatballs to put in.Every bite of that pho had me sayinh, \\\"Mmm!\\\" My friend and I also ordered the egg rolls and a Banh Mi. Yes, we ate like kings. I've had a better Banh Mi, but Da Vang has some of the best Vietnamese egg rolls that I've ever had for sure...and their fish sauce was perfecto! If you always order spring rolls, take a break and try the egg rolls, and don't forget to eat them properly (wrap in lettuce with other veggies served and dip in fish sauce)! \\n\\nGood gawd, that food was good...\\n\\nDa Vang is an amazing Vietnamese dive with a friendly staff and wonderful food. It totally surpasses my standards for good pho. Picking between here and Pho Thanh is going to begin to become a tough choice, and I would have to say that they are definitely on even playing fields when it comes to pho. Try both!

Here's what I have to say about Qdoba. First off, their burrito is equally as fat as Chipotle's. Qdoba's chicken was a bit dry and the seasoning not as flavorful. The beans too soggy, making the whole burrito extremely soggy. The salsa was not crisp, but mushy. Overall, I thought the burrito was kind of bland due to the lacking of seasoning in the chicken. \\n\\nThe final verdict: I did not finish my buritto. Qdoba disappointed me and I will be back at Chipotle tomorrow. My rating for this place is",

If you go here and order a strawberry lemonade or a quencher lemonade the only difference is one has some canned strawberries added and cost two dollars more without refills.

This restaurant is really conveniently located for my neighborhood. I wish there were more decent restaurants within 5 miles of my house. Also, this restaurant is very affordable.\\n\\nThe bad: \\n\\nThe service! Terrible! It took the server 10 minutes to greet us. At the end of the meal I asked for a to-go box. After waiting 15 minutes for her return I decided to just eat the rest of my meal because I I didn't want to wait any longer. This was a Wednesday night - So I'm going to avoid eating here on the weekend.\\n\\nThe ugly: \\n\\nI had a glass of water. Of course I didn't notice until my very last sip that the glass had a dark, thick, chunky ring on the inside of it- remnants from another drink of some kind. Nothing makes me shudder more than eating/drinking off a dirty dish at a restaurant.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Now while i am not a huge fan of Mexican food...my  wife is and that is why i am reviewing this place...because she sends me to this \\\"hood\\\" on a regular basis. When we were here in June she went twice in the same week and i have already there again since we moved here. She loves the the Burrito enchilada style with green sauce and rice and beans. I promise you when you get this food they put it in a container that keeps it hot for at least 3 hours...and i mean hot people. Now there are only about 5 items on the menu...and i will post those pics as well...and you will see that this Mexican food is expensive.\\n\\nDespite all of that though there is always a crowd at this neighborhood spot...and you will see people from all walks of life there for lunch every single day. Now noticed i said lunch because they only stay open to about 4pm and then they are ghost folks...LOL. So i have to say if you want authentic Mexican food and don't mind going to the \\\"hood\\\" to get it...it will be the best 8 bucks you ever spent on Mexican food...at least that's what my wife thinks...LOL.

        "In search of a good breakfast place I came upon The Good Egg. I was definitely disappointed. I should have read more of the yelp reviews so to have avoided this place. I agree with Scott S that this place should be called \\\"The Bland Egg.\\\"\\n\\nI ordered the \\\"Hearty One\\\" crepe egg which included bacon, ham, sausage, mushroom & grilled onion that came with an English muffin. A crepe egg is whipped egg whites with a crepe. Despite all the ingredients in the crepe it lacked flavor, it was literally bland, no seasoning at all. No amount or variety of hot sauce that was available on the table could salvage it. In addition, the crepe was this boring beige color which was fitting because the dish was boring as beige.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the \\\"BLT Supreme\\\" which normally comes on a 12 grain whole wheat toast with 6 slices of sugar cured bacon, lettuce, tomato, sliced avocado & mayo. However, she requested it to be on white toast instead. It came out with a side of seasoned potatoes. The bread came out burnt and too dry. The mayo was barely visible...it was pretty much inedible sandwich. Instead of returning the plate back to the kitchen, my friend just ate the BLT without the bread.\\n\\nMy other friend ordered the \\\"Eye Opener Combo\\\" which came with pancakes, 2 eggs and a few slices of bacon. It wasn't anything spectacular as that can be ordered just about anywhere.\\n\\nTo sum it all up, healthy food doesn't mean it should lack flavor, but that is exactly how this place was. None of the dishes stood out and in fact it was all around bland and blah. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Typical bar place with a area for  a restaurant. Menu is really quite diverse with all kinds of offerings from snaks, lunch, dinner  and breakfast. Server was very up front / helpful. She thought breakfast and lunches were the best, especially burgers.  I elected the chorizo quessidella, partner eggs/patty/hasbrnws. I was prepared to give this place a negative review simply because the wait time for a meal is a bit long...45 min. When the order arrived  I changed my mind. Portions are really large!!! Server said wait time is long simply because kitchen space is very small. With two cooks working line space is short. Order was correct, pipping hot. It was great. This is a good place to come if you just want to grab a brew, play some pool, cheer for your fav football team. Lots of flat screens abound. Your eyes arn't far from one.Doesn't matter if your at the bar or seated the restaurant. From what I overheard Happy Hour is cheap and fun...enjoy...\n\nReview rating:",

Namely, the proximity of every table to the other tables.  I've always noticed the dinning room is crowded, and the tables and chairs are wobbly.  In the past, my stepmother has even asked for different chairs.\\n\\nLast time we went there (prob three years ago) my husband and I were seated upstairs, at a table between two other tables which were abutting the walls.  There was not more than 8 inches between our table and the one on either side of us.  A waiter had to squeeze through several times to get to the tables close to the window before we were even waited on.  That was enough for me.  We left., which I felt awful about, but it was just ridiculous.  Better for them to have left that table out that we were sitting at than to leave it there for the extra revenue. \\n\\nBottom line: very good food, just can't stand the crowdedness of the place.

Finally had the chance to check this once-a-month feature SL holds every first Wednesday (where an established customer takes along someone who's never been to take advantage of the BOGO offering (buy one, get one).  I was told that this feature applies only towards spa services, but that I'd be able to take Mom in so that we'd both be able to get a shampoo/cut and color.\\n\\nNow, first I have to say that my first coloring (Feb.) didn't last very long- I noticed fading within the first two weeks!  I thought perhaps using another color-enhancing shampoo/conditioner set after one week of religious use of Aveda products may have been the culprit (perhaps chemicals in the second set caused color to fade), but after discussing it with Rachael, I decided I'd use more expensive color-safe products, shampoo less (I normally wash my hair twice a day on the days I work, and at least once-a-day on my days off), AND rinse with cold water after every shower to ensure that the hair cuticles properly close, but no... Mom and I BOTH noticed significant color fading WITHIN the FIRST week of the treatment.\\n\\nOther disappointments include Mom's complaint of uneven shearing of her hair; my slight disappointment in the way my hair \\\"moves\\\" with the new haircut; the very small pool area out back, and the lack of privacy we encountered compared to the other spas we've experienced while accessing the pool, sauna, and steam rooms, to name a few.  To add insult to injury, the receptionist decided to skip me and take care of the group of older women behind me when it came time to pay.  After a few minutes, when she was ready to direct her attention to me, the receptionist first tried to charge double for the services- basically negating the BOGO offer, but I reminded her that we were there for \\\"Live at Lamar,\\\" so she then tried to do a \\\"buy one, get 50% off the second\\\" deal, to which I again balked at.  I also added a couple of hair products to my bill, and...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

They had a \\\"tech\\\" come out who said there was no leak from the plumbing. I had another contractor look at it and water was leaking out the back of the shower fixture! The VP of the company Janet Gilbert insisted the leak wasn't due to the shower despite never being in my home to see it herself. She insisted I didn't pay them for their \\\"tech\\\" to come out even though I have a copy of my check and signed contract from them saying I paid in full. It was because \\\"I didn't pay\\\" that she felt she could hang up on me and say we don't have a good business relationship? I pay all my bills/responsibilities on time. I have never seen such a response from any service-sector business before, especially when people are dying for good business in this terrible economy. BEWARE, hiring this company will most definitely mean problems, see this as a grave warning sign. I have read many reviews on this and other websites, and this is supposed to be one of those red-flags to look out for or be sorry!\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nIts only an Arbys. So this will only be a quick review.\\n\\n No matter where we live in Las Vegas we have an Arbys within a 10 minute drive. Years ago, Arbys left the New York City market. Now that they opened a store in Bellmore, NY; New Yorkers are driving a distance for the Arbys experience. The Arbys of today is a different restaurant than I remember in New York. They greatly eliminated their popular signature menu items for new market fresh items. Maybe the Wendy's merger had something to do with it. Delicious menu items like the super beacon roast beef and cheeseburger (they had delicious cheeseburgers) have been replaced by reubens, roast turkey, and other market sandwiches that remind me more of Wendys. \\n\\nFortunately,  they still serve the beacon cheddar roast beef sandwich. That is my Arby's sandwich of choice. My critique is that they not charge an extra dollar for more roast beef.\\n\\n  This Arbys shares the parking lot with Pecos Legacy Car Wash. After scrubbing off presents from pigeons and the elements,  eating here is a nice reward for hand washing my car. Thats all I have to say.\\n\\nYelp Challenge: Review 41 of 100.\n\nReview rating:",

        "They say the omelets are large here and they sure as hell aren't exaggerating. I came here with a large party and several of us were determined to finish their omelettes in one sitting. I was not among that company. Just getting through 2/3 of this monstrosity took an absurd amount of effort. \\n\\nI went with the cowboy, which is basically beef chilli and cheese in an already enormous (must be at least 4  or more eggs) contraption. The chilli is tasty- I had no problem wolfing it down. Bit of advice-- If you are feeling a bit of health guilt and opt for the wheat toast as I did, make sure to ask for it UNBUTTERED or else you will be treated to two gelatinous slabs of what used to be a healthy side dish. I can't say I was impressed with the fried potatotes-- they were extremely greasy and soft. In other words, not appetizing at all. Our party ordered some fried zucchini as well which came with some tasty ranch, and some not so appealing nacho cheese like substance.\\n\\nOur waitress was pretty friendly however, and I thought the coffee wasn't bad. And in terms of restaurants in vegas, this place is bordering on iconic-- it's a known landmark on Charleston and is often frequented by Old Vegas money. The selection is very impressive-- they basically have an omelette for every possible taste preference you can think of. If you're in the mood for a hearty dance with the devil to start off your day, this is your spot.\nSo I would like to give it",

I ordered a simple rice, bean and guacamole ($6.95) burrito for lunch.  I mean, how hard can that be to MESS up?  \\n\\nBut they piled some warm slimy goop (frijoles, I imagine) in a tortilla and called it done.  I have heard this location has been several other ill-fated restaurants before.  Let's hope this one can stay a while.  Lunch service was slower than expected - only 2 servers but with 10 parties.\\n\\nTheir signature dish was the poco pollo - basically a chicken chimi with heart clogging jalapeno cream cheese - a standard dish at most Mexican eateries.  Might be worth it - who knows? The inside decor is nice a warm modern Mexican look, but with booths and cheap tables/chairs throughout.  They also serve tequila and margaritas yet have NO BAR.

        "After reading the reviews of this place on here and on beer advocate I was really looking forward to this place. Once I got there the place was not at all what I was expecting. Kind of a strange place with a deli, convenience store, beer/wine store, and a small bar/eating area. They had a few good beers on tap, and a ton of good bottled beer as well. \\n\\nThat being said, the place seems a little disorganized, and there is not much in the way of seating. I had a question or two about some of the beers, and the employee that I talked to seemed to be annoyed that I had the nerve to bother him. Really the only thing that the place had going for it was the beer selection, and I would rather stick with Brawleys, especially given the difference in the level of service between the two...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "For a Marriott, this place sure did disappoint. We've stayed at many other Marriott's and their affiliates in the greater Phoenix area, and this one was by far the saddest we have stayed at. Beside being built into a mountain, that's about all there is to \\\"ooh and ahh\\\" about.\\n\\nTerrible experience from the moment we pulled up to register. While the staff was welcoming, they offered no extra information or anything about their hotel. \\n\\nAfter driving around the hotel to come to our room, not even being offered valet service for our car, we dragged our suitcases up the elevator and through a most aggravating hallway, where we arrived to the saddest part of all, the room.\\n\\nThe room looked run down and cheap. It's 107 degrees in Arizona currently in June, and when we got in the door the air was off. I'm sorry, but if you know a specific room will be accommodating guests, wouldn't you have the air on? At least on a low setting?  The sliding bathroom door wouldn't close, the illuminated magnifying mirror didn't illuminate and a whole host of other things. Most of all, the thing that disappointed us most was that we paid for a room with a patio and a view, and we got a patio that faces a gate that was on a landing that takes you to the pool. And the view... the landing pool for the slide. Wow! NOT. \\n\\nWe called down to the front desk to see if they have wifi in the room, and the lady I spoke to hadn't the slightest clue. We knew we had paid for a room with internet included, otherwise it's $14.95 a night. She insisted the only way to connect was with the Ethernet cord, and no other way. She was clueless. So after a couple minutes of confused banter, she transferred me to Internet services, which answered the question in about 2 seconds. Needless to say, yes, they do have wifi. \\n\\nSadly, after reaching out to the Marriott customer service line and management about our disappointment, the only thing they could offer us was to fix the problems in our room and a complimentary breakfast buffet. Whatever.\\n\\nFor...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "The exterior of the building might be unappealing but once you step in it's whimsical and cheerful. This is a Family Owned Sinaloan Style Seafood Restaurant that is open every day for lunch and dinner.\\n\\nRight away they gave us house made chips , the daily made green guacamole style salsa and the spicier red salsa. They are delicious and differ from other salsas I've tried elsewhere and I only tried a few and then they presented Mini Complementary Tostada Ceviches and gosh they were excellent and were better in taste (not quality of fish)  than some I've tried at high end dinning destinations paying maybe the same as my whole meal here and these were FREE here. \\n\\nI always enjoy the fish veracruzana with vegetables but this time tried the fish with poblano peppers , onions and tomatoes. Both these dishes I can tell you are as tasty as can be. The fish filet is mild and fresh with a feather light batter that is not oily being the lightest batter I have ever seen on a delicate fresh fish. For me what makes these dishes so great is the delicious well made light sauces they are in. Also included are very soft fresh tasting tortillas and on the platter was salad , refried beans and a white rice with mixed vegetables that is yummy from the sauce of your dish. All this food I got was only $13.00 It was not good but very good.\\n\\nWhile we were dining I noticed most people were ordering what looked like a steaming large cauldron of mixed grilled meats and fish , I found out this dish is called Malcajete and it looked great to try.\\n\\nThey offer many variations of fish , steamed , grilled , battered, and breaded with a variety of sauces. Very little in the way of chicken or beef but they do have some.\\n\\nIt's a small family run business so when they get busy sometimes they go down a bit I noticed on a visit after I wrote this Yelp.\\n\\n3.5-5 stars My rating for this place is",

For what one gets, the prices are on the high side. The menus are sometimes food-splattered and the windows to the outside dining area are not clean.

It's also unfair to review this on what it will be - since it isn't that yet. \\n\\nToday, it's a mall I rarely visit. Apart from a few stores I would visit out of convenience or necessity, there's not much to offer compared to what it used to have. The fantastic movie theater, Jutenhoops, Alpine Ski Keller, Bear Cover, and even Ed Debevics are all long gone... oops, there I go bringing up the past. Seriously though, these were painful to lose - one by one.\\n\\nSo today, there's a Linens 'n' Things which is hardly unique, and a Trader Joe's which is nice to have in the area, and also a Sister's Attic and Closet upscale thrift stores which add a bit of much-needed flavor. The Chili's, the Bookstar, and Black Angus are still around. So is the jewelry store that has never really offered a compelling reason to enter. They've wedged an LA Fitness here and they've also added a Blimpie and an Arby's... all very healthy choices. \\n\\nBesides all of the generic shops and eateries and standard offerings, there's still a few unique experiences - though nothing like it used to... shit, there I go again. Anyway, so there's a few places that aren't screaming \\\"standard mall\\\" such as Pita Grill, a pipe and tobacco shoppe (you have to spell it that way in this case), a place to get eyewear, and some other small and uninteresting businesses. \\n\\nIn that sense, I suppose this is has become a decent and convenient neighborhood strip mall. This is a shame really since it's lacking most of the key elements that made it really special. It's still a beautiful outdoor mall and the architecture alone makes it a unique alternative to the cookie-cutter malls that strategically litter the landscape of America. \\n\\nI'm worried about what they'll do to the architecture when they renovate this place someday, but I think the fact that this mall isn't terribly interesting anymore in general means it won't be so terribly missed...\n\nReview rating:",

Then our food came my file is really good I ate the whole thing..\\n\\nSo besides the yucky calamari and the rude lady my experience was alright but I would never come back again!!!\\n\\nPS.

The Parmesan chicken was not cooked well - it was like a giant gelatinous chicken nugget. The brick chicken didn't taste fresh. It was like a fast food chicken with that really dried out taste. I can't describe it but it was like the graininess of processed chicken. I really supported this place for over a year, but their quality has noticeably dropped. The salad was meager - I mean very small. The staff was profusely nice; the managers were very apologetic, but I begged them to understand that the quality of the chicken was just low - not their preparation.\n\nStars:",

I always feel uncomfortable going to this particular Subway because of the attitudes that I often get from them employees.  Once I got yelled at when I asked if I could substitute a pop / soda instead of a milk for a kids meal.  The employee yelled at me and my nephew screaming and slamming a milk in his hands. He said loudly \\\"No!!  Juice.   juice juice or milk milk milk!!!!;\\\"   often I realize that the employees laugh and talk in a foreign language in front of customers.

It did not look like real poppy seeds. The coffecake had lots of pieces of dough and dry fruit inside. There was barely any poppy seeds in this pastry. It also had a weird chocolaty taste. Maybe they put in a poppy seed substitute... Also, there were lots of things missing. The shelves were pretty empty. They really should order more of the delicious goodies they used to have.

        "My husband and I went to the Chandler office back in April and were not impressed. The staff was not very friendly, the office was outdated, and I didn't see a piece of modern equipment anywhere in the office. After getting xrays and having our teeth examined, they told us that there was tons of work to be done. They told my husband who has only had one cavity in his life, that he needed 3 root canals and all his wisdom teeth pulled. They told me that I needed 4 root canals, replacement of an existing crown and all my wisdom teeth pulled. In total, they quoted us over $5000 worth of dental work. We decided to get a second opinion. When we came to pick up copies of our xrays, the staff was exceptionally rude and hardly acknowledged us before shoving the xrays through the window and then dismissing us.\\n\\nWe just went to the second opinion office tomorrow. It was a world of difference. The damage? Me: 3 fillings, wisdom teeth are fine, no root canals. Husband: 1 root canal, 2 wisdom teeth need pulling the others can wait. They quoted us work totalling a little over $700....yeah that's a big difference. Way more of a difference than one dentist being more aggressive and one being more conservative. This is just outright scamming. Save yourself, stay away from these people.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "I'm glad we made a reservations!  On Wednesday at 8:30pm it was packed, which is a good sign!  We were greeted right away and were taken downstairs to their cozy basement (or cellar I should say).  It is very inviting with wooden ceilings and rafters with alluring stone fireplaces and leather lounge chairs.  I felt like I should be drinking scotch or bourbon down there!  We were seated by our waiter who was quite charming considering the full bar of people chattering away.  I should also note, we were placed in a great spot in the corner where you could observe the busy room or simply enjoy your company as if we were in a room to ourselves.  \\n\\nWe ordered two glasses of wine, and the Mushroom Brie Toast to start.  The toast was pretty unique and tasty, with a variety of mushrooms piled on perfectly toasted French bread with the perfect amount of cheese laced atop. For an entree I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad with a soy vinaigrette.  It was good, with a healthy portion of perfectly cooked ahi, but the salad was kind of boring to me (mixed greens and tomatoes).  The vinaigrette was a bit on the soy-y side for me too...Yes I know that is what the dressing is called; I just expected something a bit more exciting and less salty.  \\n\\nMy date had the NY strip.  It was prepared to temperature and covered in mushrooms, which we probably should have thought of pairing with and alternate appetizer...I think he had his fill of mushrooms for a month hahah!  But it was good nonetheless.  The asparagus was was gone first, so I am assuming it was delicious and the mashed potatoes (came in a little pot on the side) were just kind of boring.  Personally, I would have served the potatoes on the plate with the steak to soak up the wonderful au jus!  \\n\\nAll in all we had a wonderful evening, in a great atmosphere, with great service and good food.

        "Tried the location at Hilldale awhile ago, way better than this place. Came in on a Sunday for brunch, started off ordering a bloody mary which had to be made with their garlic infused tequila because they were out of vodka (what?). The menu described the $8 drink as garnished with lots of toppings, when I got it, it had a lemon and lime. I took one sip and discovered tequila is not meant for bloodies, so I asked for a coke in return. We were told we wouldn't be charged for the bloody, but once the check came and the $8 for it was still included, our server told us it couldn't be removed from the bill because it had been made, but to take it off of his tip (again, what?).\\n\\nFood was decent, but my order was messed up and I was already feeling too needy to have it sent back. Also a bit pricey - chips and salsa aren't included with meals. I would not go back to this location.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nThis review is for the Sears Auto Center at this location.  Manager Rich Kuzma and staff were very helpful when I came in with a tire problem (which turned out to be a bent rim).  They rotated all my tires (free of charge bec/ I had bought the tires at Sears), changed the oil, and checked each of them for leaks.  Rich then gave me the location of a parts yard where I could find a replacement rim on the cheap.  I went, found a rim, brought it back to Sears the same day, and they tried to change it out before realizing I had picked out the wrong size rim.  As a last resort, one of the employees bent the rim back to its original shape so well that even Rich was impressed.  Turns out I have not had to replace the rim since.  And again, no charge for all the labor.  Great service.  Highly recommend.\n\nStars:",

A solid 3.5 stars.\\n\\nThe restaurant is nicely decorated, and we had excellent service as well.  While I enjoy the hole-in-the wall places with the best Mexican food, sometimes I want to read a menu that doesn't offer me the opportunity to sample the food the last patrons spilled all over it.  And sometimes I want to use a restroom that has actually been cleaned in the last month.  For this I sacrifice great food for good food on occasion and Ajo Al's fits the bill.\nSo I would like to give it",

Total was $18 and change. The pasta was so dry I could barely eat it! Where's the alfredo sauce? Definitely no breadstick dunking. Not even enough to coat half the pasta. And 2 breadsticks was it. For $20 bucks this was very disappointing. The only reason I gave 2 stars was the soup was good.  Never again will I order pickup from this restaurant,  and I'm probably going to have to find another convenient Italian place. Bummer. My rating for this place is",

After work it's loud and crowded and energetic - exactly as it should be. \\n\\nWhat I really wish is that the kitchen staff were able to produce quality food to go along with that ambiance. I ordered one of my favorite comfort food dishes - cottage pie. What I was served was: sparse ground beef, frozen mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce topped with processed whipped potatoes. I know they were frozen mixed vegetables because I really don't think corn is typically used in cottage pie... It's just not that hard to make cottage pie (or shepherd's pie with lamb) even in a restaurant environment. \\n\\nStick with a Jameson's or Guinness after work and move elsewhere for dinner.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nThis used to be our go-to place for lake perch in the Madison area, but things have been slipping a bit lately in the food quality and portion department.  I consistently get the steak and lake perch and the last few times I've had it, the steak has been perfectly cooked to order.  The lake perch has been the downfall for me, though.  The fish tastes like freezer to me and always has tons of bones in it.  I would much rather go to the Avenue for lake perch.  Always get a baked potato, and it's hard to ruin that.   Salad is nothing to write home about - just a bowl of lettuce, but I do like their French dressing.  Rolls are always cold with rock hard butter.  I noticed last night that I had two fewer pieces of perch than I normally get.  Husband always gets the lake perch dinner and he loves it, but I think his tastebuds are slipping in old age.  We love that they are so good to our toddler here and they give out a treat to little ones at the end of the meal.  Service is usually prompt, but last night it was severely lacking even though it was slow with several open tables.  Took us 1.5 hours between ordering and finishing the meal, which is unacceptable.  Waitress made several errors with our orders, took 20 minutes to get white milk, drinks sat empty for 20 minutes as well.  Tip for those who want to try it - avoid the extremely busy Fridays and go later on a Saturday.  You can still order lake perch (although I told my husband that we will only go to the Avenue from now on after last night's debacle).\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "THE WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  THEY ARE BUTCHERS!  My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The \\\"dentist\\\" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with \\\"you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth\\\". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this \\\"bone graft\\\". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The \\\"dentist\\\" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions.  I was in...\nSo I would like to give it",

I wouldn't recommend them.  \\n\\nWe sat outside on the patio, which was very pleasant. There are a bunch of bars/restaurants on this little strip and it's a bit secluded. So, it felt like we were in a small neighborhood, not in the middle of uptown.  I definitely recommend sitting on the patio if the weather permits. The inside seemed a bit dated and stuffy. \\n\\nOur waitress was very friendly and she knew the menu well (which I always appreciate). We went on a Wednesday, so the wine was half-off! The selection is limited, but I enjoyed the discount.  \\n\\nI definitely recommend this place. The chicken wings alone are worth the trip.

My hair is long, thick, and curly. So I found Modern Salon just a few blocks away from my hotel. When I first got there the lady that took care of me was very polite even after she realized that blow-drying my hair would take a lifetime. She scurried of to speak to her supervisor or maybe a more experienced stylist for suggestions on what products or brushes to use. Nikki came along and was extremely knowledgeable with my textured type of hair; she had an amazing attitude not only to satisfy the customer but also towards the not so experienced stylist, they are lucky to have her as a mentor. I don't usually write reviews but after the experience I had at that salon I think it's worth writing a review to mention the professionalism and the positive attitude of the salon. I did mention to Nikki this is probably the first time I've ever had anyone \\\"understand\\\" my hair. She didn't take forever to blow dry my hair because she knew what she was doing. I wish I could have taken her back home to DC, but she suggested a really good stylist in this area. :)\n\nReview rating:",

I understand why you are a Triple A Five Diamond Reward and voted as Forbes Five Star Award restaurant...not only are you very crafty, creative and detailed with your culinary dishes but also your attention to art and how you integrated it with the atmosphere and whole dining experience. This place has all the feel of being..Native American? Well it is on a Indian Reserve....but it's like really fancy Native American decor...they have different paintings for each menu...and the waiter told us that it changes every time so even when you go back you'll see a different painting on the menu. The menu is also cleverly named too...instead of appetizer, small bites, and entree...they replaced it with \\\"the birth\\\", \\\"the beginning\\\" and \\\"the journey\\\" each corresponding to the amount of food each one serves. I'm giving it 4 stars for the atmosphere alone. =)  \\n\\nMy bf made reservations at this place for 5:45pm but we were stuck in traffic for a while and my bf gave them a call telling them we would be a little late..this place is located in a far off resort and spa of Wild Horse Pass..not that easy to find but it's really nice and quiet around this area in Chandler.\\n\\nWhen we arrived the hostess referred to us as Mr. and Mrs. Li....I was about to correct her but my bf thought it would be funny just to say yes..haha so the whole night they just referred to us as Mr. Li or Mrs. Li..  Oi one thing I notice throughout the whole night is that -- there are NO YOUNG people here....my bf and I were the youngest couple here....other people were at least 40 and above. This is a pricey restaurant.....but why no young people here on Friday night? I guess they rather spend $$$$ at clubs or something..hehe maybe not just saying.\\n\\nWell let's get on with the food review, shall we? They served us three selections of some pretty good breads and olive oil to start off with..then they gave us each a tablespoon of chef's special dumplings with toasted parsley and after that we got Guava sherbet with Pomegranate...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

You also get hot Korean tea with your meal. Ordered the loco moco and got a nice sized hamburger patty on top of a huge mound of rice and topped with an egg and lots of gravy, Also had to try a side of Spam, which was grilled to perfection but a little too salty for me. The loco moco was just like the ones I had in Hawaii, though. The kimchi was great, especially the one that has been fermenting for a while, although it has a huge bite, so watch out when you are eating it. The regular kimchi was very good as were the pickled radishes. The staff makes you feel like you are in the islands with their laid back attitude and attentive service.

I've been going to China Chili since it's original location on Central and Osborn and followed it like many of its fans to its much larger location which accommodates all of its patrons.\\n\\nI don't usually bother writing reviews for places that have over 50 reviews but after reading some of the reviews, I want to set things straight.\\n\\nFirst of all, I've been to the Chinese Cultural Center and am not a fan whatsoever.  China Chili blows the Cultural Center out of the water.\\n\\nThe beauty of China Chili (and only you regulars know this), they will make everything made-to-order.  In other words, if you want white meat only, with just light sauce and medium spice, they will do it just like that and deliver it steaming hot to your table within 5 minutes.  \\n\\nThe wait staff, if you get to know them, are extremely nice, kind and so sweet.  They may not be too chatty but don't take it personal. \\n\\nSo next time, if you want your Chinese food in a certain way, just ask.  They will give you exactly what you want.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review: Last summer, to kick off a west coast road trip, my family and I flew out to Phoenix, where our trip would commence. We arrived in Phoenix at around 9:30 am local time, and by the time we picked up our luggage and rental car, it was almost 11 am. Since we flew over from the east coast and had not eaten since early that morning, we were ridiculously hungry. However, that day also happened to be the day of the highly anticipated US-England World Cup soccer match, so we also wanted to watch the game. In need of a site with food and televisions, we decided to look for a sports bar or pub. But I guess just about everyone in Phoenix wanted to watch the soccer game at a bar, too, because all of the sports bars that we passed by were full. Who knew that Arizonans (or Americans, for that matter) followed soccer? Anyway, long story short, our search kept turning up duds until our GPS navigated us to Rodehouse Restaurant. The nearly empty restaurant, large televisions, and our groaning stomachs all conspired to pull us into the restaurant. My jubilation at finally getting a chance to sit down and eat quickly vanished when I noticed that, though the game was not even 10 minutes old at that point, England was already up 1-0. Sigh.\\n\\nAnyway, about the restaurant: we ordered a couple of burgers and salads. The Cobb salad was actually pretty large and substantial, containing a good amount of chicken, egg, avocado, bacon, and cheese. The chili cheeseburger, a behemoth of a burger, was tasty, as the thick, hearty chili definitely hit the spot. Messy, but damn tasty. Oh, and the Tavern Fries (I think that's what they were called) served with the burgers were good as well. All in all, the food was solid, but nothing blew my mind away. \\n\\nWe stayed for the duration of the game, giving a large whoop when the US tied game on Dempsey's goal courtesy of the English keeper's gaffe. The waiter was nice and didn't mind that my family and I lingered at the restaurant for the length of the game, long after we had finished our meals, so...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Used tongs to add the onion and then fingers to break them apart.  No handwashing at any point.  \\n\\nWhen I went to open the mustard bottle, it was so caked with dried mustard, I had to ask for another bottle because it was just too gross to use.  \\n\\nWatched a young man roll silverware in napkins...touched all areas of the utensils and a couple of times scratched himself and went right back to rolling those utensils up.\nSo I would like to give it",

I had lunch here last week, and had some sort of pasta with meat sauce with a touch of cream.  i don't remember what it was called.  The penne were sort of chewy, and the meat sauce tasted kind of like prego.  I think prego tastes okay, but my \\\"fancy\\\" restaurant meal shouldn't taste like it.  I wished I had ordered the squash ravioli.  \\n\\nMy boyfriend had some sort of pasta with an chicken alfredo sauce and bread crumbs on the top. I had a bite, and i didn't think it tasted like anything.  He thought it wasn't any different than some garbage from the Olive Garden, but I disagree.  The Olive Garden is awful.  This wasn't terrible, it was just bland.\\n\\nThe bread basket was good, and the waiter was super attentive.  I guess overall, it all sort of struck me as \\\"generic\\\".\n\nStars:",

        "Historic, yes. Worth the visit, no.\\n\\nProblem 1: Hosting a political event without warning during the Saturday lunch hour.  No signs on the outside, no warning until we're in and heading for the table, and we realize, \\\"There's a guy, stumping for Mayor of Phoenix, and he's going to just talk the entire lunch hour.\\\"  So this means we can either enjoy conversation with our friends or we can sit and eat quietly while an unelected politician tells us why we shouldn't trust elected politicians.\\n\\nProblem 2: Very dry chicken.  Seriously, I think they stuck a frozen Wal-Mart chicken breast in the microwave and nuked it for 8 minutes or something.  How hard is it to make a chicken sandwich taste good?  So now I get to try to choke down dry chicken and terrible political speeches at the same time.\\n\\nProblem 3:  The candidate finally quits talking.  Then he takes a photo standing between the waitresses and says, \\\"It's like beauty on the outside, and beast on the inside.\\\"  No one laughs.  But then the owner comes up to our table as we're finally getting the chance to talk to each other, and she spends another 15 minutes telling us why we should vote for a certain party and why she wants to move into Phoenix from her home in Fountain Hills.  My favorite line: \\\"We need to make it harder for folks to drive so that they start using public transportation.\\\"  But of course, she's not using the light rail on her way in from Fountain Hills.  She just wants the people off her streets when she's trying to drive in and out of the city.\\n\\nThe only good thing about the whole trip--apart from our friends, who are awesome--was that the waitresses were professional and competent.  They earned a good tip and they treated us well.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

We tried to order a pitcher of the IPA and the waitress stops us and is like do you like IPAS? do you know what your ordering? i was like yes i like IPAS im capable of ordering a beer like a grown up. maybe next time be like hey our ipa is exceptionally hoppy compared to other ipas, is that alright for you? After finally ordering a pitcher of beer (there were six of us, so four of us had one beer) the waitress tells us that it is such a high gravity, she says 9% that if any of us have more than three she'll have to start figuring out who the DD is and maybe cut people off. Not only was it an uncomfortable comment, but we looked back at the menu and the beer was only 5.7%. Needless to say none of us wanted to order another round of drinks. Then when the waitress brought out our chili, she told us that the green onions looked nasty and she didn't feel comfortable serving them. I was kind of grossed out by that point. Couldn't you have just lied to me and told me you were out? I don't wanna hear about nasty things in the kitchen, it made me really not want to eat.

There was a closed sign on the door.  Then we saw it again across the river so we went there......well they were moving all right and were not set up for business.  I walked in and they were sitting around relaxing for a while and I said I was so sorry they were not open for business.  We chatted some and I thanked them and headed back to the car.  Then suddenly out comes one of the guys and tells us to come back in; they said they have some in the freezer that they moved in the morning.   They asked what flavor and we said we didn't care so they brought us each cappuccino.  We sat down on something and ate our ice cream and chatted.  We tried to pay but they wouldn't accept any money.  The owner is so nice and friendly, oh and yes the ice cream was delicious.

        "So, we were hungry after visiting the Heard Museum, and I had just found out I had $50 on my All Access card from the ridiculous amount of money we spend at the Honolulu Hard Rock a year and a half ago, so we decided to go.  It was a Sunday and downtown Phoenix was dead....as was the Hard Rock Cafe.  It just felt kind of depressing.  Service was a bit slow, my Margarita was blue and the food was so-so.  Then I found out the $50 on my card could not be used towards alcohol....which made up over 50% of our bill.  Oh well.  Had a lot more fun and the Honolulu one, but that's probably because we were on vacation.  :)\nSo I would like to give it",

The food is not super greasy or full of crazy amounts of that fake testing Chinese food seasoning some of the restaurants put in (I don't know what it is...but there are some of you right now who know what I'm talking about!). \\n\\nThey are not overly helpful on the phone but in the many times we've ordered (over 6 years), they've never messed up on an order, are always within 30 minutes of a delivery time, and deliver HOT. \\n\\nWe recommend the orange chicken, the vegetable lo mein, and any form of tofu--especially the tofu cashew (as a nice vegetarian option). I see that some people say there aren't veggie options but as a family that is primarily vegetarian, they've substituted tofu in every dish without complaint. And will make just about any dish you ask. They may not appear to be excited about doing it but then again, I don't think they get excited about anything....They just do what they do--Make good, fast, hot Chinese food.

        "My coworkers and I stayed at the Phoenix Airport Marriott hotel in Phoenix, Arizona in March 2012. I was sharing a room with two other female colleagues and were appalled at the service we received during our stay. We were already upset with being relocated from the Renaissance Downtown Hotel a few days prior to attending the conference and the awful customer service provided by the hotel added to our negative overall experience with the Marriott franchise. \\n\\nEarly Tuesday morning, two men came pounding at our door at 2 a.m. They identified themselves as a security guard and a worker at the hotel. They stated that this was our second warning and demanded that we open the door. This was quite alarming being that we never received a first warning for anything and were sincerely concerned about our safety. \\n\\nWhen we called the front desk to inquire if the two men standing outside were part of the staff of the hotel and to explain to guest services that we should have received a phone call from guest services in the first place, a guest relations worker by the name of Caroline asked us if we planned to continue with the noise level and responded with an unwarranted attitude that there was laughter heard from our room and someone in the room next to us called to complain. We were taken aback by her attitude because while we would have been more than happy to bring our noise level down, we did not expect a representative from guest services to be the one to talk back or respond to us in a matter that was rude and unnecessary when all we wanted to do was to explain to her about our concerns because we did not feel safe. We were extremely alarmed by the way the hotel handled the situation because we felt like our privacy was violated and our safety was jeopardized by these two strangers demanding us to open the door at 2 a.m. To make matters worse, when we brought this issue to the attention of the Front Office Manager, Camille Cobos, she simply made no effort to be apologetic or explain to us why this situation...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Hey trust me when i tell you....you will receive 5 star treatment at this midas on Bell road. Located only about 1 min off SR51 here in phoenix...it is you one stop destination for everything that is ailing your car, truck, van, SUV, or motorcycle. I remember when I first moved out here in Feb..I had some serious issues going on with my 1999 Jeep Cherokee classic. My wife and sister-in-law drove our Jeep from Chicago Illinois, more than 2000 miles, and I have to say it made it all the way with no troubles to speak of. \\n\\nHowever upon arriving in Arizona, i noticed a few days later that the check engine light was on....and i knew i needed to rectify any problems i was having with the Jeep before i took it for it's emission test out here. Well to make a long story short...being new out here i didn't know who to trust to fix my Trucks....also own a 2004 Chevy Colorado....and i had heard some true horror stories about how car mechanics try to swindle you out of thousands of dollars out here.\\n\\nSo since i needed an Oil change i decided to go to Midas and at least get that done since they were offering to rotate the tires as well all for only 19.99. While i was there i had them check out the check engine light...and check for anything else that was wrong with the Jeep  again before i took it for the emission test. I have to tell you it was the best decision i have made for my trucks since i arrived here. \\n\\nBob Ostercamp who is the manager at this location has consistently given my great deals on all my automotive repairs. He is honest, direct, straightforward, and most importantly he cares how your vehicle runs. He has a great staff of certified mechanics and you can trust they will always do the very best job. This location gets a lot of repeat business because of all these factors.\\n\\nSo if your ever in need for honest, reliable, and great service please visit these guys...i promise you...you won't be sorry. Take Care my friends!!!!! My rating for this place is",

The story this time is that my dog was adopted at the Henderson Animal Shelter nearby my girlfriend's school. Being that her school is right next to this shelter it seemed the most logical thing to do since it also had very positive reviews on Yelp. \\n\\nThe pup had a slight cough and the vet told me it could possibly be kennel cough, but to not to worry about it. The only thing they recommended me to do was to check for worms (which they promptly notified me he had none). A few days later the pup stopped eating, wasn't moving well, and the bowels movements ceased to exist. Took him for another visit a few days later (clear across town I might add) and turns out his kennel cough could have developed to either pneumonia or canine distemper. That... sucks, my poor pup.\\n\\nThe vet came back into the room with fees costing $700 to $1200 depending on how long he had to stay with the vet. Wow. I was definitely in a shock for that, and honestly could not really afford that, so instead I opted for them to give him antibiotic injections and IV fluids. I took the prescription paper to get pet meds (on average cost $90 total) nearby my house (turns out other vets don't want to take competing clinic's prescriptions, fantastic). Force fed my dog for 3 days and gave him lots of TLC. A month later he's all better, running around pooping and peeing everywhere.\\n\\nWhile the clinic was definitely professional and prompt with their service I am definitely weary now of trusting a vets medical advice.\nSo I would like to give it",

Our eye was drawn across the street to an interesting sign and full parking lot so we decided to give Las Islitas a try. We were very pleased to see the full restaurant and friendly staff when we came in the door. We were seated quickly and placed an order. While waiting for our meal we enjoyed the mariachi band and took in the decor, very nice. Amanda's oysters came out quickly along with my shrimp Ceviche tostada, both were very good. We've enjoyed their shrimp tacos, burritos, and shrimp diablo. There are flat screens on usually set to football games or news, and the juke box can be a bit loud at times but all in all it's well worth it!\n\nReview rating:",

They were out of oysters. \\n\\nMajor bummer, as we had a party of 8 and we were visiting from out of town and went just for the oysters... regardless, we ordered the seafood sampler and the table had a variety of other things. \\n\\nThe seafood was drenched in butter, which of course makes everything taste good, however, the seafood was just ok. Crab was super small and there wasn't much of it.\\n\\nThe rest of our party was very disappointed- they felt like their meals were overly breaded and tasted the same, so much so, they all got sick of their meals before finishing them.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "It's been a long time since we were here.  I remember this being at least a 4-star place.  But based on this visit, I can't really go over 3-star.\\n\\nBy looks, the ambiance is fine.  \\\"Looks Japanese\\\".  But they play contemporary rock.  Doesn't fit.  It was enough that I noticed it, which isn't great.\\n\\nWe couldn't do tepanyaki (my first choice) because they had a \\\"large party coming\\\".  Several people showed-up, but there were still several griddle/tables available.  I assume they didn't have enough chefs to staff them, but don't really know.  If the room had been filled it would have been easier to shrug my shoulders and accept they had reserved the space.  But it wasn't, so it was a bit annoying.\\n\\nSo we grabbed a table.  We could have grabbed seats at the sushi bar, but we wanted some hot food too.  We ordered a few sushi rolls, and one stir-fried (I assume) beef and vegetable dish (I think it was called Yakiniki).\\n\\nThe rolls were fine.  Nothing really special.  Better than you get pre-packaged in a grocery, certainly.  But I've had better in other restaurants.  Not as good as I remember last time I was here, but maybe my memory is fooling me.  Given the pricing, it should be better.  Again, they were fine.  But not \\\"wonderful\\\".\\n\\nThe beef dish was disappointing.  Not much beef.  LOTS of mushrooms, plus some other veggies.  Sauce was nothing special.  Not bad, but I wouldn't order it again.\\n\\nAll in all, an unextraordinary meal.  It was fine.  But not as good as I remember, nor as good as I would expect for a place that charges what Ninja charges.\\n\\nGlad I had a Groupon.  Helped defray my actual out-of-pocket, so that was nice.\\n\\nIf the service had been better I might be able to give 3.5 stars.  But service was inattentive, and inconsistent.  Sometimes it was cheerful, and other times it was impatient.  From the same server over a matter of 10 minutes.  Very strange.  So three stars it is.  I would not avoid this place, but I won't make a point of eating here again either.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I was a bit surprised at all the \\\"extra\\\" costs that went on top of the ticket prices. At shows, the performers ask for tips. The latte was expensive, and husband said that turkey leg was to. We were with someone who had gone before, and she mentioned that she thought they had dropped the prices.  Had the tickets not been free, the cost would have been very high.  On the good side, at least the parking was included.  On a slightly different note, I saw a lot more flesh from people, and could have done without. \\n\\nSunblock, sunglasses, water, and comfortable shoes are required for this.  It was a windy day, so the dust was certainly blowing.  If your kids are younger than three, I'd say to wait.

I will say that they did have a separate hibachi dining area so I can't comment on that part...although I wouldn't expect much after our experience.  The decor is very tired and not that clean.   The staff was pleasant although certainly not Japanese.   We sat at the sushi bar and continued to have waitresses and waiters grab their sushi orders from over our heads between us even though there was an open station side for this purpose...they just don't get it. Sushi was not fresh, tempura was cold, and miso soup was salty.  We went to a mall after and went through the food court- we would have rather eaten at any of these places over Ginza.

I'm sure this place is better than what I experienced but I probably won't give it a 2nd chance and here's why.\\n\\nOur waiter was so dull & clueless.  I seriously think he must be a relative they HAD to employ.  I know it's not a dream job but he really looked upset to be there.  Whenever I go to a new place I always ask what dish makes their restaurant worth coming back for... you know, what do people tend to favor.  He had no clue how to answer this.  I asked if they had any drink specials & he said no.  Turns out they had Sangria (which I usually like), but I didn't order it b/c I had already ordered a beer.  He was rushing us to order.  If I had more time we would have ordered an appetizer, but I guess he prefer we spend less.  I asked for green enchiladas, instead I got red.  He could only do one thing at a time.  When he brought our order, instead of clearing our table to make room for the plates, he just plopped down the meals on top of the dishes already there - making a lot of noise and making things flop all around.\\n\\nI saw dishes on other people's tables that looked better than ours, which only made me blame the waiter more for rushing us.\\n\\nWhile it may not be fair to judge this entire restaurant because of one waiter, the fact that they let this guy work in public makes me question anything this place does.\\n\\nBut what about the food?...  very mediocre.  My favorite part of the meal was the beans... pretty sad.\n\nReview rating:",

The wine list is good, not great,  the food is good and yes it is cool the setting and all that shit. I like atmosphere but this place has to many super cool, dressed in black tops, designer jeans, and mules, for me personally. I want wine aficionados not people who order house wine and want to look cool in the cars they work for and the apartment that is not furnished. When this place first opened i loved it but it is now a bit falsetto for my taste. My rating for this place is",

The dipping sauce was pretty good though.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the red bean shaved ice. It was okay. The flavor was decent and reminded me of red beans and rice.

        "Review text:\nI've eat'n here a few times over the last couple of years and have been very pleased with both the food and service every time.  I most recently was there on this past Saturday, which I don't recommend showing up on a Saturday without reservations,  we got the last two seats at the bar and were lucky to get those.  We ordered the pasta special and it was amazing.  It was shrimp and crab ravioli in a white wine sauce, cooked with asparagus, roasted yellow peppers, and mushrooms.  It was probably the best ravioli I ever had.  It was topped with four huge pieces of shrimp cooked to perfection.  Most meals come with either soup or salad, either is guaranteed to be delicious, and some bread served with olive oil for dipping.  Some other things I've had that I really enjoyed were the spaghetti and meatball, the hot anti-pasta, and their fudge.  Everything has a very home cooked feel to it, better than mom used to make.  They also use the freshest of ingredients, the secret to any good Italian meal.  The service here is very good too, and very friendly.  If you want a good home cooked Italian meal and warm, friendly atmosphere, this is the place for you.\n\nReview rating:",

It has a patio, bar with several TV screens tuned to sports, and a large set of booths for the anyone who wants.\\n\\nThe service was rapid and friendly by pretty waitresses.  I had a spicy salad one night and grilled salmon on another.  Both had unusual ingredients like toasted corn and were delicious and a great portion size for me.  I will definitely return to this grille for the bar and the rest of the menu.\\n\\nIt seemed like a good place to have a party on the patio, an intimate evening with a date, and anything else.

Right on Tryon St. with a large dining area and excellent patio for people watching or watching the cars go by.\\n\\nI don't remember what I ordered I think it was some sort of BBQ chicken and ribs. The food was pretty average, I didn't get to try the beer but I hear it's quite excellent.

The front room is claustrophobic, and though the back isn't as packed, good luck trying to have a conversation at a normal speaking volume.  Even though I'm only in my mid-twenties, I feel way old and crochety among the people who clog the place.\\n\\nAs other reviewers have said, you can't beat the price of the beer specials here.  The cardiac stix (deep fried provolone sticks) and the spinach artichoke dip (served with deep fried pita bread slices) are pretty decent appetizers to share.  The low prices might encourage you to order more, but the waitstaff can be so elusive that you'll just end up asking for your check the next time you see your server.\\n\\nIf cheap beer and food are your top priorities, and atmosphere matters very little, then Hemingway's will do.  I'd rather walk a little farther from Pitt and go to Panther Hollow Inn near the corner of Forbes and Craig.\n\nReview rating:",

        "I love this place! Some friends and I scheduled an informal whiskey tasting, and the bartender put together a flight for us. He was very knowledgeable about the background/flavors, and was happy to take the time to share his wealth of information. We had people of all different levels of experience, and everyone seemed to enjoy it equally. We also all enjoyed our food. I got the New York Strip Streak special which came with a demi-glaze. It was pretty good, as were the brussels sprouts and mac & cheese that came on the side. The portion was huge, but I was still tempted by the bread pudding for dessert, and it was AMAZING. It came with lots of raisins and was perfectly moist all the way through.\\n\\nIt looks like it would be a fun spot to grab a drink on the weekends too, and I've heard great things about the brunch.

        "Review text:\nI called Greulich's on Greenway and was given an estimate of approximately $280 for replacement of a power steering pump. When I brought the vehicle in I was given a quote of $579 for the same work. I don't expect a phone estimate to be dead accurate but it seemed way out of line. When I questioned it, the price dropped to $289. I had expected a power steering flush to be part of the service but was informed it was an additional $70. After questioning, the flush dropped to $30 because the pump and hoses were already apart. Mike the service writer said it should have a new pulley because the old ones break. I checked with two Ford dealers to see if that was a problem and no one could validate that. Mike the service adviser kept calling me \\\"bud\\\" and \\\"brother\\\"...not very professional and annoying. I was told the car would be done that day. When I called at 5:00 PM the part had not arrived and they would call me back in five minutes. No call back! When I called the next day Mike said the car would be ready at 10:00 AM. I called at 10:00 AM and it was still not ready. The pump they installed was leaking and they would have to order another. Finally at 2:00 PM the repair was done correctly but the pricing confusion and poor follow up make this a place I don't want to visit again.\n\nStars:",

        "I have several accounts with Wells Fargo.  I get one story at my local branch in Sun City, AZ, and then I see a completely different story when I log on to my account from my home computer.  At my local branch, they easily explained monies that are missing from the joint checking account that I share with my husband.  (Attention Ladies:  The way to maintain independence in a marriage is for both you and your husband to have independent accounts with one joint account into which you can deposit money for the electric bill, water bill, gas bill, etc.  That way if your husband wants to go away for a couple of weeks, he can do so with his own money.   You too can take your own independent vacation, )  At my local branch, I was informed that my husband had withdrawn his money from our joint account to set up his own independent checking account.  This is as it should be.  When I looked online at the joint account, the money has just gone missing with the exception of a couple of large withdrawals that my husband made.  I'm not going to feel very confidant in Wells Fargo until I see what my local bank manager is telling me reflected in my online joint account history.\nSo I would like to give it",

Snacks, drinks, a movie theater, billiards...very accommodating and that alone rated the two stars.\\n\\nThe dealer ordered parts on May 22, and, the next day, after $720 and 6 hours of labor, informed me that they were stumped as to the issue and would have to order more parts and spend even more time \\\"figgering out what the heck is wrong\\\" with my bike.  Hmmm, that's not what I expected to hear from a BMW dealer.  \\n\\nThey \\\"guessed\\\" that it \\\"might\\\" be the clutch and that they estimated $2400 in parts and labor, as well as another 2-3 days waiting.  I asked if THAT would get me back on the road. (Remember, they'd already guessed wrong and cost me over $700).

I was looking for a movie that was based on a true story in the Boston area and I was unable to find it, but really didn't expect to, but otherwise I found everything I was looking for, the selection is amazing. If you're looking for something in particular, they WILL have it. theres no way they can't! The prices are excellent as well, I was walking around like I'd never been in a record store and that's probably because I'd never been in one like Manifest! I got to the selection of albums (vinyl!!!! haven't seen them in years!) then spotted the discount room and kept myself from taking off at a run when I spotted stuffed Ted bears on sale for $14.99 (they're $50 where I'm from) my friend just laughed at me when he saw me walking around with that! Tons of Ted stuff, Big Bang Theory, Sons of Anarchy and other popular tv show and movie merchandise. Sunglasses, more stuff than you'll ever need but you have to buy!!! the 2 for a dollar CD's and DVD's in the sale room..

Marble Slab Creamery at Stonecrest delivered pre-packaged cups of ice cream (they brought Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry, Butter Pecan, Birthday cake)  and set up tables so that you could mix in your own goodies.  I opted not to take the hot fudge or carmel sauce and skipped the toppings (they brought an assortment of  nuts, fruit, sprinkles, cookies, candies, and whipped cream).  The ice cream was sweet - but not overly so - and it was very creamy. The only disappoinment for me was that I actually like pecans in my Butter Pecan ice cream, but this had none.

It was my first exploration into Salvadorian food so it was the best Salvadorian food I have ever had.\\n\\nWith that said, the location is a bit hard to find as the parking and entrance are in the rear. \\n\\nWe sat down and looked at the menus, which lacked some English descriptions for many items, I can speak enough Spanish to know foods but some important details were missing.\\n\\nI opted to try two things I have never had before. Yucca and pupusa with cheese and layote.   Yucca came with some pits of fried meat that I did not even want and my meat-eating friend did not like. The Yucca itself was good but not too diff rent than a potato wedge fry, I guess starch is starch. \\n\\nMy pupusa was a cheese filled flat pocket I did not even see or taste the other filling. It was a bit runny from the cheese and lacked a firmness I expected. I used the accompanying bottle of hot sauce to add some flavor however, the sauce lacked any real heat. The chips and salsa were decent but nothing special. \\n\\nThe prices for the pupusas seemed good at $1.75 but the yucca at $5 was a bit steep. \\n\\nI will give this place one my try and I will be going with my native Spanish speaking friend.\n\nStars:",

It was a tuesday and really slow. We sat outside. Our server took for ever to bring us our drinks and completely forgot my beer. I cancelled my beer and figured id just order it from the bartender. When I go to the bar, no one is bartending (hmmm wondrer if thats why drinks took forever). Find out my outside server is actually the bartender! Shes supposed to handle the drinks for the entire restaurant and take on outside tables? Just horrible, when we ordered our food, we waited 45 minutes before we decided to jist cancel the order. Management looked confused and did nothing to help besides offering to comp our food. I don't want free food, I just want food.

I had just gotten some on the internet for less than 50$, but still needed them cut and programmed.  The guy at the parts counter said they couldn't cut those keys.  They might be from china or something and break their laser.....I am almost positive the laser isn't doing the cutting.  After we called him out on that, he did backpedal and say it might break the machine and not the laser.  We asked how much to get keys done there if we ordered them from him.  It was over 500$.  So I took my keys to Anytime lock and safe and got them cut for under $100.00, and now I have two new keys and the old flip key and valet key all programmed for my car.....\\nWhy does the dealer think we have bags of money?

Which meant the entire restaurant was sitting outside so we opted to be 1 of 3 groups that sat inside and had the place to ourselves pretty much.\\n\\nThe waitress was pretty nice and pretty patient with us because we spent so much time chit chatting and catching up that she had to return at least 5 times before we were actually ready to order.  My friend picked the place and I decided to give it a try cause I figured a different location might be better but the food was still just okay and the apple martinis were still very very strong.  So strong that she and I had to do some more window shopping for another hour to make sure I was good enough to drive after just one drink which is insane.\\n\\nThe place was very clean, I give them credit for that, but I personally feel for how bland the food was it's too overpriced.

        "Stadium is in the heart of downtown, surrounded by hotels.  Parking is different because of space and location.  Parking lot fees vary from $10 to $50.  If you are lucky on game day to find a lot with vacancies, otherwise go online and reserve a spot for $15.00.  Some lots guarantee security and restrooms and an attendant all day.  Now the stadium adheres to all of the newest NFL guidelines pertaining to what you can bring into the stadium.  Ladies were turned away because they had larger than regulation purses.  Those of you with seat cushions read the guidelines.  Diaper bags, another no no.  Parents were instructed to return to their vehicle and only bring what was necessary.  Food concessions was a big disappointment.  Bogangles were all over the place.  Other sports complexes over a superior variety, and your choices were limited here.  Was disappointed, since the web site had limited ticket availability, and yet there were way to many empty seats.  Before and after the game the city police are controlling traffic.  Everything is orderly.  Did not see to many venders parading up and down the sections.  Apparently, the stadium wants you to leave your seat.  Which may explain the enormous amount of flat screen TV's broadcasting the game on the concourse.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I was pleasantly surprised . It appears that several parties may have left or went shopping.  The bread was good and  scarfed it down quickly.  The portions are huge , enough for two . Our server brought us plates for the bread that were dirty except for the top plate. We ordered the spicy cashew chicken,  this tasked like a cheap version of orange chicken . It was extremely salty and deep fried. . I don't recall getting any cashews. We also ordered Asian salad. It was drenched with salad dressing which was too salty we had the jambalaya chicken and shrimp which we liked but they must have forgotten the sauce.

        "Review: I would normally give OG a 3-4.  They are consistently decent, rarely outstanding.  If I want outstanding, there are non-chain restaurants that can fill that need.\\n\\nBut today was different.  We went there for Sunday lunch, party of six, and although it overall went well, it was one of the very rare occasions where my meal was screwed up.  I had a steak off the menu, and since their web site sucks and I can't pull down a menu and find the actual name, I can't name it.  But it had a parm sauce with bread crumbs, came with balsamic drizzled asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes.  The waitress asked if I wanted it medium or medium well, I ordered medium well.  A straight-forward order, nothing custom.\\n\\nEveryone's food came out, albeit slowly, and I started sawing through my meat.  And I mean saw.  It was tremendously over-done.  I sent it back.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Not only had everyone else finished their meals while I waited, but one couple had to leave.  My remake arrived, delivered by the manager, and I stuck my fork in to it and found it was not over-done.  First bite was great, then my wife commented that it was bleeding.  I know the juice is not blood, but it was very rare, well below medium-well.  I cut another piece and noticed something odd, so I scraped the toppings off and found that the cook (I will not use the term chef since they could not properly cook a small steak) had cut in to the meat to see how done it was, then covered it up with topping.  If they saw it was under-done, why didn't they just continue to cook it?\\n\\nSo I asked again for the manager and explained the situation.  She was very apologetic and It was taken off the bill, a substitution was offered but everyone else was done and I didn't want to detail the other three.  So aside from salad and two breadsticks, my lunch was balsamic-drizzled asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.\\n\\nMy wife theorized a possible explanation.  Since I did not actually send the original plate back, they couldn't see how over-done...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

If you park in the back and come in through the door that says customers entrance be prepaired to think you walked in through the kitchen becasue you kind of, did.  The host kind of pointed us to our table as others mentioned,,we walked past once and had to ask where he wanted us again,,not a great start,,,BUT,,and its a good but,,the food was amazing. The amount of tastes in this place was like a culinary Crayola box. We stumbled in on 1/2 price wine night which is Sunday-Monday-Tuesday,,,yeeehah!   Nice moderate list to begin with gets downright cheap at 1/2 price, Altos Malbec and Shegesio zin nice. Wait staff took a bit to get to us but was great throughout. Starters were asavado tacos, brie, turkey relleno,,all were very good. I had the blackened pork tenerloins with apple chile sauce,,amazing,,sweet with a hint of heat but overall amazing.  Others had cheese steak, mixed fish grill, Rokerij steak and enchiladas,,all very good. The inside really is a mostly bar with great food so be prepared for some rowdy locals but this place is killer on teh food side and you can go for a 4 star meal in jeans which is what I'm always looking for,,,just a great spot that I will return to in Phoenix any day!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I actually got the idea to come later (after the lunch rush) because of the Yelp reviews.  Good thing I did because the ladies who lunch had taken every table except for one!\\n\\nLooking at the menu, the first thing that struck me was that this wasn't a lunch place!  Most of the crepes are of the sweeter persuasion.  Which is usually a-okay with me, but I was starving for some sustenance, so I needed to go with the savory.  I choose the veggie crepe, with mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes.  The crepe itself was nice and fluffy, with a good amount of veggies in the middle.  I thought it was the perfect amount and even came with a nice side salad, which included mandarin oranges.  \\n\\nNow I know a lot of you will say, why not just go for the sweet then, but I've gotta have my savory before I have my sweet.  I know, I'm a weirdo!  But, I had a little bit of my friends dark chocolate and banana crepe and it was just a delicious teaser to what will most certainly be my future dessert here!  \\n\\nHot Tip:  Cash only!  Come on off peak times because it's tiny and you'll be hard pressed to find a seat during lunch hours or Saturday/Sunday brunch.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nHotel restaurant.... Overpriced for mediocre food and terrible service; right? WRONG!!\\n\\nWe had gotten out and about while in Phoenix but finally decided to stay local and went to the Pointe which is on the top of the hill from the resort we stayed at The Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort.\\n\\nWe walked from our room, not for the faint of heart, and the grounds, and the building are beautiful, rocks, fountains, landscaping and all.\\n\\nThe third floor is where the main dining room is and as we past the second floor leading up we past a Christmas party which looked sheik, and I thought wow, that's a good sign if locals go here. The view is breathtaking and my pictures don't do it justice but their web site does. We were seated by the window and Corey took care of us along with an unnamed busser who was equally skilled. \\n\\nWe started with Blood Orange And Rocket Arugula Salad, and Roasted Butternut Squash Ravioli. Both Outstanding in the WOW category. We followed that up with: \\nPan Seared Diver Scallops\\ncharred organic rainbow cauliflower, roasted sun chokes, black fermented garlic, apple basil evoo emulsion\\nAnd:\\nA filet Mignon that today I can't find on their site the way we had it. With mushrooms, and blue cheese.

        "Review: This vet is near the Roadrunner saloon off of the Black Canyon access Rd. (I-17) on the east side of the freeway. I was there once a few years ago when my son's dog got in a fight and they took excellant care of her. But this morning we got a last minute appointment (with only kindness and understanding expressed by the staff) as we needed our beloved dog to be put down a.s.a.p. He was gasping for air, in much distress, and we ran in, my husband carrying our dog Tinker, and within minutes he was released from his agony. The vet is like a giant teddy bear, he said \\\" This is quick, painless and now he's free from pain\\\". Both my husband & I were crying, he gave us our space after hugging me and saying how sorry he was. He could not have been kinder or more effecient. Likewise the rest of his staff. We brought Tinker home with us and now, many hours later he has been buried next to his mom (Pumpkin) and my son's dog Lord. The hard work of digging his grave in the hot sun, of gathering rocks and dead Ocotillo branches together so as to securely cover him and protect his remains from scavengers is difficult but also very satisfying. it is a funeral and really gives comforting closure.\\nI highly, highly recommend this vet as everyone there was extremely compassionate. The emergency visit cost us only $60.00 - which is very inexpensive compared to most other vets.Thank you Wiekhorst Wayne for helping us in our time of need and I am now and forever will be grateful to you and your staff.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nThe Concourse gets away with a lot because I think they know that they're the only game in town. There is the Edgewater with great views, but it's run down and the city won't let it be taken over by someone who may refurbish it. The Hilton Monona Terrace is beautiful, but more expensive. So, to their credit, the Concourse is cornering the market. However, because of this advantage, I feel that some things in the hotel are not looked after as they should be. \\nI was allowed to stay in an adjoining room with noise levels that interrupted my sleep for 5 days before being asked if I'd like to be moved. I was not offered one thing in recompense for my discomfort and lack of sleep. I was also never compensated for a poor meal service that I received via room service. The fish was hard and dry and I complained...never to hear from anyone again. My coffee makers didn't function FOUR CONSECUTIVE TIMES and they kept bringing up old coffee makers that had lime/rust stains in the water chamber. I felt like I may get Legionnaire's from drinking the coffee. I finally had to ask for a new machine fresh from the manufacturer's box and was sent one immediately. How was that not the FIRST choice in problem solving? \\nWhen asking about laundry, I was told that I must go outside the hotel and be taken by shuttle to a local laundromat. It was 9p.m. and I asked if the local laundromat was open late. The front desk staff sort of pretended to be looking up information on the internet and then he asked a supervisor if laundry was open late in the city. She had a phone against her ear talking to someone else and just nodded \\\"no.\\\" I found out later that the laundromat is open until midnight. I had precious little time in my visit to do laundry and could have gotten it done that evening, but was brushed off as a nuisance. \\nThe decor in each room is old and just plain standard...nothing special. The wall sconces are all cheap and don't sit on the walls properly...sort of leaning off the left or right like you would find in a Super 8....\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review: Fantastic view!  Unusual experience.  Try the slide on your way into the restaurant.  :)  Be careful of the big long horn outside!  (Be careful not to miss him, that is!)  As a pesco vegetarian, I had worries about this place.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a veggie burger on the menu.  It came with some great toppings on it, which proved to be too much for me to eat all at one sitting.  The nachos on the appetizer list are also amazing, but too huge to be shared with less than three other people.  If you've got out-of-town guests in tow, definitely bring them here for the view and the cheesy southwestern dining experience.  I hear great things about the rattlesnake...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Folks very friendly and one of their services includes signing out DVDs for the kids to see in the room at night. Special thanks to Jay and George at the resort activity center. Despite the heat and crowd they were always motivated,  positive,  helpful and extremely capable. They took care of activities for all kids regardless of age group and never neglected one overt the other. They were truly the heart of this resort. \\n\\nThe 2 room apartment was spacious and comfortable. The cleaning could use a bit more attention since we found nail clippings inside the pull out couch and hairs hanging from the bathroom fans. Other than that everything was clean and in order. I'd visit again for sure.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "After reading some positive reviews on Yelp, I thought I would try out Rocky's on my VW Golf.  It need some sprucing up, buffing out some scratches and polishing the headlights.  They did a really great job, paying a lot of attention to detail.  I dropped the car off the night before, and they called me in the early afternoon to tell me it was all set.  I had to get a ride back to the garage a bit later in the day, and the guy said he'd be around after closing for a little while in case I had any questions.  I was really pleased with the job they did.  Super clean, buffed out all the scratched bits I couldn't get out myself.  The headlights were too pitted to buff out with a standard polishing, but they looked better than before and they didn't charge me extra for the time they put in on it.  They also tried to keep my car inside most of the day while it rained so I could see it clean and sparkly when I arrived.  Stellar work, and I appreciated the great communication about time frame and expectations.  The total bill was also a lot less than I was expecting.  I will certainly be back!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "I'm so glad that there is at least one Asian grocery store in the valley. Unfortunately they seem to have a hard time keeping some of my favorite items in stock, I wonder if this is a result of some of the import restrictions/delays that have been a result of the recent quality issues with food and toys imported from China.\\n\\nI'm half Chinese and spent much of my youth being dragged around Chinatown near L.A. by my grandmother and 6 or 7 aunts. So the 99 Ranch Market brings back memories...some fond...some not quite so. But, at any rate, the prices are great and the selection is good and authentic (when it's in stock). The cashiers could use a little dosing from the friendly fairy, however. Then again, I don't remember many friendly cashiers or clerks at any of the stores I frequented as a kid...so I guess it just makes the experience all the more genuine for me.\\n\\nI would recommend going on a weekday, or, if you must go on the weekend, just avoid going around lunchtime. There's a dim sum restaurant in the same shopping center and the parking lot gets pretty jam packed with cars and pedestrians.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

It meant a lot to our family to have dinner together with 6 of us arriving from Madison, Baltimore, Chicago, and Colorado. We made a reservation for 4 three weeks ahead of time, but then we did apparently confuse the staff by adding two more people several days before the meal. That caused a hostile reception from the hostess, who seemed to feel we were somehow gaming her reservation system and we further aggravated her by arriving 17 minutes late (from 4 different cities), when she had warned us over the phone she would give away our table after 15 minutes. \\nHowever, the host more than made up for it and he was truly wonderful to us. Now about the food and drink: hummus was great and the crunchy pita crackers were fine when we could get more of them. Wine choices were limited, but we liked the Romanian cabernet, offered at a reasonable $22/bottle. We had the Shish Feast for 6. The lamb chops were way overdone. Rice was good. Overall a somewhat distressing experience for me (the dad) because of our reservation issues, but the food was decent and the host went way out of his way to make the evening special, thus the 3 star rating despite my concerns noted above. In fairness, it was a Saturday night on a very busy graduation weekend in the city. Prices were more than fair, service was just ok. Host was wonderful and charming.

We walked in and this guy said they're too busy to get us in. we argued and we got in. they told us the groupon will be in the system and we do not need to keep the printed groupon. The 2nd time we came back they asked for the groupon. We argued then the guy working the counter gives us a punch card and says, \\\"ok ill let it slide this time, but here is a punch card for the future.\\\" We've been here 3 hours and our car is still \\\"30 minutes away\\\" Judge Joe Brown is on the TV in the waiting room.

        "What the heck? Did I go to a fake Niro's Gyros? My experience was trash compared to the rest of the yelpers here.\\n\\nThey had 2 burgers and fries for $5.99 on special. I thought I ordered that and even tried to point at the marker board to the woman taking my order, who clearly looked as if English was not her primary language. I also ordered 1 single gyro. It came out to $15.\\n\\nWhat I actually got was 2 burgers, a single gyro but no fries. I would have went back but didn't realize it until I was already home. I could have sworn I said \\\"THE TWO BURGERS AND FRIES\\\". Even after my order was taken I thought I heard her shout my complete, correct order to the cook. No receipt was given so who knows if it was right at all?\\n\\nAnyway, the burgers were most certainly not worth $3 each, they were mostly bread and only come with 2 pickles, ketchup and mustard. Cheese is also $0.50 per burger, and honestly was comparable in taste to a McDonald's \\\"burger\\\", if you even want to call that garbage a burger at all.\\n\\nNext was the gyro which I was hoping was going to be at least a little better than the burgers; it wasn't. Yes, it was a large portion of gyro meat but quantity does not make up for quality, for me. At nearly $6, this monstrosity was way too greasy. I know gyros are a greasy food, but this was excessive. The paper it was wrapped in was soaked and I had to pick it off in pieces. The grease content was similar to a $4, 1lb burrito you get in the bad neighborhoods of Chicago. Regardless, the two slices of tomato were fairly large but there were hardly any onions on it at all, maybe 2 small O slices, but I'm doubtful either of them were fresh. The tzatziki sauce was hard to taste from being drowned out by all the grease, making it more of a watery, greasy mess. I didn't care for this gyro at all, the only thing going for it was the quantity of meat. However, my local beef stand back in the suburbs has a gyro that isn't half as greasy and in my opinion is much better. Oh, did I mention it costs $2 less?\\n\\nI had... My rating for this place is",

        "I have gone to Women's Specialty care under Dr. Kelly for two years. Overall the staff has always been very unfriendly, even cold at times. But just this year they pulled some major shinanaghins on me that have caused me to leave them for good. First off I recieved a bill for a Wet Prep (which basically is a Pap), when I didn't get one. I had a urine sample- which I never got billed for until I went back to them for a check up and was told that because of my 'outstanding' bill I couldn't be seen, unless I fixed it right then. \\nWhen the front desk lady told me this I was confused and informed her of the Wet Prep bill I was recieving- I told her that it must have been a mistake and that they possibly could have given me the wrong bill. She tapped on her computer and snapped- yes, SNAPPED that they had no such Wet Prep down for me.\\nNo, really? That's why I'm saying it must be a mistake. Well the Wet Prep bill was not resolved right then, because no one, NO ONE would listen to me for more than a second before asking \\\"Can you pay this urine smaple bill?\\\" and totally ignoring the reason why I hadn't paid it yet- BECAUSE I AM GETTING THE WRONG BILL!\\nFor two months I called, left messages and sent emails but no one ever called me back or even tried to help me. I had to call LabCorp (who was trying to bill me for the Wet prep) they told me they themselves could not help me, that the doctor who requested the test/sample had to stop the request and then called the manager- yes, the manager. Of course at that point I was contacted- daily, and told that they magically found some doctor notes that said I had a sample taken for testing.\\nI would remember her going up my U-ha and taking a sample. \\nThey were rude, they talked down to me like I was some child, they threatened- saying basically if I continued down the line to a lawyer that because the doctor had NOTES that anyone would side with them. \\nWorst place ever, save yourself a headache and don't ever come here.

Also, we had brought our own brand new soap and we figured we could leave it out because it was so different from the hotel soap...but it was gone after the housekeeping people had been through.\\n\\nWe would not stay at this Days Inn again, it was too much money for mediocre service.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "My friends and I had an hour to kill before the Elite Great Gatsby Yelp Event. So after a stop at the sex shop down the street, which is a whole other story, we stopped in here for a drink. Now I am not a coffee person at all. Not even close. The closest I will get to coffee is a frappuccino which is nowhere near coffee which is why I like it. I was looking over the menu looking for anything I might like and noticed they had Italian Soda. Hey that sounds good. The woman behind the counter, who was very nice, realized that we were newbies so she explained how things worked. Basically you can get any flavor you want in any drink you want. So I settled on a peppermint Italian Soda. The prices I noticed were very cheap for a coffee place. I was expecting smaller sizes for that price but no I ordered a medium and it was pretty big. Much bigger than I expected. Plus with 10% off for checking in it was great.\\nOnce I placed my order my drink was made very quickly and with a great attitude. It tasted great. Cool and refreshing and it hit the spot.\\nAfter looking over the other reviews I wonder if I went to the same place because I had a great experience and would go back again if I was ever in that neighborhood. Maybe I went on a good day or they have straighten things out or something. But for the price and the taste of my drink I would definitely recommend it. My rating for this place is",

The saving grace was Paradise Cafe.  It was the only high quality and decently priced place to get a meal that both my child and I would like.  If you're traveling alone I'm sure you can find other places but having a kid really limits the choices!  Also they have a complete lack of power outlets!  Most airports these days have a long row of nice leather chairs with outlets in the arm, but PHX is lacking this.

When I objected, he reworked the estimate four times and brought it down to just the essential items, which came to more than $500.

People in this part of Phoenix are punks and your bars are small and overcrowded. Also, it would be advisable not to give drunken or any customers control of the bar remote control. This could lead to alot more verbal spats.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nThe only reason anyone goes to this restaurant is to sit on the deck and drink.  I want to like this place so badly I keep coming back and hoping that it'll be awesome and it just never is.  Like dating someone who is very very hot but also very very stupid, it's amazing how much patience one can have if there's a really good atmosphere.\\n\\nOne year I took my father here for his birthday.  I don't usually call people names but our waitress was just a complete idiot to the point we felt bad for her and that was the ONLY reason we didn't freak out on her completely.  She forgot my dad's food order.  She brought out mine, but then neglected to notice that my dad was sitting there with nothing.  The manager came out and took our drinks off hte tab, btu that didn't help very much bc we'd only been able to order one round in an hour of waiting bc the waitress had only come to our table twice.  Then when they brought my dad's steak out, the waitress dropped it (I felt bad for her), and apparently that was their last steak.  I just paid the bill and we left and went to Eat n Park.\\n\\nThe second time I came back the service was equally as terrible, but also it was late summer and our table was literally attacked by wasps.  Seriously, attacked by wasps.  My friend got stung.\\n\\nAnother time I'd made a reservation for my friends 30th bday and they said htey didn't do reservations but could put tables together.  When we showed up, it was like I'd never called.\\n\\nThe last time I was there it was ok, but after being attacked by wasps my friend and I opted for the patio and only ordered burgers.\\n\\nThe service here SUCKS.  Getting attacked by bees and then having to wait for your server to bring you ice sucks (holding a cold beer bottle against the sting helps).  It just sucks here.\\n\\nBut the atmosphere is fantastic!  When your waitress comes ot hte table, just order a whole bunch of bottled beers nad you should be ok.\n\nStars:",

        "Review: I've seen commercials for this place before, and meant to come here sooner, but I finally decided to come in today.  I thought, ya know, its nice outside today, I think I'm going to go for a drive!\\n\\nThis place is way far out on the East side of town.  I don't mind the drive since it's kinda pretty, and it was right off the expressway too.  I wasn't shopping for anything in particular, and went in with an open mind.  \\n\\nThere's a lot of parking here, which is great, but its also easy to forget where you parked like I did.  It all kinda looks the same, and there aren't any markers to remember in the lot like at the mall.  I found my car eventually, but not without a lot of wandering around!  LOL\\n\\nAnyways, there's an enormous amount of stuff for sale here.  Clothing, kitchen stuff, knick knacks, wind chimes, and a whole bunch of other stuff. Some of it (okay, a lot of it) is cheesy items, but there are some good finds here. I scored some Avon stuff in a booth, and also saw a few cute things for my garden, but didn't purchase them since I wanted to get home.  There was also an enormous amount of old people here, I guess it's their thing to do on a Saturday afternoon, so be prepared!\\n\\nI had an okay time, and wouldn't mind coming back in the future.  The drive wasn't so bad, but its more the random selection of stuff that they have.\\n\\nO, and they have a food court here too, but I would rather eat at the resturants on the way in, that's just me.  They even had this old guy belting out some tunes in the food court area, which was pretty neat!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Our waitress was pretty clueless....she boxed up my leftovers, but threw away my ginger and wasabi...come on!  I had to request more and it kind of felt like I did something wrong.

Only one seafood entree (fish tacos) on the entire 4 pg card was less than $12, and that included soups. I didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos.  \\n\\nEntrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas, which was a nice surprise.  My son had the house specialty,  camerones culuchi, and I tried a flash-fried whitefish, served whole with sides, for 15 bucks.  We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly forgettable. My fish had about 150 pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an attempt at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.  \\n\\nIt's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful.  Service seemed friendly, if a bit confused, and having grown up in New England,  I'm aware seafood can be pricey.  That said, after tax and tip, we spent $40 for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch, in a hole in the wall just south of Roosevelt. \\n\\nJudging from the other reviews, it sounds like we just came at a bad time, but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back.

        "I have to say I was very disappointed with this place, considering the level of reviews it's received, the location nearby lots of other great spots, and just the look, feel and menu.\\n\\nThe first problem was before we even went.  I had tried to call and make a reservation, but I couldn't hear the person who answered the phone at all - it was super crackly and cutting out with only tiny bits and pieces coming through.  I tried calling a few times with the same result.  So I had to just give up and go when we were ready to eat and hope we could get a seat in a decent amount of time.  When we got there, though, they said they could seat us, but we'd have to leave in one hour for another reservation (wonder how they got theirs!).  We thought an hour should be plenty, so went ahead.  But then we proceeded to sit there for about 25 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us at all - so there went almost half our time, despite 4 servers just kind of slowly wandering around and standing around.  I tried hard to get their attention to no avail until I finally got up and asked.  Our server just made a lame excuse.\\n\\nThe problems just continued from there, taking forever to get our appetizer, a bad drink for my wife, more crappy, inattentive service, and finally to top it off - bad food too!!  I was pretty shocked actually.  But both of our dishes were bad.  My wife got a fish special that was super bland, and I got a steak that was sitting on top of a soggy piece of bread, swimming in a pool of watery sauce that was spilling off the plate as the server so carefully tried to set it down in front of me.\\n\\nIt kind of seemed to us that maybe this place used to be good, or is maybe good on other nights or something, but this was a Friday night and for everything to be bad, from start to finish like that just seems pretty suspect.  As if the whole regular staff, including the chefs were out on vacation or something.\\n\\nI am giving it the benefit of the doubt and not rating it more harshly because there was really good...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I ordered a yakitori skewer right at the end to try it, and then the famous honey toast.\\n\\nOf that, I would order the pork belly, tataki, goma ae, gingko nuts again. Gingko nuts were just kind of novel and fun. Pork belly was perfectly unctuous with the creamy egg on the side and almost-but-not-quite-too-salty broth. Tataki was buttery and rich, with a nice portion size. The spinach was a nice balance to all the meaty richness I didn't try all of the vegetarian things. the fried rice had a good flavor, from what I hear, \\n\\nthe server was really great about trying to keep the vegetarians from accidentally straying to the meat side. we were able to order the okonomiyaki meat-free, and she steered us away from things with hidden shrimp paste and such.\\n\\nall the food plus two alcoholic beverages came to 90 after tax and tip, and was totally worth it.\n\nReview rating:",

        "We went with family who go here on a regular basis and were underwhelmed. While I see the appeal of the all you can eat Happy Hour, the rest of the experience left a lot to be desired.  If all you want is a couple of drinks and a couple of small plates of free mediocre tacos - then by all means, knock yourself out.\\n\\nWe wanted an actual dinner so we went to the other side of the restaurant to get a real table away from the happy hour crowd. And there we sat, with nothing but chips and salsa, for at least 25 minutes. Two different servers took orders and attended to other tables within view and not one person even acknowledged our existence. When we attempted to get their attention, we were ignored. We finally got up and left and went elsewhere.  Based on the menu options and the quality of the food at Happy Hour, I'm willing to bet there are probably a dozen other Mexican restaurants in the area that offer better food and service.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

It being the oldest steakhouse in Vegas, I had to give it a try.  \\n\\nThe place is pretty swank if you like that old school feel, which I do.  The cozy booths and the piano player set the tone for what I expected to be an excellent evening.  \\n\\nI snagged some of the Caesar's Salad that was prepared table-side.  I think I would have preferred the dressing come out of a bottle since it was so bland, I couldn't tell it was Caesar.  For an appetizer I went with the escargot that was touted as a house specialty and got sick from it immediately.  No, this wasn't my first or even tenth time having escargot.  I don't give up though and out came my monster of a prime rib.  Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed.  The meat was full of tendons and gristle, out of the 24 ounces only about 10 was edible.  Sadly, the whipped potatoes were the highlight of the meal.\\n\\nWe did feel P.I.M.P. leaving the restaurant in their complimentary limo yet the free ride wasn't redeeming enough.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nThis is \\\"my place\\\"- if you come to town, we eat here. If you want to grab a drink, we'll go here! We even spent one horribly drunken New Year's Eve partying it up with the Rock Bottom crew. This would normally be a 5-star review but I feel like their service has gone downhill a bit in the last 6 months and this could stand to be addressed.\\n\\nFirst of all, you cannot beat Happy Hour! As a beer snob, I often feel left out when the Happy Hour specials only include America's favorite urine-colored watered down drinks. Occasionally I can get a Sam Adam's or Blue Moon, but it's nothing to match. The specials here vary by the day but you'll be able to get a pint of beer or a mixed drink for around $3- sign up for their free Mug Club and you'll get 20oz mugs every time too! There's a patio with smoking on one side only- it's great to sit out there most of the year but does get packed close to the weekends. \\n\\nThe food specials at Happy Hour beat the oh-so-cheap yet mediocre Applebee's standard. Most appetizers are $3- a few items, such as sliders, show up just for happy hour and aren't even on the regular menu. There is a burger they offer for $5, and you can get a bucket of fries or kettle chips for $1.50. The sliders are my favorite (both chicken and beef), and i'd also recommend kettle chips, the spinach artichoke dip, or the nachos. \\n\\nThe beers could almost use their own review- there are 6 or 7 to try and account for what people like to drink. There is usually a special seasonal beer along with a cask-conditioned option. As I mentioned before, the best way to drink beer is with a Mug Club card. You'll get a 20oz mug for the 16oz price and accumulate points towards things such as logo pint glasses. If you like the urine-variety of mass-produced beers, try a Dreamcatcher. If you enjoy good flavor, try the El Jefe Hefeweizen, Desert Trail Pale Ale, or Raptor Red. At this location in particular I think the El Jefe is the best. \\n\\nThe food is delicious- i'm getting to the point where i've tried almost...\n\nReview rating:",

The pizza was good, and the toppings were solid. It also included a half dozen wings, and I went with honey hot. The wings are pretty tasty as well, and just a little bit different from most places - maybe a little crispier. The breadsticks that came out early were also good.\\n\\nThis is definitely on my list for pizza, and with it being in delivery range, will be an option for days when I just don't feel like cooking or leaving the house.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Mind you, I was moving so I did not get a chance to check for the pick up email, but figured after a half day, the order for the television would be ready, but not so.  \\n\\n    I went to customer service and they stated the order was stuck in the dot.com fraud que.  I stated it was ridiculous as they had the money from the authorization and could see my id and the card I was using.  The customer service associate called the dot.com department was was told they didn't know how long it would be for the order to come through but it could be up to two days.  I asked if I would have done it in person at the store if I would have gone through the same thing and was told I probably would have walked out with the tv at the point of sale.  Question best buy what is the point of ordering through your website with the store pick up if I can get it faster just by going to the store?  So much for convenience.  \\n\\n   I told the sales representative to tell dot.com that that was bad service.  Apparently she did follow up and tell dot.com about my displeasure and they offered me $15 in reward zone certificates to placate me.  I would have given this two stars, but I gave it three as at least the in store associate tried to correct the issue.\\n\\nFor those of you that order through the website beware!  If you use your debit card you may not be passing go to get your item until 1-2 days later. My rating for this place is",

        "Review: I can count with one hand how many times I've been to a Walmart. This is not where I'd normally go to get groceries or anything during the day. It's one of those rare trips when somebody asks you a favor to pick something up late at night.\\n\\nThis isn't where I'd get fruits or meat from. I prefer not getting anything food-related from here. I've bought a stop-watch, pillows, light bulbs and laundry detergent from here. There's a reason why the prices are low here and attract a certain crowd. I'm not a fan of how they run their business so they can sell cheaper products but I also understand why people come here.\\n\\nThis place makes me depressed to know this is your American \\\"superstore\\\" where the average Joe spends his money and uses his coupons, etc. Everyone moves so slowly and there is no sense of urgency and order. It's like watching a herd of cows waiting to be slaughtered.\\n\\nLong lines and only a few check-out counters open. What I find puzzling is the even longer line for express check-out. A regular check-out counter with 5 people with carts of about 30 items vs express check-out lane with 10 people with 20 items or less. Hmmmm...\\n\\nThe layout doesn't make too much sense. People hog lanes and they will not move. It looks dirty and blah. I got plenty of reasons why I avoid Walmart. Sad place. I would normally linger in a store because I get mesmerized by colors but Walmart doesn't do it for me. \\\"I need to get out of here quick!!!\\\"\\n\\nI was telling our Social Worker in the office about my experience and she was like \\\"girl, what were you doing there on Welfare Check Day?\\\" - like I would know that information?\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Awesome.\\n\\nI'm just getting home from the worst experience I've ever had at this place, arguably the worst experience in my 27 years in Vegas ever.\\n\\nWe rolled in there with a group of 6, played some blackjack and all lost our asses (can't blame them for that, it's the luck of the draw),and then went to end our night at the restaurant.  I had to use the restroom so my friends went ahead and got a table...I walked in right as the waiter was finishing up taking everyone's food order.  \\nI asked him what the specials were, he told me, and I told him to give me a minute.  \\n\\nI proceeded to sit there for 30 MINUTES.  I asked the other server there (brunette wearing a red shirt) if I could order some food.  She told me very rudely that she wasn't my server but she would let our waiter know.  Once our server (black male with shaved head) delivered everyone else's food, AND STILL DIDN'T ASK ME WHAT I WANTED TO ORDER, I said screw it, I'm going back to play more blackjack.\\n\\nAfter I lost more money in a matter of a few minutes, I went back to join my friends at the restaurant, still hoping I could get some food.  I sat there for another 15-20 minutes, watching my friends eat, and making constant eye contact with every employee I saw while I watched them serve multiple tables.  FINALLY when our waiter brought the check, he asked me if I needed anything.  I responded with \\\"I don't want to order food now, all my friends are done eating and they want to leave\\\".  You would have thought I was that dude's worst enemy.  He gave me a dirty look and responded \\\"I asked you a long time ago\\\" (bullshit) , and ran away back to the kitchen.\\n\\nI told the casino manager on the way out about my experience, telling him that I'm not complaining, and we would probably be back, but I wanted to let him know about the sub-par staff he had at the restaurant.

        "Review text:\n4 stars for stock. Negative 2 stars for terrible customer service, and it should probably be more but I'm feeling generous.\\n\\nI walked in and there was only one other customer in the store. The worker, I'm presuming owner, was in the back playing on her computer. She never once greeted me, asked if I was looking for anything in particular, if I was ready to check out. Nothing. I was invisible, and I was there for about 45 minutes. What the hell. The other customer had to *track her down* to pay, and she didn't seem happy about it. \\n\\nTheir stock is the only redeeming quality - and I won't lie, compared to some other stores in Vegas, their selection is fantastic. They had not only older novels, but tons of newer novels in great condition. Looking for Game of Thrones? They have about fifteen copies in paperback. They also have an extensive childrens and YA section, which (although I'm twenty two) is a favorite of mine.\\n\\nI'm surprised this store has survived so long with such terrible customer service.\\n\\nTip to the owners: SMILE and say Hello to the people who are giving you money! I would have purchased today if I had been greeted even once, or engaged in conversation -- but instead, I left feeling sour. Buying books should not be a negative experience. The reason I don't buy solely online is because I like face to face interaction with other book lovers, but they certainly don't work at this store.\n\nReview rating:",

        "I went with the girlfriend to see Cats at Ovens & this place didn't impress me all that much. It was my first trip to the theater, so I decided to dress up with a tucked in button down. I was pretty surprised that a good number of people there weren't dressed up at all. I also wasn't impressed with the auditorium, it seemed very old & getting to the rundown stage. We sat far back for the show & the seats were almost too far back. My eyes have gotten pretty bad & I'm sure for some of the older folks in the crowd it can really be a hassle sitting too far back.\\n\\nWhen the lights were on, the place seemed just too shoddy for theater performances. I usually think of theaters & plays being in nicer venues, but Ovens just doesn't cut it. But when the lights went off, I realized none of that stuff really mattered. The performance was very good (even though I had no idea what was going on), the sound was fine, & I was pleased with the whole thing, other than being too far away.\\n\\nLike I've said before, I'm no rich man but the play would have been a much more enjoyable experience if we were sitting closer. I'd recommend closer balcony seats over farther away lower level seats. \\n\\nSo Ovens really didn't impress me in the looks department, but once the lights went off the performance on stage didn't disappoint. Not one of the best places in Charlotte to catch a play, but also not the worst either.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: We arrived on a Saturday morning at about 9:30. At the time it wasn't that busy, the restaurant was about half full and there was only one couple ahead of me at the counter when I ordered. I was there with my family of 4.\\n\\nThe Good\\n - The restaurant was immaculate. Very clean and modern looking. Its a cool place.\\n - The staff is very friendly. \\n\\nThe Bad\\n - So... very.... slow....\\nI'm not sure if she was new but the lady taking orders at the front counter was PAINFULLY slow. Watching her take the order of the couple of ahead of me was a lesson in patience. When it was my turn to place an order the experience was only slightly better.\\n\\nOnce my order was taken it took more than 10 minutes just to get our Cinnamon Roll.. and it was cold! They didnt even take a moment to throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds.\\n\\nIt took another 15 plus minutes beyond that for us to get our breakfast. By that time it had been more than 25 minutes since I ordered and my kids were bouncing out of their chairs with boredom. Considering how slow it was when we placed our order that is just WAY TOO LONG to wait for food.\\n\\nThe Eh..\\nThe food was alright. If I take into consideration it cost $30 dollars it was a pretty poor experience. But on its own merit, the food was no better than OK. My biscuits and gravy were cold, the pancakes might have been OK but the syrup was terrible. \\n\\nFrankly, given the standards for great food set by Joe's across the street I expected way better and next time I'll just wait in line for the Farmhouse next door.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nLet me first start by stating that I'm an ovo-lacto vegetarian (meaning I eat eggs and milk products) but no meat or meat products (such as chicken broth, lard etc...) so my two-star rating is informed by that. I usually am successful at finding great food at mexican restaurants since many have transitioned away from using lard in much of there food and provide some fresh, vegetable based options. Not so much at Nando's. After informing our waiter of our vegetarian status, he wasn't sure what was vegetarian or not. After asking the cook staff, we found out that there is lard in the enchilada sauce (UGH!) and beans. We ended up ordering some cheese enchiladas with salsa instead of the regular sauce. \\n\\nIn terms of what we ate, it was okay. If you like lots of cheese and eat meat, you may love this place! It's your basic mexican restaurant fare (lots of meat, beans and rice) :) Also, the atmosphere was nice (adorable patio) and would consider going back for margaritas. But in terms of food, I'll keep looking for a mexican restaurant with some healthier, vegetarian friendly options and a staff who is confident in what they are offering.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Wow!!! This past Saturday, on a whim, my family and some friends decided to go \\\"venture\\\" out to go on the Dolly Steamboat Dinner Cruise. Now at first I didn't want to go, thinking that it would be boring or an old-person kinda thing (sorry older folks), but I must say I was extremely pleasantly surprised.  \\n\\nThe drive into Canyon Lake is and was breath-taking, surrounded by mountains on all sides, greenery, flowers, and then as you come over the last turn, you see the lake surrounded by the mountains -- it's so surreal, it's one of those \\\"pinch me, I must be dreaming\\\" kind of moments. \\n\\nWe arrived and parked, and since we got there a bit early, we were able to enjoy the scenery from on the dock, which is gorgeous! When we were finally able to check in, we were a bit skeptical about sitting outside since it was still quite warm out, but we were assured we would love it -- and we did!!! I'm pretty sure we had the BEST seats in the house (aside from the captain, of course)! It was so peaceful and serene, and the temperature was perfect (actually even got a bit chilly as we were coming back). \\n\\nI have to say, the crew on the Dolly Steamboat -- Jeff (our Captain), Heather, and John -- definitely made our experience unforgettable! They were lively, bubbly, personable, friendly, and cracked jokes which made the cruise that much more fun. Our Captain, Jeff, made sure to point out the Bighorn Sheep (which was really a neat sight to see!), the vultures, shared interesting facts about the cruise itself, explained the caves, and told us other interesting facts as we cruised along. Heather and John were other crew members on the cruise that made it amazing! Our group pretty much made them our personal photographers since we took as many photos as we could before our cameras died, but they didn't seem to mind. \\n\\nThen came dinner... and OMGoodness was it amazing!!! I didn't think the food would be all that good but wow! The chefs cooked up some chicken (the most juicy piece of chicken I've EVER had in my life),... My rating for this place is",

Humidity and temperature within the walls are sweaty hog blistering in the month of January. Food takes a little too long for it to be called \\\"Express\\\" and takes even longer to eat it. Why? Because the cuts of meat are akin to those of urban legends more along the lines of Snopes. The only flavorings are eclectically listed on my palate as soy sauce and sugar. When asked for some Sriracha sauce the owner gives thee a look as if asked for pickled human placenta.

I ignored my intuition that this place is probably only suited for breakfasts.  \\n\\nThere were limited items on the menu that were healthy.  I ordered the soup and sandwich combo.  I had black bean soup, which was pretty tasteless, and the chicken salad sandwich, which was unremarkable and doused in too much mayo.\\n\\nThe worst part is my dining companion got the special, a chicken fajita bowl.  Now, let's grant that you probably shouldn't expect excellent Tex Mex in a joint with antiques and an Americana vibe.  But, he took the plunge.  He sincerely regrets this, as he was rendered useless after eating the bland \\\"fajita bowl\\\", which was more like chicken salad with jarred salsa in a taco bowl.  By useless, I mean he must have gotten an extreme case of food poisoning because he spent the entire remainder of the day making multiple trips to the men's room.\\n\\nAfter an experience with the food here that left us sick, I wouldn't come back.

I told them delivery and they just made excuses. Never again.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: Sweet Cakes, or \\\"that Mormon place,\\\" as many of my fellow workers in downtown Mesa call it, is a good value, and has excellent baked goods.\\nWhy \\\"that Mormon place\\\"? Well, sometimes they have a basket with a sign that says, \\\"Free gifts,\\\" and you get all excited, thinking maybe it is full of cookies or pens or something -- but then you realize it's full of free Books of Mormon. \\nOn the upside? Excellent cookies and brownies. It's only a lunchtime place, and the best value is a soup/salad/half sandwich combo, which comes with a pickle spear and a cookie. It costs about $6.50.\\nThe soups are really heavy - I haven't even finished my cups of them when I've eaten there.\\nAnd, while you won't find any of your trendy pesto-fresh basil - buffalo mozzarella-gruyere-proscuitto kind of stuff here, you will find nice, home-baked breads and simple veggie, turkey and french dip sandwiches. Get the honey wheat bread, it's the best.\\nIt's often pretty crowded with the Mesa/Gilbert Stay-at-home-mom crowd, so it can be hard to grab a seat, but the tables clear out pretty quickly.\\nMake sure you grab a big cookie to take with you.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nYesterday about 3 in the afternoon the wife and I went in for a late lunch since I had to go to work in a hour or so. I open the door and it's heavy like it's spring loaded, we step in and sure enough the door slams behind us with a loud bang! Ooops I thought and I see the waitress cleaning the booths on the far wall, even with that loud booming door slam she didn't even acknowledge us, back turned to us and not even any eye contact or \\\"hello, I'll be with you in a moment\\\"  We take a table and still no welcome what so ever. We are both looking at her and she goes on wiping tables and not a glance our way. She is actually cleaning the rest of the booths and continues to ignore us. My wife says, \\\"lets get out of here\\\" and I thought so too, but I needed to eat before I went to work and so we stayed. I had to yell out, \\\"could we get a couple menus?\\\" and the waitress was really unwelcoming and cold. I am like, what in the world is she doing serving tables? Maybe she is working two jobs and is really burned out or someone pissed her off recently? but we are the only ones in the place.  As we looked over the menu some other people came in and she again acted like she didn't want to serve anybody. I've had better service at Carls Jr. and if they weren't a few miles away we would have went there instead.\\nThe burgers were good and a 1/2 pound double was too much for our appetites. Fries were excellent and the cook with the black cap back there is doing a great job on the food. The waitress circled our table a few times, but never spoke to us to ask how everything was luckily my wife somehow got a refill on her drink. When she circled around us, I asked for our check and she was grovelling to herself and replied back like, \\\"I\\\"LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU AS SOON AS I COME BACK\\\"  We left a few dollars tip and with that cold treatment from the waitress we over tipped in our opinion. People like that should not be serving food, we liked the food, but will never be back considering the unfriendly waitress.\n\nReview rating:",

The trick spying the fabulous examples of period lighting in the jumble.  \\n\\nThe styles range from Art Deco to Mid-century Modern.  This is the kind of place I have to avoid because I have a real soft spot for fantastic period lighting and it's an expensive habit, honey.

The lighting examples here are the real deal and the prices are fair.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the shopkeeper can be a bit brusque.

They spent so much time trying to up-sale the people in front of me that it took over 40 minutes to get a person through the process. Even when people kept saying they were not interested they kept pressuring them. It got to be a sarcastic joke among the people in line. What made the wait longer? People went on lunch during this time. I am pretty sure one person left to check her text messages (she pulled out her phone after finishing a customer...50 minutes after I got there, looked at it then left ....only to return in 10 minutes). When I got to the counter and complained about the wait the person told me (seriously) 'If time is important to you I would chose another company'. \\n\\nAs I finally left I looked at the other company counters...Avis had one customer and two people. That was the busiest competitor they had. \\n\\nAvoid at all costs!!! \\n\\nIf you made the mistake of reserving a car with them and can't change the key is be terse with them. If they try to pressure you to take something you have already refused don't even speak. Just look at them like their idiots until they get the point and give you what you reserved at the price your reserved it at. \\n\\nIt is possible to get through the process in less than 10 minutes if you do this.\n\nReview rating:",

On my most recent visit the guy in the Acoustic guitar section didn't even acknowledge my presence. The acoustics are in a big room that's closed off from the rest of the store. When someone walks in you know it. I asked to see a mandolin that was in the case. He walked over and said \\\"It's open\\\" with an annoyed tone and handed it to me. Excuse me for assuming that I should ask before just reaching in a closed case with expensive instruments. I figured they're in a case for a reason.\\n\\nI also had a situation where one guy told me he would restring my guitar for free if I bought the strings. I bought strings and he restrung and tuned my guitar. Nice! I came back and the other guy said they don't do that and NEVER have. I was so confused! I don't mind paying but he made me feel like I was a liar and trying to get over on him. I took it to Guitar Center on the other side of town.\\n\\nI recently went on vacation in Nashville and went to the Sam Ash there. Night and day difference! Everyone was so friendly, informed and helpful. You can tell they actually love music and are passionate about their jobs. I like this store but wish the employees would act like they give a damn. Even if you don't like your job - be happy you're working period!

Perfect for grabbing a drink or light meal before or after a show.\\n\\nBoy and I popped into Bossa Nova before the ballet. We saw suits de-stressing from the week, some 30-something females looking to get tanked, and some were just like us, waiting to go to a show. \\n\\nI had an (uncharacteristically) girly cocktail. I was dressed to the nines for the ballet. I figured... why not? It was sugary sweet and through no fault of the very lovely bartender, I will stick to wine and beer from now on.  Boy chose one of their many scotch selections. \\n\\nFor tapas, I had the fig and goat cheese toastas. Boy chose the stuffed peppers. Strangely, my food arrived about fifteen minutes before the peppers. The restaurant was not crowded in the slghtest, so I found this puzzling. Having tried both, I thought the tapas were bland and overpriced for things I could have easily made at home. Boy disagreed. He really liked his peppered. \\n\\nThe quality of the food and drinks (and their corresponding high prices) probably merit a two-star review. But we were greated by a very pleasant hostess and served well by the nice bartender. Their service alone probably earns Bossa Nova the three stars I am giving. My rating for this place is",

        "I have been here multiple times and have usually had great experiences, but last night was awful.  We made reservations as they had a promotion for National Cheeseburger Day and there were six of us.  When my friend and I got there, we told the hostess that we were meeting friends and had a reservation under another friend's name, and she shrugged at us three times before asking us how many were in our party and never bothered to find our reservation.  We told her we had an infant with us, and she looked annoyed to have to accommodate a baby.  She eventually asked us if we wanted to wait for the others in our party or sit down, and then walked us to our table and told us nothing about who our server was or ever cracked a smile.  \\n\\nWe sat for at least 10 minutes with no service and eventually flagged down a waiter, who found our server, who arrived about 5 minutes later.  The drink service was incredibly slow, and the food service was okay.  Our burgers were average, which was disappointing since we've come there often and enjoyed the burgers.

I was still responsible for the beers because she had poured them. She conferred w mgmt, same response. I explained I don't live anywhere near there and would never use them again.

If the \\\"mgmt\\\" of a local place doesn't have the  sense to make it a worthwhile experience for their paying customer, then what is there to do? Very disappointed in their service. Ps I've bartended before and never seen someone grab the ticket and then dunk it on top of the drink they have going out.  I witnessed this time and time again.

The front desk personnel were helpful in pointing us in the right direction to get started seeing what the city has to offer, and our room was clean and comfortable. The free breakfast buffet is standard Hampton fare: waffle maker, omelet or scrambled eggs, sausage or bacon, bread, muffins, bagels, a selection of cereals and yogurts, juices, coffee, etc. Wi-Fi is free throughout the visit, you just need to log in again once every 24 hours for each device.\\n\\nThe location is good, just a few blocks from Tyron Street and very close to a train station that can take you around downtown. It's also very close to the NASCAR museum and the convention center.\\n\\nParking is I think $10 a day for self-parking, which is a lot for a Hampton. It's in a garage, which is nice, but the speed bumps (four per level) are really obnoxiously big, requiring that you basically come to a complete stop before going over them unless you're interested in risking suspension damage and incurring the cost of reseating your kidneys.\\n\\nPark on levels 4 or 5 for direct access to the hotel via a small corridor connecting the buildings. It's much easier than the other levels, where you have to take an elevator down to ground level, walk through the entrance, then to the elevator up to your room.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

This review is strictly for the restaurant and casino.\\n_____________________\\nFood Quality: 0\\nThis casino is so small it's best to think of it as a restaurant with a casino area. We eat here regularly, and the quality has been declining for over a year now. There is a $6 steak deal. My favorite is a huge platter of BBQ for $10 (this is seasonal). They have $9 prime rib. The portions are so large you will be full. The past three times we've eaten here the food has been cold and it took a very long time to get to our table. Last year it would be hit or miss (some days the brisket would be great, others the chicken would be totally cold like they did not bother to microwave it). Their definition of doneness varies. One time I had raw prime rib that I took home to recook. One time I asked for medium well, and they nuked it into rubberyness. Their eggs are sometimes dry (do they nuke these too?). \\n+1 cheap. -1 wildcard doneness for steaks. -1 bad items. -2 (update) somehow slow and cold.\\nWhat I'd Get Here: The chicken fried steak. Any steak if you like it Pittsburgh.\\n_____________________\\nService Quality: 3\\nTheir was friendly, but lately it is just OK. For the restaurant, they take your name and call you when your table is ready, and it can be heard throughout the casino. However, the speed depends on how full the restaurant is. Lately the service is slow. When we confronted the waiter that our food was cold, he insisted that it had 'just come up', but it was room temperature. On the casino floor, the drink waitress will come around more often than in other casinos.\\n-1 hit or miss service time. +1 frequent drink waitress.\\n_____________________\\nAmbiance and Location: 1\\nThis is a dive. It doesn't loose points for being a dive, because it's pretty clear that this is no ritz from the outside. It's off of Boulder and Flamingo, near Cannery and Sam's Town, so it's in a better location compared to other dive...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Quite the opposite, the YMCA values plenty of equipment, cleanliness, and supporting people's health and education!\\n\\nI visited the Harris branch earlier because I'm thinking about a membership. The thing that I really liked was that the membership allows you to go to any branch...talk about mobile convenience! They have indoor and outdoor pools, multiple rooms and space for cardio equipment, lots of weight machines, indoor track, and basketball courts. Now if the workout side of healthy doesn't win you over, maybe an onsite coffee and smoothie cafe will speak your language. Seriously, that is dangerous. \\n\\nAnother huge perk is that they have lots of aerobic classes and they have special classes (which you pay more for) such as ballroom dancing. How fun! In general, the main classes (e.g., yoga, spin, etc.) are included in your membership. Your kids can even sign up for various camps too. No application fee or contracts...bonus.\\n\\nI may run into you here...or another branch...I'll keep you guessing because I can!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

THERE IS ALSO OFF TRACK BETTING FOR HORSES!  in the main room is a bar surrounded by tables. i think it looks pretty cool. all the tables have black table cloths and candles. there are multiple tvs for betting or sports.  the food is advertised as ecclectic. the menu is large with a great variety of food. this is not just plain bar food. they have ribs, steaks, calamari, sandwiches, burgers, chicken, pasta, etc....  i think the food is really good. the steaks are great and they give you plenty of quality vegetables for sides. the salads are large and they have a variety of specialty salads. appetizers are priced better then other places. they have a cheap appetizer menu 7 days a week for happy hour. appetizers during happy hour are ONLY $3.00. they have simple appetizers like wings up to really good like calamari. 3.00! they are known for their deep fried pickles which i find good. if you are looking for a more quiet place to sit other then the bar area and tv area, there is a separate dining room. i've never been let down by their tasty food and quality service. you can go here for a good party time, a romantic dinner, or a family dinner. good all around place. they have a smokers patio with misters.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

We seem to always choose a bunch of appetizers instead of entrees and just make a meal out of them. This go around saw us trying their staple, the lettuce wraps, along with the lemongrass chicken pan fried wan tons and the Dynamite Shrimp plus a couple others. The lemongrass chicken wan tons were bursting with flavor. The dynamite shrimp were top notch! Very similar to Bang Bang Shrimp at Bonefish but these shrimp are bigger! Plus they got served in a martini glass (nice touch). A big shout out to our waitress, Ramona, and the rest of the team! Super friendly and very attentive! If there was any complaints it would be the overall set up. The tables are pretty close together so there isn't much in the way of privacy. The food & service makes up for that.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I asked for the sugar scrub and calluse remover. After she busted out this weeks newspaper to put under my feet...??? She went and got this cucumber lotion and was making a big deal about how good it smelled. Anyways she gave my my pedicure when I went to pay they said they only accepted cash tips. I ran to walgreens next door to get some cash. When I returned to give the nail tech my tip the man at the front desk told me he needed to charge me $10 on my card. When I asked why my nail tech came over and said it was because I got the calluse remover and the cucumber lotion...I agreed that I got the calluse remover and agreed to pay the as advertised price of $5 more however i explained I asked for the sugar scrub and did not receive that. All she kept talking about was the cucumber lotion. I told\\nher I didn't ask for the cucumber lotion she went and got that and I would have been fine with the lotion that was included. Again she never said the cucumber lotion was extra and I didn't receive the sugar scrub like I asked. I felt like she was just trying to get more money out of me and was not being honest. The massage was short and not relaxing. I will never return to Wendy's nails again. Next time I will wait until I can get into Biagio!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

There is even a small Greek section of the menu which offers low end Greek dishes (Gyros Sandwich, Gyros Plate, Greek salad, Feta Cheese plate, and something called Shrimp a-la Mike!)\\n\\nThe menu has print so small, only a search light and magnifying glass can decipher it. \\n\\nThey do have some authentic dishes, like menudo, carnitas, lengua con chile verde; and the basics like enchiladas, tacos, tamales, tostadas, chimichangas, carne asada, chalupas, fajitas and flautas. \\n\\nThey bring you chips and two types of salsa. We ordered (extra) guacamole, and it didn't taste or look very fresh, like they mixed a jar of paste with a couple of avacadoes. The Margaritas were uninspired and weak. \\n\\nI tried the Machacas (sauteed shredded beef) which was moist but lacked flavor, and was supposed to be with green chilis, tomatos, and onions with rice and beans for $10.95). 3 others in my group were unimpressed with the food, and they were French Canadien (So what do they know about Mexican food, except when it isn't good!).\\n\\nThey also have steaks and chicken dishes, but why bother? \\n\\nThe food was passable but would not entice you to come again, unless you got drunk at a ball game at the local Chase Field stadium and were starving.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "My Grandma has lost some weight and needed some new clothes. She had a special coupon for Kohl's and she had some kind of credit to use here so here is where I took her. \\n\\nI find Kohl's to be the kind of store I have to be in the mood to deal with. A lot of times one has to sort through the crap to find the good stuff and since Grandma likes to hit the sales rack first, I had to dig deep to find the patience to deal with everything. Luckily, we were able to find a few things that worked for her and I was glad. I was also happy that she listened to me when it came to sizing and was very grateful that the dressing rooms were large enough for both of us to be in. My Grandma is now 88 and I look like her. I have a feeling I know what my body will look like when I am 88 as well and once I managed to swallow that reality, we both had a little bit of a laugh. \\n\\nCustomer service isn't the best at this location and I guess they get quite a few shoplifters as there was a police takedown going on in the housewares section as we walked by. I just chalked that up to entertainment and steered Grandma the other way.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Me and my husband got take out from here and we're not impressed, to say the least...  We got fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and it was horribly bland. It tasted like nothing. The mozerella garlic bread just tasted like fried bread- there was no flavor or seasoning and you couldn't even taste the mozzarella.  \\n\\nThe food was supposed to be ready at a certain time but it took them 20 minutes to get us the food (and we even arrived 5 minutes behind schedule). It was our first time here and the signs for take out said 'curb side service' but no one ever came out so we had to go in and the hostesses weren't exactly helpful or welcoming- indifferent is a good word.  Perhaps online it should state you need to go in to pick up the food (as some resteraunts actually take it out to you when you order to go and paid online already) or change the signs that say 'curb side service' because this is misleading.\\n\\nAfter waiting 20 minutes to get our food that we had ordered an hour earlier- you would think it would be piping hot but it was more like lukewarm- and that's being generous.\\n\\nThe portion size was pretty big, we got the smaller size and I think it could feed at least three people or more...\\n\\nUnfortunatley the food here is just blah and we will not be returning, first impressions and all...\\n\\nIf you are looking for good Italian food- keep looking!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "I'll be short, and just get to the point on this one:\\n\\nThe only reason I managed to give this place 2 stars was because they definitely gave you good sized portions for the price.  However, a large portion of nasty, is still just nasty, regardless of how much they give you.  The Chicken Fried Steak (their pride and joy) was bland and the only flavor was grease.  I don't mean the typical \\\"its a fried dish\\\" grease flavor, no i mean it tasted like after they pulled it out of the fryer they dipped it in the oil vat.  The gravy was nondescript and flavorless.    Side options were nothing special, they seem to rave about the cole slaw, but it is not my cup of tea, so I passed.  This place seems like the type of establishment that if you are a regular then you get stellar service, if you are not, then oh well to you.  Funny, because how do people get to be a new regular if you aren't giving decent service to the new guest.\\n\\nTo sum it up, people swear by this place. I however, have sworn off this place.  I don't get it, I left feeling ripped off and revolted that I even ate that junk (now don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good chicken fried steak, this just was not it for sure!)\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Than, finally walks up to the person( in our group) that just came in, after us 3. He sais\\\" what do you want?\\\" No smile not the least bit friendly. A friend of mine paid for our round of drinks and gave him a dollar, when I wouldn't have given him nothing. Thankfully we had a nice server at the table.

We got a killer deal on Expedia and it was a nice stay.\\n\\nWe were greeted by a friendly lady named Amber who checked us in and told us about all the amenities that comes with our stay.  Free dinner and cocktails between 5-7 M-F.  We didn't partake unfortunately but that sure is a nice thing to offer.  They also offer free breakfast which we did use every single day if not just for coffee and juice.  The food wasn't the best nor did they have the widest selection, but it was free so you cant complain.\\n\\nThe rooms were nice and spacious.  They had a fridge, dishes etc.  This would be an awesome place for an extended stay.  They had a separate bedroom with a large bath.  The shower was kind of narrow and sloped weird but the rest of the bathroom was nice.  The bed was comfy and they provide you with a shitload of pillows which I love.  The only bad part about the room was the furniture.  The couch wasn't comfy at all, and they had this little old school recliner which wasn't too comfy either.  Dont know what kind of cable they have but it only had about 15-20 channels which was weak.\\n\\nThe pool area was nice and we swam pretty much every single night.  Only once was someone else out there.  The pool is small, but its perfect because nobody was in it and they always had a stash of clean towels.\\n\\nThis hotel is located about 5 miles up Scottsdale Blvd from all the hipster hangouts/bars in downtown Scottsdale.  Free parking too.  And free internet.  Overall it was an awesome stay and I would definitely come back again next time we venture over to AZ.\n\nReview rating:",

        "For under $8 (in South Park, that's nothing), I was served two eggs, two potato pancakes, three pancakes and three turkey sausage links.  I went for lunch on election day 2010 and though the place was packed, our party of two was seated immediately.\\n\\nThe eggs were decent; nothing special.  The potato pancakes were pretty good, but not the best I've had.  The turkey sausage and pancakes, on the other hand, were the best I've had in Charlotte.  In my experience, turkey sausage is just something that restaurants keep on hand to please their selective customers (again, this is South Park we're talking about), but I actually feel like the Original Pancake House cared about the quality of even their more obscure ingredients.  As for the pancakes, they were simply the best I've had, which says a lot considering I'm not a huge fan of pancakes in general.\\n\\nThis filling lunch was well worth my $8.

        "Went in yesterday around 2:30pm. Only one stylist, who was working on another guy. Waited approximately 15 minutes for her to finish with him. A couple of minutes before he left, a woman came in. Even though I'd been waiting - and the stylist had acknowledged me when I'd arrived - she called the woman by name and off they went.\\n\\nWhen I asked if there was a second stylist, the sytlist said no, that she'd called in sick. Then, the stylist said the woman customer had called in an appointment an hour before, obviously intending this comment to answer my implied question about being overlooked.\\n\\nI didn't realize that Supercuts took call-aheads, but that's not my gripe. What was annoying, rude, and unprofessional was that the stylist didn't tell me when I arrived, or even when the woman arrived, that I wouldn't be next up. So I wasted about 20-25 minutes unnecessarily.\\n\\nWhen I started walking out the door, the stylist intoned an insincere, \\\"Sorry.\\\" I used to live nearby but never was terribly impressed with the place, and now I have one more reason to switch to Great Clips 30 seconds down the road... which I did yesterday. The difference in professionalism - nothing more than simple courtesy, really - between the two shops is significant.\\n\\nI noted that Supercuts has a training center here in Charlotte. I'm thinking that my inconsiderate stylist might need a refresher course, if she's hoping not to permanently lose other customers for herself and her employer.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Growing up in Arizona, and the west side-I only find El Bravo okay.  I had never been there before, even though I love Los Reyes de la Torta which is down the street.  I had heard a lot about the place and I finally had the chance to check it out.  I ordered a beef picadillo burro and a chicken green corn with sauce tamale.  \\n\\nThe burro was extremely disappointing.  It really didn't have any interesting flavor, spice or ingredients.  It was filled with beef and raw shredded cabbage, which I didn't enjoy. The tamale on the other hand was definitely the right choice--if it weren't for the tamale, El Bravo would have been a two star place for me.  The tamale was the best restaurant tamale I've had- the masa was soft, moist and perfectly seasoned.  However, for over $5 a tamale, I thought it was a bit expensive since it doesn't come with anything.\\n\\nA nice surprise are the cinnamon sugar crisps that come with your bill.\\nHowever, for a disappointing burro, great-but expensive tamale and a soda, I got out of there just under $17.  So is El Bravo good?  I think they have some good things on the menu.  Would I spend $17 for okay Mexican food on a regular basis?  No thanks.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Ugh!  I'm a huge Thai fan and this place was completely icky.  What I love about Thai food is that it is flavorful.  \\n\\nI ordered my usual that I get from every Thai restaurant I go to...just see my Yelp profile.  Their pad won sen was flavorless and had some of the weirdest ingredients.  I didn't want to finish it or take it home because it was so lackluster.  My friend ordered their garlic chicken which was just okay.  The amount of garlic they put in it should have been shared with my dish.  Yikes!\\n\\nIt was merely a place we chose randomly and I don't ever want to eat there again.  There are too many tasty Thai places in the valley to waste my time here again.

        "Review text:\nHORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!! I booked a king strip view room and although the view of the MGM and Tropicana was nice, the room wasn't. Carpets stains, toilet ghost flushing and running constantly all night and A/C kept waking me up when it shut off. This property blows! The analog TV was fuzzy and the bed was too firm for my liking.  The Hooters girls look bored when dealing and don't even smile. The Hooters restaurant also has a poor staff and manager. I wait to be seated and nobody tells me anything, so I seated myself. I order boneless and I get traditional. To top it all off....I booked my room through a popular third party website and at checkout I ask for the total and I am billed a higher price. I tell the employee at the front desk that INCLUDING A RESORT FEE it should be lower (RESORT FEE???? This is no resort) and she just smirks. I ask her to please find out why I'm being billed a higher price and after she kept me waiting forever and she finally comes back and says there was an \\\"error.\\\" No apology. Again this is the Las Vegas of today. Poor customer service. I will never in my life go back to that horrible Hooters hotel in Vegas. It needs to be imploded like many others have been before it. I don't care how cheap it is or close to the strip it is. Stay away!!!!\n\nStars:",

Unfortunately, I've been pretty let down each time I've tried to grab some good food from Scott's.\\n\\nThe service is terrible, at least for take-out.  They take their time and acknowledge you if they feel like it.  I don't know about dine-in service, but you can tell having a smile would get a waitress fired.\\n\\nAs for the food... potato knishs looked outstanding, tasted like something you could buy frozen.  Bagels were okay but I had the bar raised.  Scallion cream cheese left a lot to be desired, which is sad because I consider a good everything bagel with scallion cream cheese to be the ultimate new york breakfast treat (after a good egg sandwich, of course).  Damn, the egg sandwich was awful that one time... did they get their bacon from Wendy's?\\n\\nStill looking for a good NY deli, so feel free to pass one on!

        "Review text:\nI think this might be a new Chinese place I need to go back and try some more. First of all, AUTHENTIC Sichuan dishes! Not just in name only! Holy cow! I picked up my parents from the airport and we decided to give this place a try since they were always disappointed at Golden Buddha. What is this? Water boiled XXXX? Last time I had that was visiting family in China! Ordered Water boiled fish and twice cooked pork. I really like the flavoring of the twice cooked pork. I wanted to order the Yu-shan pork but was overruled by parents. Oh well. They didn't want spicy, so the water boiled fish wasn't after the told the waiter not to make it spicy. Guess I'll have to try again. So, definitely more dishes I need to try. For now, I am happy that there's an authentic sichuan food place in Phoenix and not just the lame old American Chinese that are so totally boring. I am so very disappointed that the Shanghai place next to Golden Buddha has changed owner and they no longer have the special Shanghai menu and the quality of the food has gone down the drain.\\n\\nUpdate:\\nTried the water boiled pork. That I thought was pretty good. The meat was nice and tender. The sichuan peppercorn made everything taste lemony to me later on, including the water. I guess that must be the numbing effect people talk about. I also liked the beef with jalapeno pepper. Nice flavor. And I still really like the twice cooked pork.\\n\\nI think the restaurant would be better served if they got some more comfortable chairs instead of the unpadded straight back wooden wobbly chairs they have now.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Yummy! Food is great, venue ... not so much. It definitely looks like a hole in the wall in the middle of a strip mall. Food is delicious and the place doesn't look super nice. But again, when you go to get food, you mostly only care about the food.\\n\\nI love love love their tortillas here. It's warm and doesn't taste like it's out of a plastic bag that you'd get from costco. The carne asada is also very good here, great quality. I ordered the Carne Asada California which is simply a carne asada burrito with fries in there. I also had some of my friend's carne asada fries. Both were really delicious, but I'm a fan of thicker fries when it comes to carne asada fries (in the burrito, I like it thinner). So really no complaints on the food. It's cheap. And if you are REALLY hungry, they have a Jumbo Burrito which is half carnitas and half carne asada for 8 dollars. Such a steal because it actually is.... really huge. Salsa was also very good, flavorful and had a nice kick to it. Staff is friendly, no complaints there. \\n\\nI wasn't a big fan of the venue at all. It's beat up, the dining room and furnishing are all really dull and the bathroom has graffiti all over the walls and is dimly lit. They have a couple of old video games and some old pool table there, too. Seriously needs a make over.\\n\\nSo come here and take it to go. Eat it at home or somewhere else where you can actually enjoy the surroundings. My rating for this place is",

I told her that was great and I would call her back to confirm. I was excited that I found a salon open on a holiday. When I called back, they were closed, which was okay because I left a message expecting a phone call first thing in the morning.

I had an important event last night and I was left scrambling for another salon, which was a complete disaster.\\n\\nWhen I called this morning to see if they could do anything for me, the 2nd receptionist I encountered was RUDE AND HORRIBLE as well.

The squeak was loud enough to awaken people and it did; several times throughout the night. The kids came back from the water park early because it was so crowded, they had to fight for tubes to go on the lazy river. We have been here before and it was a rather pleasant experience, I am sorry to say it was not this last time. I have written to the GM of the place and expressed much of what I reiterated here.

        "I've been selling at Buffalo for several years now, and while sometimes I walk away with a pocket of cash and others not so much, I've learned how to judge pretty well what they're looking for (seasonal items, condition, etc). \\n\\nAfter a good closet cleaning, I decided to bring a couple of bags of what I thought worthy down to BE. Let's see, after scrutinizing most pieces for a good 2 minutes, asking other sales associates to look things over, etc, I was able to sell five items - three with tags still attached. Guess how much \\\"cash\\\" they offered me? TEN DOLLARS. Ten dollars for FIVE items. Ten dollars for 2 dresses, 2 new tops, and 1 new belt. Are you freaking kidding me? What a rip! That means, if ten dollars is 35% of the trade, all five items will retail for a total combined cost of what, less than $35? What a total scam. Silly me was so shocked I just took my joke of a trade and left, but now I'm kicking myself for not demanding an itemized receipt to see what my items will \\\"really\\\" retail (cause they sure as hell won't only cost a combined $35).\\n\\nAlso, I brought in this gorgeous yellow 100% silk dress purchased at Anthro for over $100, and they said that if I dry cleaned it and brought it back (to remove 2 TINY spots on the bottom hem of the dress) they would purchase it from me - for SEVEN DOLLARS. So I'll spend $8 to dry clean it and then sell it for $7? Silly me but that just doesn't seem to add up. \\n\\nSeriously, Buffalo, stop ripping people off. You just look like a jerk. \\n\\nPeople, if you're not worried so much about the money aspect and are just looking for a change in wardrobe, organize a Frock Swap with a huge group of friends. You're bound to find way cooler items for no cost at all, and it's super fun to boot.

They have high quality salon products at affordable prices; this store makes my life a lot more affordable and I'm thankful that there are so many in Vegas.\\n\\nHOWEVER, this one isn't that great. The stock is the same, but the employees aren't as helpful or concerned with your shopping experience. Nobody ever asks to help you find anything in particular, they don't always have available stock out on the shelves, they don't recommend other products you need to use whatever you bought..\\n\\nI came in this day looking for a waxing kit. I've used the microwavable kits, but my sweetie finally agreed to let me wax his chest and so I wanted the good stuff. They had an awesome sale on what I was looking for ($30 for a warmer, all purpose honey wax, and muslin strips!- all Gigi brand), and I also renewed my Sally's card. I had to come in the next day to pick up waxing sticks. I went to pay, gave the cashier my phone number to look up my Sally's card but it didn't take the first time so she just charged my full price. I was a little turned off, but it was only $0.15 so it wasn't anything to get angry about. \\n\\nPROS:\\nGood selection\\nQuality Products\\n\\nCONS:\\nStaff with no customer service skills\n\nReview rating:",

        "I'll be the first to admit that I'm a little weary of shopping at thrift stores. The clothes always smell like they have been in the attic or someone's basement. The store washes the clothing but you can sometimes smell the faint scent of cigarettes. Not all the clothes are bad though.\\n\\nI like to shop for the high end shirts and pants. They tend to have a lot of items and the prices are out of this world. They have a lot of clothes are are still new with the tags on them and every thing. I recently purchased 6 shirts, 3 pairs of pants, a winter jacket and a Paula Dean sauce pan and 2 purses for only $55. These are nice clothes too, not cheap t-shirts with holes or stains on them.  I always take the clothes home and wash/sanitize them first before I wear them. \\n\\nThey have more than just clothes too. There are silverware, pots and pans, dishes, halloween costumes, shoes, baby items and even furniture and electronics. The only down side to this store is that there is no dressing room. So the only real thing you can try on are coats and shoes. I see people trying shirts and pants on over there clothes sometimes but it proves rather difficult unless they are men. My sisters tho did wear leggings to the store so they could try on the dress pants. They bought designer brands like BCBG, Black house|White market, Arden B, claibourne, Van Hausen, and lots more!!!\\n\\nThis stores prices are beyond great, almost everyday they have a special. On saturday it was half off all color tags except red. I found so many items $4 pairs of pants, $3 shirts, $7 jackets. The Paula Dean pot was only $4 as well and that was great coming from a thrift shop. \\n\\nIf your ever interested in shopping here it's best to go on a Wednesday or Saturday early!! Wednesday you get half off your bill if you bring a senior with you. I like to use grandma sometimes to get some cheaper clothes. She enjoys it as well so that she can buy all the little nick nacks and holiday items. Happy shopping!!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Really Great Place!  I discovered this place one day after walking out of AJ's across the where I bought a sandwich moments prior, when I saw this place with a big banner that read \\\"delicatessen\\\" I was immediately pissed that I didn't know it was there and bought a sandwich at AJ's, not that AJ's sandwiches are bad, but I crave a more authentic deli style sandwich.  Well they are very good, would give four stars but in Oakland at Genova delicatessen you get sandwiches so good that you are spoiled for life.  These, however, may be best in phoenix.  Owners are great, family run, very very kind people, authentic deli environment, awesome quality, good bread, who can ask for more? My rating for this place is",

        "The first thing you see when you walk into Landmark is a giant pastry case stuffed with delicious looking desserts.  This is pleasant to look at for a while, but this is where my pleasant dining experience ended.  \\n\\nOur service was lackluster, at best, borderline surly at worst.  Drinks were not refilled except upon request and despite our friendliness, it seemed almost impossible to get our waitress to crack a smile.  The restaurant wasn't busy at all so I'm not sure what her problem was, but it was definitely off-putting.\\n\\nI ordered 2 eggs over easy with toast, bacon, and fries. I'm allergic to onions, and home fries sometimes have onions, and I wanted potatoes, so I decided to play it safe.  After all, how bad can a plate of fries be?  As it turns out, pretty bad.  Like our service, they seemed lackluster, bored.  Maybe I shouldn't expect a diner to have amazing fries, but I've had amazing fries at diners before, and with such an extensive menu and supposed high status among Charlotte local restaurants, it wouldn't kill them to make a batch of crispy fries that didn't just lay insipidly and moody on the plate, refusing to be brightened with a generous ketchup bath.  The bacon was fried up too crispy for my liking, but that's a matter of personal taste.  Everyone agreed that the fries were...not great.  The eggs were fine the toast was actually really good (especially dipped in egg yolk...mmmmmm) \\n\\nThe rest of my party were also less than satisfied with their food.  They also nickel-and-dime you really hard for substitutions like a bagel and cream cheese, which is a huge pet peeve of mine.  Is toasting up a bagel and bringing out a packet of cream cheese really so cost-prohibitive that you've gotta soak me for 12 bits?  \\n\\nAll in all it was a LACKLUSTER diner AND dining experience.  You want normal diner food, go to the neighboring San Remo or Liberty East.  If you want EXCEPTIONAL diner food, go to Mattie's Diner.  If you want a step up from Waffle House, by all means check out Landmark.  \\n\\nJust... My rating for this place is",

        "Always see this restaurant when I'm grocery shopping at smiths. Curiosity kicked in and wanted to try. Outside appearance was not appealing. I almost didn't go in. But before I was gona leave I decided to depend on my yelp friends. It seemed to have some good reviews. \\n\\nFirst impression was divey. Really needs some help. Decor is old and the place is small. However the lady was very nice. I ordered chicken pad Thai from lunch special. The menu says you get soup. Then she nicely tells me you only get soup if you done in. She was nice and offered me done while I wait for my food. Maybe she heard my stomach growl. Lol .. My friend ordered orange chicken. Also from lunch special. Was happy when I got the bill. It was $12 for both meals. Now that's what I call a lunch special \\n\\nWhen I got home. I noticed they gave decent proportion sizes. My chicken pad Thai was delicious. My friends orange chicken was good but the sauce was more runny than what I'm use to seeing. Didn't care for the fried rice. It taste like corn bread to me. Next time I'm going with white rice. It also came with salad. Which is nothing fancy. Lil lettuce with ranch and crunchy won ton. They didn't have any other dressing choices. I will come back and try more things.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I'm sorry, but no, I will not pay ANYTHING for a gluten free meal.  If your steak is $20, then yes, I'm likely to get a salad or chicken. \\n\\nSorry.

        "Review: Went here on Friday the 28 for business lunch, the greeter didn't greet us , maybe because we were dressed casually , but our offices won't be hosting meetings or events here. They weren't busy but obviously under staff, took 15 minutes just to order anything . I ordered an Asian salad originally but it was the worse salad I've tasted it had no flavor, and loads of raw cabbage with chicken that was supposed to be marinated in sake? Tasted like processed deli lunch meat. Reordered the teriyaki chicken and it was dry and flavorless as well. Coworker ordered chicken curry katsu, salt overload. And another ordered Korean style ribs . That was good we all shared it being that own meals were unsatisfying. Too many other good sushi spots to pay the outrageous prices here. Go elsewhere. Poor service and poor food. Maybe their sushi is better. I didn't want to wait another 40minutes to get a roll.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Merry-Ann's Diner is a truck stop style 24 hour breakfast diner. Unfortunately, Merry-Ann's is not very good. I can't recommend it.\\n\\nMerry-Ann's menu, decor and layout, and overall look and feel, are identical to that of a Waffle House franchise. I suspect that this diner was designed to duplicate the successful Waffle House model. \\n\\nAll of the menu items, from the coffee, eggs, and omelets down to toast and sweet rolls, are poor, although some items are a notch better, namely mediocre. \\n\\nService is roughly comparable to that of other Waffle House stores. Ditto for the decor, and, in fact, the actual floor layout.\\n\\nPrices are low in absolute terms but they are somewhat high for the types of menu selections offered, quality aside. (And the quality delivered is mostly poor.)\\n\\nBefore the Hilton-Garden Inn took over the property across the street, there was a well-regarded breakfast restaurant, almost a Champaign institution, attached to the property. The Hilton razed the restaurant as part of its renovation. Too bad. The Merry-Ann Diner is not suitable for breakfast at any time of day. My rating for this place is",

        "Loaded with son, daughter-in-law, wife and two grandchildren we are frequent diners at Firebirds.  Given the children we come early, prior to 6pm and have no problem getting seated immediately.  We leave after dinner moving through the crowd in front waiting for a table.\\n\\nService is great.  Kid menu is better than average and they will get the children's meals ready quickly.  Helps keep them quiet and happy.\\n\\nPortions are wonderful.  Food is well prepared and excellent.\\n\\nOn one occasion I ordered the prime rib which came over cooked.  I can handle medium rare to medium, but not more or less.  This truly beautiful piece of meat came in rare enough to quiver. I hated to ask them to cook it more, as I knew that it would come back too done.  So it was, but I ate it and appreciated that they did re-cook it.  When the bill came, they comp-ted my meal.  I talked to the manager telling him that I wanted to pay for it as it was excellent and that I did not want to see a good piece of meat thrown out.  He insisted that the meal was on the house.  Unnecessary as far as I am concerned, but  that is the culture and policy of Firebird.\\n\\nTheir BLT salad is worth being a meal, and sometimes my son and I do just that.  The portion is generous and if you order it with your main course you will not finish your main.  Suggest you split the BLT salad with someone.  But baby, it is really a yumilicious treat.\\n\\nBaked potatoes come with lots of toppings. But be aware that the spuds are rolled in heavy salt while baking and though I love the skins I just can't take the salt, even if I wipe it off.  But the potatoes are great.\\n\\nWe have not had a bad meal and have really worked through the menu so can confidently tell you to order what you want as you will not be disappointed.\nSo I would like to give it",

It is  typically bands just starting out, not established valley bands.  This downgrade came with a cover charge. So, most of the locals and regulars no longer go here for their music  fix.

Although, the walls are kind of thin, we woke up to some girl yelling at her bf the next room over. Kind of amusing but not at 3 in the morning. \\n-Small hotel which means less walking to and from the garage and our room, woohoo!\\n-Not smoky! I hate walking through the big casinos and having my eyes sting afterwards because of all the smoke. This can possibly mean no one likes to gamble at Hooters but hey it worked out for me!\\n-Close to airport and freeway (we had a car). Probably not the most convenient place to stay if you don't have a car since it's at the end of the strip unless you love to walk.\\n\\nBad:\\n-Elevators to garage are old and in desperate need of repair, be sure to hold on\\n-Late check in. We came around 11AM and they told us we could check in at 4PM. Luckily we called back and they were able to get us a room earlier.\\n\\nThat's about all the bad stuff i could think of.

        "Still waiting for the day that I only give some Ritz-Carlton location a 4 Star review.  After this visit to the Phoenix version, I continue to wait.  Check in was smooth, the room was immaculate, drinks before dinner at the bar were served by a friendly bartender who was clearly proud of the bar menu and quick with recommendations even though I wound up not eating there.  \\n\\nAbout the room...  I love walking in an R-C room and just soaking up the little things.  The towels hung perfectly even in the bathroom, the water bottles lined up so nicely, no art on the wall with the slightest tilt.  It's moments like these where I admit to the small inner perfectionist that lives within me even though it's normally overshadowed by the stronger, ok with chaos side.  The Phoenix room was perfect in all regards.\\n\\nIt's a nice location too with plenty of good dining options within walking distance.  Should I have a trip to Phoenix in my future this Ritz will be high on the list for a place to stay. My rating for this place is",

        "Review text:\nI like this place.  It's tucked in a Bashas strip mall, NOT facing the road.  I found this place when I was running some errands, and thought I would give it a shot.\\n\\nOk, so I like it here.  Free wifi, cute layout, indoor and outdoor seating.  Seating is limited, in the sense that its a lot of two tops or a few 4 tops, but nothing for a larger group, like lets say a random study group or whatnot.\\n\\nThey serve pastries, and I purchased one.  The girl at the counter said that the WIFI was free, but they wanted you to make a purchase, which is a reasonable request.  The drinks, in comparison, are priced more at a starbucks level, from staring at the menu.  prepare to spend $4 on a mocha, and $2.50-$4 on a pastry.  \\n\\nIt is quiet in here, no music. But, some people need that, and if I was studying, I would want it quiet in here as well.  \\n\\nThis seems like a great little spot.  I have not tried the coffee, yet, but its SO much better then getting starbucks!  The girl who helped me behind the counter seemed to know her stuff.   I like that in a good coffee shop-staff who know thier stuff!\\n\\nWhat I do NOT like about this place is the lack of bathrooms.  There is one bathroom, but you have to physically cut through the \\\"backroom area\\\" which is ugly and unkept looking.  Its kind of like back in the old days when you were a kid and had to cut through the stock room at the grocery store to get to the bathrooms. I was not impressed with the bathroom situation, and even though the bathroom was clean, I didn't like the fact that I felt like I was using a staff bathroom.  Not cool.\\n\\nSo, support your local shops and come here and enjoy.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Stayed two nights for football game. Good stay.  I would give this hotel 3.5.  Close to so many great things: Peoria Sports Complex (spring training for Seattle and San Diego), at least a dozen restaurants, Harley Davidson, Target and lots of other places within walking distance.  It's kind of hidden behind another hotel but great location.  And about a mile from the Arrowhead Mall.\\nGreat room, nice shower, comfy bed, microwave.  Fridge made too much noise at night so I shut it off before bed (turned back on upon waking).  I do have to say that the breakfast was nothing to write home about. Eggs looked like mini flying saucers that came off an assembly line. I tasted one and it wasn't cooked thoroughly. Tasted bland. Cereal and a few other items. But service was great and friendly.\\nGreat location, just off (101).\nSo I would like to give it",

        "We went here for lunch the other day.  It was busy, and seemed like a lot of business people came here for lunch. I took that as a good sign, since they chose to come to Portofino's over several good options pretty close by.  Unfortunately, I don't agree with their choice.  Our waiter was friendly enough, kind of a low talker, but otherwise the service was fine. We had the buffalo mozzarella and tomatoes for an appetizer.  It was good, though I would have real issues with a restaurant that could mess THAT up.  For lunch, I ordered the Ravioli special, my husband had a chicken parmesan sub and my mom-in-law had a salad with salmon and their house dressing.  \\n\\nMy meal bordered on gross.  It looked like they had taken all of the different ravioli left over from dinner the night before, put them on a plate, then smothered them in a creamy basil sauce with way too many olives and roasted red peppers, so that they were unrecognizable.  There was way too much going on on that plate.  I like all of the things separately, but together, none of the flavors were distinguishable when it was all together.  There were heart-shaped mushroom ravioli, huge round meat-pie ravioli, smaller round cheese ravioli, and square sausage ravioli.  Doesn't that sound like whatever they had left over was what went on the plate?  The sauce was really gross looking: vomit-like in color and texture.  \\n\\nThe salad looked fresh, and got reviews of \\\"good.\\\"  Jim's sandwich was good as well, though he said he would get something else next time.  The table next to us ordered pizza, which looked good.  I'll probably try that if we go back.\\n\\nThe other thing about Portofino's that I didn't like, was the noise level.  Normally in a restaurant, even a busy one, I can concentrate on our conversation and not hear others (unless I was trying :) ).  But this was a very loud lunchtime service, so I wouldn't recommend going there for a business meeting that you would like to pay attention to, or an intimate lunchtime date.

        "I was very impressed with the tacos. The best I have had in Las Vegas. However VERY Pricey. The first time I tried this place I went to the drive through. Prices showed on the banner for a taco was $2.50 so I thought ok not bad I have heard good things about the food here, so I ordered 2 Carne Asada tacos . The cashier asks, \\\"would you like everything on it\\\" I reply \\\"Yes\\\". So she tells me \\\"that will be $9.90\\\" I think to myself there has to be a mistake, maybe she heard me wrong, $10 bucks for 2 tacos that's crazy!. So I pull up, I pay, she gives me my receipt. I was charged an extra $1.50 per taco for the everything on each one, the sour cream, salsa, and guacamole. I paid it, but I totally think that is a total rip off. Especially since they do not post that extra charge on their drive thru banner. Not being very honest if you ask me. 4 stars for the food, but 2 stars for the prices and bad advertising.

This place doesn't seem to have any rule for waiting list. I am not talking about special, excellent customer care for us  from them, considering their location. Instead of kind apologizing,realizing her mistake or trying to make experience better, the dumb manager was extremely rude about this situation, and called security guard  to kick us out. I have never experienced this kind of shit in my life ever!!\\n     \\n   Especially  unprofessional manager doesn't seem to know what he's doing for customer care.\\n  \\n  Ha Ha!!!  How stupid they are and  treated customer as just trouble makers!!!.  Also, I have never seen any security guard  in this kind of  local  restaurant. I figured out  easily why they hired a big guy like a night club and how many times they kicked even their customers easily.  \\n  \\n  Their rules seemed  that Don't ask and don't  argue just follow whatever they do.   If not,  they (security guard) kick out like drunken man at club or casino. \\n   \\nYOU GET OUT !!! WHAT AN  ATTITUDE to customers. Don't ruin your day due to  this silly restaurant. There are so many better Pho restaurant  than this  in Vegas. \\nSuck!! seriously.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

First off, the seating is plentiful, and when you add a cool outside space during the warmer months, there's no shortage of real estate if your going at it solo or in a huge group. There's even a back room that looks like it can be closed off with a set of doors. Coffee and tea are what you'd expect, not the best brew I've had in town, but certainly not the worst. But it's their food options that blew me away originally. They really take the whole \\\"cafe\\\" thing to a new level with a plentiful amount of soup, salad and sandwich options to satisfy anyone. Think Panera, but much better. Much much better. The particular day I was there I dug into some minestrone and a half of a jerk sandwich served up on a toasted pita. Both were quite tasty. \\n\\nAdd some free WIFI and decadent looking pastries and you have the makings for a pretty nifty spot for chit-chat, laptop'n or busting out the bridge set.

They do really value their customers!\\n\\nAs for food:\\n- I got the Scallops - OH MY GOODNNEESS. So good, these are perfection, and in their EnLIGHTened menu. So one of the healthier choices and very filling.\\n- Like always my eyes are too big for my stomach so I also got the chili.

So good! And fancy.. so great!\\n-My bf got the Hamburger - Now... this is where it all went south. The hamburger was underwhelming, not juicy, not spiced, not anything. It just was a hamburger.

        "Review: Our second time here.  Be warned that Saturday afternoons are busy, they offer an all you can eat sushi deal.  We were not impressed by the sushi last time we were here, so that wasn't an objective.  Instead, we had crispy fried gyozo and tacos, both shrimp and BBQ pork.  The fried dumplings were excellent, I think they were deep-fried as they were crispy all around, I'm not sure you can do that with a skillet, and I have no problem with that.  The dipping sauce was decent but not exceptional.  The tacos were great, I loved my BBQ beef and my wife liked the shrimp.  Two tacos per plate made an excellent late lunch, very good portion size to be full but not stuffed.\\n\\nI do have to take exception to their guacamole.  I fully understand that they're going for an Asian, not Mexican, vibe for their guac, but it needed seasoning.  I'm not sure what, but I found the flavor kind of flat.  My wife thought it had enough salt, it just needed something to kick up the flavor a little.  Also, the wonton chips for scooping it?  Their strength is not up to the weight of the guac.\\n\\nWe had the Mojo's for dessert, basically it's an ice cream sushi roll.  The ice cream flavor can vary day-to-day, today it was strawberry.  The two pieces that we got were an excellent cap to good food.\\n\\nService was not good.  We had to flag down our server for refills for our tea, for a box for the fries to take home for our poodle, for the check.  They were kinda busy, still, it's what they're paid and tipped for.\\n\\nAnd finally, and sadly, whatever it was that I was smelling six months ago was still there.  I'm still not sure whether it's cleaning products or sushi, but it was something that really didn't sit well with my nose.\\n\\nStill, we liked the food and will definitely consider them for future eats.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "We ended up here because my friend wanted to eat something less greasy and fried so I said sure why not? Nothing wrong with a little veggie feast every now and again. If you are a veggie lover or a senior looking for a place to eat where it is not crowed then this may be the spot for you. It is true that this and the location in Phoenix I went to suffer from lack of choice issues. It is also one of the main problems I have with this place.\\n\\nOnce we walked in I took a look around and noticed very few people  were actually eating here, in fact the place seemed like it was ready to close down. The price for the lunch buffet is high given the lack of options they offered (four kinds of soup, salad bar, cheese pizza, a few desserts and a rather small bread selection). The bread was not hard but was not fresh either and they even went so far as to cut the bread sticks in half LOL who does that? Can I not have a whole bread stick?\\n\\nI am sure there are those out there who love this place but I am not one of them. Limited selection along with low quality of food does not make me a happy person or a satisfied customer. I was tempted to ask for my money back but just took it as a lesson learned. Never again!\\n\\n\\nIf you want a good deal I recommend hitting up one of the many other all you can eat places as you get more options for about the same price.\nSo I would like to give it",

These were pretty good, however I prefer them steamed to fried.

        "Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.\\n\\n\\nIt's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.\\n\\nWhen they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.\\n\\nFar from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something. My rating for this place is",

        "Their red bean and rice are fabulous and the portion is super generous!  I also had the Kentucky Thoroughbred cocktail and it was amazing.  There's something about sitting knee to knee with strangers at a nine-person diner counter talking about food and life and watching the chef's work in the teensy-tiny kitchen.  But don't worry - if you need some space and want to enjoy the amazing AZ weather there's a HUGE patio and fun little order window... something for everyone!  For dessert I got the homemade biscuit with goat cheese and apple butter.  The biscuit was warm but the cheese was cold and that was a weird combination.  But overall everything was delicious and I will totally be back!!! My rating for this place is",

They definitely get more into the pan-spiritual than other places, with a book to cover pretty much any shtick. \\n\\nIt is a bit too generic, though. I like places where I really get a solid sense that they're coming from a particular viewpoint, but Shakti was really a buffet of hippie-dom with no real connection. I didn't end up buying anything just because of this, even though there were a couple cool things to be found.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review: Having grown up in LA, I'm used to seeking out local Vietnamese places for a pho fix. My bf and I found this place on Yelp and tried it out for the first time a few weeks ago. We both ordered the Tea Lite Special which included one pho entree, a spring roll, and two egg rolls. The beef was good and the broth itself really made the pho delicious. I also enjoyed the egg rolls, but I will probably skip the spring roll next time.\\n\\nThe place was busy, but we had no problem ordering and our food arrived in 15 minutes. The egg rolls and spring roll came out even sooner. Plenty of seating with indoor and outdoor tables.\\n\\nGood customer service, fair prices, and delicious iced tea! What more can you ask for in a quick and easy lunch spot.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Not bad, but not memorable, either.\\n\\nFrom what I understand, Hillstone is an amped-up Houston's, like a luxury badge on a Marriot hotel. Yawn. \\n\\nI tell you all this because heading into my first visit to Hillstone tonight I had zero expectations. None. Well, other than expecting to be underwhelmed.\\n\\nShame on me, because Hillstone hit a home run.\\n\\nA beautifully appointed, thoughtfully designed, approachably classy  indoor/outdoor dining venue, Hillstone offers the same dressed-down menu of a Houston's, but in a nicer setting with truly elite service.\\n\\nKaitlyn, our server, was attentive and exactly the right level of chipper. She was pleasing to both my 7-year-old niece as well as my 65-year-old mother. That's no easy feat. The burger was perfect, the beverages were never empty, the table was cleared on time, the check was dropped off and picked up seamlessly and the staff was always around but never a nuisance. \\n\\nAnd I love the setting. From the bar to the bathrooms everything just works. There are romantic corner booths and more lively center room talbes and the patio is gorgeous, with a perfect view of bustling Camelback Road. \\n\\nWhether it's a business meeting or a first date, Hillstone will definitely get my repeat business.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nMy wife and I decided to stay at the Westin Kierland to celebrate our wedding anniversary this last weekend (4/19/2014).  \\n\\nYou know how sometimes before a weekend you are looking forward to you envision how you think it will be?  I envisioned getting a nice room when we checked in and then going down to the pool where we would have a couple of lounge chairs by the pool and frosty drinks brought to us by an attentive wait staff.  Maybe a few trips around the lazy river and a nice lunch by the pool.  After a few hours head back in to the room to get changed and go down for a nice glass of wine in the courtyard and then have a great dinner.  Maybe the next morning after breakfast go back to enjoy a few hours by the pool again and then head home totally re-charged from a nice relaxing weekend.  That's what I had envisioned for my stay at this property.  \\n\\nHere is how the reality turned out:\\n\\nWe arrived at 1:00 and were able to get checked in, the front desk person was very helpful.  Our room was nice, located on the first floor.  So far so good.  I was a bit concerned when I noticed there seemed to be a lot of kids running around the facility though.  \\n\\nWe went to the pool and it was a zoo.  Kids running around all over the place, screaming, and no seating whatsoever to be had.  Eventually we locate a table by the bar that is baking under the sun.  We take it and wait for the waiter to come by.  After 20 minutes of sitting there it is very apparent we need to go to the bar to order.  I go to the bar and after waiting in line for 15 minutes get an order in of a bucket of beer and a quesadilla.  The bucket comes with 4 beers, but they are larger than the standard 12 ounce bottles.  I think they were about $6 each or so, not that bad for pool pricing.  The bar guy tells me since I ordered from the bar I have to come back to the bar to get my food, even though I am sitting 10 feet away at a table.  Finally after a few trips to the bar to see if my food arrived, 20 minutes later I suspect it does.  I see it...\n\nReview rating:",

        "This is one of the spots I feel lucky we have in the Burgh! I mean, really lucky considering it shuttered its doors for a number of years and reopened semi-recently. \\n\\nYou can't beat this fun of an environment. Toss away the generic Hofbrauhaus get to a Pittsburgh legacy! I love the fun German beer hall feel with the large picnic size tables that just beckon you to sit down with an even larger brew!\\n\\nI love German food, but there's a really good opportunity to screw it up. Have you ever noticed a lot of the colors of German food blend together? Sauerkraut, perogies, mashed taters (is that German? Whatever!), they all look the same! So making them taste good is a must! I'm a big fan of the perogies - a buttery delicious mixture in a lovely little dumpling. While I'm not really a fan of their sauerkraut, it's too sweet for me, I know some people like it that way (I like mine a little on the sour side). Throw in a pretzel with their beer cheese and some grilled kielbasa and I'm one happy German camper!\\n\\nI'm a fan of their Penn Pilsner and a big big big fan of their special Chocolate Meltdown, which they debuted last Valentines Day. Now I'm telling you right now, you get yourself to Penn Brewery AS SOON as that comes out this year!\\n\\nThe other thing that's awesome about this place is that they throw a ton of events. Nevermind their month long Oktoberfest, they host bands every couple weeks that jam out inside and out. Speaking of which, they have a great outdoor courtyard for sitting with your fave brew! \\n\\nAnd to that I say, oh! oh! oh!\nSo I would like to give it",

Where's my mustard sauce? (Let the great debate begin!)\\nAnyway, I got the pulled pork sandwich with mixed sauce (they have a mild red sauce and a spicy red sauce, and mixed is... the two together), a side of cole slaw, and a side of mac'n'cheese (all three ran about $8 together). The pork was tender and had a good flavor. The sauce was very smokey and on the spicy side..not bad but could easily overwhelm the pork. I also had a bite of my friend's brisket, which wasn't nearly as good as the pork (brisket just isn't Q where I come from). The mac'n'cheese was stouffer-ish, but the slaw was great! Pretty solid.

It's American craft beer week and they are releasing a different beer for each day! \\nFood trucks often appear (I'm pretty sure most of the week now), and they partner with local talent to make beer infused popcorn, chocolates, and I've attended a dinner night at Whole foods featuring Tenaya Creek beer.\\nThey also have art night in the back, I believe once a month.\\nIt's not typical of me to make friends out in public, when when you see the same crowds, it's hard not to! So I have a whole group of friends now centered around good beer!\\nSO if you haven't been in a while here's what else to expect:\\nFood trucks visit because the kitchen has been closed since 2008.\\nThey allow you to rent out the pool room space for events.\\nLive bands play here.\\nJukebox lets you pay on your phone and remote transmit your request.\\nSpecials around \\\"holidays\\\", and I say that in quotes because beer holidays are not observed anywhere but at bars.\\nThe website is doing much better, with updates of \\\"what's on tap?\\\"...something I've always appreciated, a place letting customers know the latest brews.\\nI dont have anything bad to say :D\n\nReview rating:",

        "I am a complete fish lover.  Growing up that was my staple -- fish, all kinds of seafood, octopus, lobster, crab...I think you get the idea.\\n\\nI had passed this place on the way home one night and vowed to see what it was about.  I checked out their website -- not too shabby!\\n\\nHubby and I decided to give it a go the other night.\\n\\nWhat a disappointment.  I can't even articulate about how overcooked my food was or how meagre the service was.  I practically begged for water and silverware.\\n\\nWords cannot describe how angry I felt when I left.  The food, the service, utterly disappointing.\\n\\nI ordered their Cedar Plank Salmon.  The salmon was so overdone that the edges were past the point of crisp -- they were burnt.  I asked our server if I could please get one that was not quite so charred.  I swear she rolled her eyes at me.\\n\\nThe sides were the only highlight of that meal.  Hubby's meal was \\\"ok\\\" by his standards, but I could see a stream of resentment building in him.\\n\\nIt was a Thursday night, not too packed, but busy enough.  Our server was more concerned with her chatter with the other servers.  It's one thing to have friends at work, but you don't neglect the customer.  I saw that we were not the only ones who bore the brunt of her bad service.\\n\\nWhen my plate came back, she slammed the dish down so hard that the salmon almost fell onto the table.\\n\\nSurly much?\\n\\nI can't give this place a good recommendation.  Their beer selection was ho hum as was their mixed drinks.\\n\\nNot a place I would recommend for friends or out of towners.\nSo I would like to give it",

Cheap booze, yess!  \\n\\nI was at the end of the bar hanging out and doing some people watching.  I had been a few places before, so I was slightly lit. It seems a friendly place where one could meet some buds or make new ones.  I was a bit over dressed in a button up shirt and no friends to talk with. \\n\\nThe bar staff was friendly and easy on the eyes, and I won't complain too loudly that a few brews were lost on my ticket.  \\nMe being the honest guy I am, I informed them of it, and they rewarded my honesty by not charging me for the brews.

        "I was very surprised by all the high marks this place got.  I just recently went here with my hubs and mom.  We were very disappointed on what we got.  We went here by chance because we needed to eat, I didn't exactly know where Seafood City was, and I didn't want to drive up and down Sahara.  Coming from SD and I have many selections of different turo turo (point point) places and never really came upon a place that wasn't good.  So I didn't think much of this place on not being good.  There were ppl inside eating...\\n\\nFirst off, they make you get a tray.  The tray I got smelled like it was wiped with a wet dirty towel.  It had a disgusting sour smell and I didn't understand why they wanted ppl to eat with it.  The guy behind the counter was pretty adamant on us getting a tray.  I got the tray, but I didn't want to put my food down on it.  SO GROSS!\\n\\nWhat I got:\\nI decided on their beef steak.  The guy asked if I wanted sabaw (okay, the sauce) on my rice, heck ya!  I just wanted one entree choice with my rice.  \\n\\nWhy it wasn't good:\\nFirst, the rice.  It seemed like old rice they reheated and put too much water on because it got too dried out.  My beef steak wasn't good at all.  The sauce of the beef steak seemed too oily and it didn't taste fresh.  It also tasted like it was cooked a long time ago and just reheated.  They just looked like they cut up fresh onion and topped with it to look like it was recently cooked. \\n\\nWhat the hubs got:\\nHe got paksiw na lechon and sinigang na HALIBUT.  Yea, thats right, they put HALIBUT in with the sinigang.  I never had and now I know why.  If you're going to make any type of FISH sinigang...fricken make it with BANGUS!  I know they had bangus because they had one all fried up in the front.    \\n\\nWhy it wasn't good:\\nMy husband is on of those filipinos who love really sour sinigang.  When he asked the guy if it was extra sour, the guy had no hesitation to say yes.  When hubs went to try it, the sabaw (soup) was barely sour.  He also agreed to not eat sinigang...

Everything I would have ordered in my home town also would have been covered for a bill of about $20 instead only 1 of the four was covered and after taking 1 item off it was still just under $40. Service was fine and so was the food. I usually tip at twice the bill since I'm getting it at half price and they still do the same work that's only fair.

        "I would love to say that it's the food that gets me in the door... but it's more about the sense of history and nostalgia that captivates you when you walk into the building.\\n\\nThe food is okay. Not the absolute best in Charlotte... but also not the absolute worst. The lunch specials are the best deal. Big portions for the price. I can usually get two meals out of whatever I order. They come with a drink and a choice of soup or salad. The salad is a simple bowl of iceberg lettuce. \\n\\nMy one must get here is the cheesy garlic bread. I always order a side of marinara to dump it in. Warning: you will be charged extra for that. \\n\\nLasagna, spaghetti, cannelloni. It's all about the same. If you are not a big fan of massive amounts of melted cheesy goodness.... you may want to stick to the salad section of the menu.\\n\\nBut again, it's not so much the food as it is the place. Old-school pictures cover the walls. They even have original menus as part of the decor. Make sure to take a look at the prices from back in the day. They still use an antique register at the front check out counter.\\n\\nThis is by no means a must go to spot. But if you're in the neighborhood, stop by for a meal. The place is usually packed for lunch. It's a staple of the city's west side... serving the area for more than 60 years.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Two and a half words... \\\"gluten-free pasta\\\".\\n\\nWhen I was a kid my family would dine out 1x's a week.  My parent's idea of trying new places meant sitting at a different table at the same restaurant.  Once a place got introduced into our dining lives, we went there every week until my dad got pissed off for some odd reason, and we would move on to a different establishment.  Needless to say we ate at Spaghetti Factory many, many, many times.  I have some fond memories from this place.\\n\\nFast forward to now, many years later, I learn they have gluten-free pasta.  1 3/4 hours after finding this out, I was sitting at a table ordering gluten-free pasta with meat sauce and sausage.  I was not disappointed.  They use a corn pasta that has a very good consistency and has a very good taste... my non-gf dining partner also ordered it and enjoyed it very much.  The meat sauce was fantastic in a super salty, not healthy kind of way and the sausage... oh the sausage, so good.  Now I realize this place is in no way healthy, authentic, or \\\"italian\\\", but it's a guilty pleasure that many will like.  I especially like the prices and the decor inside, just like it was when I was a kid.\\n\\nI enjoy this place, for the memories, and now for the gluten-free pasta.  This will be a monthly place for me before first-fridays.  I highly recommend you use their call ahead seating option by phoning in before you come, it will greatly reduce your wait times.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: After two visits to this office, I called it quits.  The first time was to see her colleague who has since departed the practice.  I actually met the doctor in her office first, rather than in the exam room.  Clothed!  Me, not her.  Well both of us actually.  \\n\\nI did find the check-in process inefficient.  They give you a clunky electronic tablet to complete what is normally done on paper.  But you don't complete all your information on the tablet.  Instead, they rattle off a bunch of instructions about which parts to skip because they collect some of your info on paper.  I couldn't remember what she said by the time I got to that part.\\n\\nAs I specifically chose a physician that did not practice obstetrics hoping to minimize all the scheduling problems created by uncooperative fetuses, I was surprised by a long wait.\\n\\nBy the time I needed to return, that physician had left the practice.  For \\\"convenience,\\\" I asked to see Dr. Wilson.  I was scheduled with a nurse practitioner, Robin, instead.  Robin was fantastic, and I can only say good things about her.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I cannot say the same for the staff.  I was not advised that I would be seen at a different office than my previous visit.  The receptionist was about as unprofessional as it gets.  She couldn't even speak to me because she was too busy eating a Snickers bar.  Several employees spent more time laughing and talking hair color than actually working.  But at least they were getting paid to waste time.  I had another 45 minute wait.  When I was finally freed, the Snickers spokesperson watched me wait to check out at the back counter for at least 5 minutes before she asked if I needed help.  But my chart wasn't where it should be, so even that was delayed.    \\n\\nSo 5 stars for Robin and 1 star for everything else.  If you do decide to take your chances and want to see Dr. Wilson personally, confirm who you are scheduled to see.  Both times I called asking for an appointment with Dr. Wilson, but was not scheduled with her.  I am beginning...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The water was cold. When I go for a pedicure I mostly go for the massage, I usually pay for extra massage if needed. She was pretty much just putting lotion and the sea salt on my legs and feet. No massage or rubbing what so ever. I asked her if she could rub harder or more rough. She either didn't understand or did not want to because she just told me no and shook her head. Complete waste of time, I did not see a point since I can put lotion on my legs myself.. Also painted my toes poorly with excess polish on my skin. When it came to get my gels replaced I presented a design I just wanted something similar. He did well on the design yet painted very poorly missing the sides of my nails and the gel is not thick enough and bumpy. My nails can chip or break very easily.

        "Review text:\nI had LASIK done here in June 2012. I was initially drawn to it by Tim G's review, hoping that I would also qualify for the $299 per eye prices. Unfortunately, when I had my consultation they quoted me about $8-900 per eye for traditional LASIK. (I can't remember the exact price they quoted). My contact prescription was -2.50 in both eyes. I was a little bummed and decided that I didn't want to continue and I left. I was already starting to regret that I didn't just get it over with, as it was something I'd been wanting for awhile, when about a week later, they called me and offered me a lower price. They told me that they could do it for $599/eye for the traditional technology if I did my surgery on a specific date. I took them up on their offer and scheduled for a Friday morning. I decided to do all of my pre-LASIK appointment and my surgery on the same day, so I arrived early that morning, had everything done, spent a very long time waiting around being nervous (as your eyes can not be dilated for the surgery, and that is part of the exam to make sure you are qualified for LASIK), and then had my surgery around 3pm. I am very very pleased with my results. If you are thinking about having LASIK surgery done, I highly recommend the Lasik Vision Institute. I couldn't be happier with them!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nI have always enjoyed going to this 4-story Belk at SouthPark mall.  The parking deck parking can be a bit of a pain trying to avoid all of the valet parking places, but once you find a spot, it's thousands of square feet of awesome.  \\n\\nLast night was a particularly good trip with some great sales going on.  Belk typically has quite a selection of red dot clearance items, and last night was no different.  I purchased a Ralph Lauren dress that was originally $169 for $31 (several discounts, plus signing up for a Belk card got it down to that price)!  I also got several other work appropriate dresses for under $20 each, leaving the store with a sack full of clothes for $120.  And the salesperson, Phyllis, was an absolute delight.  She took quite a bit of time with me (it was just after work on a Friday and the store wasn't terribly busy yet) and I really appreciate the great customer service, she was fantastic. \\n\\nI walked through the shoe section, but I am beginning to think if you aren't a pole dancer, it is really hard to find shoes (this goes for the other department stores as well) and I had trouble finding anything I liked - the shoe department is large and kind of overwhelming to me.  The clearance room was busy and a mess, so I skipped that completely,.\\n\\nThe cosmetics section is huge with every brand of makeup and perfume you can think of.  The jewelry department is well stocked and well priced.  And the purses, ohhhh the purses.... I had to walk through there VERY quickly so I wouldn't take some home with me.  \\n\\nIf parking in the deck near Belk, look above your head when you walk in to see what the sign says as to where you are parking - if you walk out the wrong door, it can be a bit confusing.  Happy shopping!\n\nReview rating:",

I called salon surreal to ask how much a haircut costs there and when they told me $50 I thought that was really expensive but they were able to fit me in right away so i made an appointment. I usually pay about $30 including tip so I was wondering why they charge so much for haircuts.  My appointment was with Tasia and she was awesome. She asked me what kind of cut I wanted and I told her to do whatever she thinks will look good on me. Next step was washing my hair and she gave me a great head massage it was so relaxing I wanted to take a nap. Tasia did a great job with the cut and style and gave me tips on different ways to style my hair. She also showed me some products that I should use but wasn't pushy about selling them to me.

        "Review: I feel somewhat uncomfortable giving a so-so rating to a restaurant where I know the family personally.  That said, there's a few things that have been amiss at this place pretty much every time I come here.  The food has been average at best and the atmosphere isn't quite my thing.  Tonight exemplified this feeling for me during a dinner with family members.\\n\\nFor starters, this restaurant has been around forever.  Even many of the staff members have been here forever (our waiter had worked there for decades).  Between the long time staff and the decor, the feeling of this place is old school all the way.  It has some of the feel of an old school italian restaurant, though not so fancy that you have to be super dressy here.  In fact much of the clientele here is quite casual.  The customer crowd here has also typically been much older as I suspect many of their customers have been coming here for years.  I rarely see anyone younger than their forties or fifties in there, so interpret that however you want.\\n\\nThe food is old school classic italian from the pastas, the seafood dishes, the chicken and veal plates, and the steaks.  Tonight I went with the chicken francese.  Essentially a breaded chicken covered in a lemon butter sauce and topped with mushrooms.  First off, I'm not a mushroom guy so thats my fault.  But the chicken and breaded tasted pretty bland even with the sauce (which was way more butter than lemon by the way).  It was edible, but not that great.  I've had similar experiences with a couple of their pasta and veal dishes as well.  Each dish gets soup and a salad to start.  As usual both were okay, but again nothing special.  The prices are actually pretty reasonable so even if the flavors don't impress you, you can count on leaving full.\\n\\nIt may well be that I'm not the target audience of this restaurant.  Its an old school restaurant with old school grub, so maybe they're just looking to appeal to the old school crowd.  I'm not opposed to old world recipes as long as they're done well. ...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

It was awesome! \\n\\nFor dinner, we shared the pork tenderloin and it was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were incredible! Obviously very rich (I'm guessing cream cheese and sour cream), but they were ridiculous! \\n\\nI had been eyeing the cheese plate as many other groups were enjoying it, so we decided to take one to go! It's a bit pricey ($18), but the 4 cheeses they selected were so good (Humboldt Fog Goat with ash, Parm Reg, an awesome creamy, brie like cheese and another yummy one with golden raisins) plus it was accompanied by great, buttery toast points with dried cranberries, apricots and fresh pears, apples and strawberries. It was soo good! \\n\\nOne thing that we didn't try, but would like to, is they are known for their tarts. They have a selection of about 5 each day, with one daily special (yesterday being smores...what!?!) and they look amazing! \\n\\nSuch a great little place!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "While I love the idea of a drive-in in theory, in practice I'm always annoyed by it.  Couple that with the fact that much of Bar-B-Q King's food isn't ideal for car eating, and the experience is not necessarily the best, though I can't really fault Bar-B-Q King for that, I suppose.  The car hops are helpful and friendly, and their food is delicious.  The sauce on the dipped chicken is somewhere between a buffalo style and bbq sauce. \\n\\nIt's definitely worth the trip, but if you are from Charlotte, I'd grab it to go.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: As a lover of Italian food and an even bigger lover of not leaving my house, I decided to give this place a try! As a first impression, I think it went pretty well, and I'm looking forward to my next experience with this place. I ordered the Lasagna and an order of mozzarella sticks. My review:\\n\\nMenu/Ease of Ordering: 5/5 Used GrubHub and everything went pretty well. They have a pretty large variety of options here also, which is always appreciated.\\n\\nDelivery: 4/5 I ordered at around 7:40PM and I had an estimated time of 8:40-8:50, which is pretty standard for a delivery place. I received my order at around 8:30PM, so a little ahead of schedule. The food was nice and warm still, which is sometimes hard to do with pasta dishes. The lasagna came in a nice foil container, helping retain the heat, the stix in the standard styrofoam container. My only complaint was that some of the sauce from the lasagna leaked out onto the plastic bag and then the styrofoam from the sticks and the napkins they included. Mildly annoying, but forgivable. \\n\\nLasagna: 4/5 Pretty decent lasagna. I've had better, I've had worse. This lasagna has quite the variety of meats: sausage, beef meatballs, and ham. I've never had ham in lasagna before, but I honestly couldn't taste it in particular in this dish. I'm not a fan of sausage, and it was quite flavorful here. Which, if you're a fan of, I'm sure you'd love. The meatballs tasted nice. Quite cheesy with a decent amount of extra sauce. I don't know if I'd order this again, but it quelled my craving for lasagna.\\n\\nMozzarella Sticks: 3/5 Eh, these were just okay. They gave you an ample amount of them, but they just weren't all that great. 7 or 8 sticks and some marinara. They clearly tasted frozen and didn't have too much flavor to them. I will not order these again. \\n\\nAll in all, a pretty decent experience.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "They made my order wrong, it took so long for the waitress to come by and me to tell her that it was wrong, that everyone else at my table was almost done eating.  I told her that I ordered it without onions because I am allergic to them, and they put onions in it.  I asked her to please have them make my new order to go as everyone else was just about done eating.  I discovered there were onions in it on my third bite, it took everything I had to not get sick all over the table.  Our server told us when she brought the check and my food that they had a new chef and he doesn't read the tickets all the way through.  I am going to be sick most of the night because of his laziness.  I was really shocked and disappointed when I looked at the bill and saw that they not only didn't take my meal off the menu, they didn't even discount it!  I felt so disappointed that this restaurant that I had loved for so many years would treat me so poorly that I just paid the bill and left the replacement meal there.  I will never return and I would not recommend them to anyone.  If you want good Mexican food  in that area, try Mexteca or PoPo's.\nSo I would like to give it",

I stopped in here Sunday July 3rd since the REAL PO was closed and discovered what a delightful place this is!  Not only does it have tons of balloons and gift ideas, but miles of racks of costumes and accessories.  And sure enough, in the far back right corner there is a REAL postal counter with a scale and during business hours a REAL postman ready and wiling to help you out, sell you stamps, send your packages etc.  And it is closer and more convenient than the REAL PO with plenty of parking and little to no lines.

If some lady jumps in line to drop off her seven boxes and one of them needs to be repackaged to your specifications, put her back in line. Stop blaming your ineptness on working on camera. It's a poor excuse. It was also shameful to charge her almost $5 for three sheets of brown packaging paper. \\n\\nIf the customers are not supposed to use the mailing labels provided, why do you make them available? Either use them or replace them. \\n\\nIf you can't read my handwriting, just tell me and I will help you do your job. Stop blaming the need to verify the computer. The computer only takes what you put into it. \\n\\nClearly you can not run a store by yourself, especially in the middle of the afternoon rush when eight customers are in the store all at the same time. At least you apologized to the one customer you never helped. You said, \\\"I'll be right there\\\" and never helped him at all. He left, with a disgusted look on his face. I saw him in line at the post office. At least we know what we are in for at the post office. \\n\\nNot all employees are cut out to work in a customer service job.

        "I lived here for 10 years and never visited the botanical gardens before today. And I have no idea why, because it was a beautiful experience.\\n\\nDefinitely leave some time for your visit. We didn't dawdle and it took us at least 3 hours to explore everything (including the gift shop, which is like a garden lover's dream). Every kind of plant was clearly marked and we often found ourselves exclaiming, \\\"I didn't know there were so many different kinds of cactus!\\\" several times.\\n\\nThe paths are wide and very well maintained and the trails are clearly marked and often lead to interesting places to rest or learn about the plants that inhabit the desert areas. We went during the holiday season and the luminaria bags were set out all over the place, awaiting lighting at twilight. During this time of the year, the gardens close at 4 to prepare for this night time event, so remember to consider that when visiting. Visiting Las Noches de las Luminarias is an extra charge (and quite expensive at $30+ a ticket, but some say it's more than worth it. We skipped that part of the experience this time) and popular nights must sell out in advance because we saw several signs letting people know that the event was sold out. Something to remember. Even without being lit, the luminaria bags along the pathways were cool anyway and added to the festive scene. On a side note, who lights the over 8,000 luminaria bags anyway? Yikes!\\n\\nOverall, the gardens are beautiful and the views of the mountains that surround Phoenix are top-notch. Parking is abundant and free and there are several garden employees that were milling about, waiting to answer questions or to direct our attention to something particularly interesting.\\n\\nThumbs up and worth a visit!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: If you go here to have a mole taken off, DO NOT let one of the PA's do it (physician assistant).  He butchered me a year ago.  I have never been on Yelp but felt the need to get on here to give this place a rating to warn others.  The PA \\\"Mike\\\", tall black guy with dreads, and very lackadazical attitude, was absolutely horrible.  Very poor in communication.  Told me he was going to do one thing, but did another while under the knife.  I have 3 very horrible scars, and a 1\\\" patch of hair missing from a very small bump taken off my scalp.  He said it would just be a 3 or 4 mm diameter circle punch and one or two stiches, but under the knife he gave me just over an inch long cut with 8 stiches.  He failed to tell me the under skin stitches may try to push out of skin, which they did, caused scar tissue and permanent hair loss.  6 months later i went back to complain, and the Doctor there fixed it the best he could, for free, which is why I'm giving this place at least 2 stars.  Theres still noticable hair loss.  I'm always having to explain the HORRIBLE 2\\\" scar i have on my shoulder, which should not be there for a simple mole removal.  I'm always told I'm a good looking guy and now i have these scars.  I chose this place because they could get me in quick, within a week or so (before my insurance changed), as opposed to a reputable doctor with a waiting list of 4 months or so.  Big mistake I will always regret.  Also, the secretaries are very sub par, lazy, and the phone system sucks.  If you're on your way and can find the place, or if you need to let them know you're running late, YOU CAN'T GET THRU and theres no clear way to get in touch with someone thru the phone system.  It leads you to the wrong departments and doctor.  They also accidentally billed me twice.  If I wasn't on top of things I would have paid the $400 bill which insurance had already covered.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Before this past Father's Day,  it had been at least 4-5 years since I've eaten here. Something told me I enjoyed it before so we went there with another family to celebrate \\\"my day\\\". Atmosphere was good, greeting from hostess was fair and the waitress was very friendly. Very eclectic and interesting menu. Trying to decide between a few dishes, the waitress suggested their fish and chips.Being quite hungry, I asked if it was a fairly decent portion and she promised 3 generous portions of fish atop a mountain of fries. I ordered a house salad to start for \\\"only\\\" an extra $3.99   Now the reason some places get unfavorable reviews is because their expectations are made so much higher than what they receive. I know a Burger King double cheeseburger is not going to fill me if I order one, so I am not disappointed when I order one.\\nMy salad arrives- browning, wilted, bagged salad mix. There was not one extra thing put on this mix, no croutons, olives, tomatoes, - nothing.\\nI paid $4.00 for a plate of old lettuce that the manager should have refused to let be served-even to a rabbit.\\nMy meal arrives- A handful of less than ordinary fries with 3 fish sticks on top. I am not kidding! These 3 \\\"generous\\\" portions of fish were barely bigger than what you would get out of a Gordon's fish sticks box.   \\nthe waitress told me this was their most popular lunch item. What?\\nThe soup and sushi roll combo that my friend ordered looked decent but I wont ever find out since I will not be returning.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I kind of have a love hate relationship with US Airways. I have always found their staff to be extremely kind and helpful. I especially appreciate how patient they have been with me the many times I have found myself running late, or without a seat assignment. That along with the great prices I have gotten on my tickets give them 2 stars. \\n\\nNow here is where my strong dislike for them comes in- almost every flight I have been on, I've been bumped. They do give me a voucher to put towards a flight in the future but it doesn't fully make up for the 5 extra hours you have to spend in the airport or missing your birthday dinner you had planned at your final destination. The cleanliness of the plane is questionable. Many times I have gotten to my seat to find trash. I don't know about you but I strongly dislike having to pick up after the person who was in my seat previously. Then, the over all care for the interior is lacking. So often I have found myself on a seat that was torn or the seat wouldn't recline. \\n\\nI guess for me with flying its the little things that make a difference. It's already uncomfortable flying, the last thing I want to do is sit somewhere that adds to the discomfort of flying through the air. My rating for this place is",

I got my nails done at a beauty school and on the way out I smudged one of my nails. It wasn't a huge deal, I barely noticed it, but on my drive home I decided to stop at Sally Beauty supply to see if they had the same polish. To my surprise, they did have both nail polish colors I needed. The nail polish bottles were not labeled with a price tag, so it was kind of a shock to spend $25 on three bottles of nail polish (one bottle was only .99 cents), but I still got what I needed so it all worked out.

The place is small, and the decor isn't something to be excited about.  We tried the osso bucco and black squid ink pasta with shrimp and broccolini.  The osso bucco came out cold, which is not good.  But we told the waitress and she quickly got that taken care of.  It was good, extremely meaty, but not really worth the cost or wait in my opinion.  \\n\\nThe black squid ink pasta was very good.  It wasn't salty enough, but after we added a little on our own, it was perfect.  The saving grace that took this place from a 2 star to a 3 for me was the tiramisu.  It's the classic no frills tiramisu that I so dearly miss these days when all the restaurants try to make fancy-over-the-top ones.

And from what I see here on Yelp, I am not the only person to have issues with this company.\\n\\nTo make a long story short, here are the issues I had with this company.\\n1. They were able to change our agreement at will when it was in their best interest, regardless of the inconveniences it caused me. For example, they changed pick-up and drop-off dates/windows because they had overbooked. This left me in a difficult position because the dates of my leases were set in stone.\\n2. They indicated that I would need to pay an additional fee one day prior to the drop-off date because they felt the delivery truck was too large for the complex I was moving into. They had my new address for over a month and waited to tell me a day before the drop-off that I need to find an additional money.\\n3. Three of my large furniture pieces were damaged. They hired a refurbishment company to repair the items. When they could not repair some of the damage they offered us a check for a small fraction of what was still damaged. When I tried to dispute the offer, no one returned my emails or calls.\\n\\nDO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!\nSo I would like to give it",

My daughter and others told us how fantastic it was and I do not question their views but I seriously doubt that there will be a return visit any time soon.

When the waiter showed up we ordered our drinks and received them from the busboy in short time. We asked for a couple of minutes before ordering. The waiter annoyingly showed up within 2 or 3 minutes. We gave him our order and he kept insisting upon lobster tail and lobster bisque. We wanted steak and oysters but he kept trying to get us to take the lobster. He finally gave up and returned moments later with a bowl of assorted hard/cold bread. NO kidding, what a joke! I got served a chopped salad but my GF did not get hers. FORTY FIVE minutes into this whole deal, we decided that enough was enough. We were going to pay for what we had and leave without receiving my steak and her salad & oysters. Just then. the server showed up with our food and we decided to stay.  My filet was overcooked and worse yet, the oysters were frozen, completely encased in ice like an oyster popsicle. We showed the waiter and he cracked a joke like he could thaw them out in the microwave. He went and talked to the chef who's reply was that oysters must remain cold. I was so pissed that I figured it was not worth creating a scene and paid over $80. for food that was not as good as McDonalds.

And for the past many years, Kim Long was our choice... mainly for their wide selection of dishes and above average taste quality.  However, the past few times we have visited have proved that management has certainly taken over by greed and the need to increase prices and diminishing food quality and services.  My experience here in our latest visit was completely unpleasant as the food tasted washed down and flavorless.  It's as if the chef had to rush out so many dishes that he forgets to throw in any key ingredients.  On top of that, service was horrible to say the least.  We asked for a tea refill from 4 different servers and each and every single time we asked... the server would pass it down to another server... and then just moved on about their business to try and seat as many new customers as possible.

This is a typical \\\"authentic\\\" Mexican style restaurant named after a person (you know, Roberto's, Laurita's, Pepe's, Beto's) with \\\"authentic\\\" meaning the flour tortillas are semi transparent due to being grilled in lard. I ordered a Machaca Torta, but they gave me a Jamon y Huevo Torta. The torta bread was blackened in places which did not add to the flavor - but detracted from it. The egg was too brown too. Basically, not a good sandwich at all. My wife ordered the #8 (2 Tacos) but got a #9 (Burrito and enchilada). So, it would have been nice to get what we ordered. The cheese in the enchilada was very odd, like thin spaghetti. It retained that shape even after heating. The enchilada sauce tasted like it came out of a can. The fries were plentiful and good however. Overall, I will not go there again.

I understand things get busy, 10 minutes is a bit of a long wait with the heat. The waitress came as I was heading to the to get water from the bar. She got our order. I asked for a root beer and a burger with no onions. The root beer came late and the burger came with onions. It may have been the kitchen's fault and the food was still good. The, who I am assuming was the manager, refilled our waters because the waitress was too busy doing whatever in the back. Never got a refill on the root beer, the drink I actually spend money on. Got the bill, but the waitress went M.I.A. for 15 minutes. Finally got up to ask a bus boy where a register was so we could pay. The waitress showed up as we were talking to him. It was disappointing because we heard such great things, but we did not get a decent service.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "This has quickly become one of my fave places to stop in for a bite when I don't feel like cooking...or when I get off a plane and have no groceries at home. The calamari wasn't too bad, and I like their spanakopita. The spinach artichoke dip isn't my favorite appetizer here...I'd say choose one of the others. My fave dish is the basa fish with rice and a side Greek salad. Yum! I like it so much that I've started buying basa fish at the store and cooking it at home. \\n\\nThere's outdoor seating with sun shades for the afternoon sun. \\n\\nService can be a little slow at times, though the folks are nice. Parking is a royal pain right now due to the construction of the new Whole Foods at the other end of the parking lot. My rating for this place is",

Coming from Seattle I'm very familiar with businesses that focus heavily on locally sourced goods, fresh locally grown produce, and a strong general focus on being eco friendly while not losing their edge or charm. LGO is like a breath of the Pacific Northwest for me!\\n\\nIt's a local business that's your one stop before you head home. Whether you're hosting friends, you're looking for dinner for one, dinner for two, or just stocking up on goods, you're covered here. \\n\\nRacks of wine and champagne can be found along a few walls. On other walls and display shelves you can find great gifts or home wares, plus books, greeting cards, kid's toys, candy, and of course food!\\n\\nThere's a chilled fridge with pre-packaged foods like sandwiches and salads, there are cheese selections, pickled foods, and if you want something made to order they do that too. It's literally a godsend for anyone on the go for any meal, or just about any errand that involves impressing friends, coworkers or family. Nothing you buy here is going to waste! \\n\\nI especially loved the reversible shopping totes! The fabric so so gorgeous on both sides that your real dilemma is not about when to use the tote but which side to feature!\n\nReview rating:",

First thing you see when you enter is a big white and brown bull in the bull pen. They start off with a great family style salad, and biscuits with fried Indian bread. I ordered the 10oz Rustlers Cut Steak was amazing. It was very juicy and properly seasoned. The beans they served them with were great as well. One thing that they served that was amazing were the sweet potato fries. These bad boys were sweet and tangy, tasted just like curly fries. The atmosphere is kind of like a dance hall set up. The have a slide you can ride on to get to the second level. Yes a slide. Definitely a great family place to hit up if you are in town.\nSo I would like to give it",

If you sign a lease now it's $830. It has hardwood floors... In between the gaping crevices in the floor and splinters galore. The kitchen appliances are 3/4 size so your oven will not accept 11\\\"X13\\\" baking pans and the eyes of your stove are too close to cook more than two items at a time.\\n\\nThis past winter was very snowy, and Mozart waits until the 23rd hour after snowfall to shovel and salt the walkways, so be prepared to have several near-death experiences getting down the two flights of steep stairs (with short, flimsy, definitely not to code railing). \\n\\nThey sometimes creep in for inspections, then give you a 'B' without telling you what they didn't like. Aside from inspections, maintenance is really quick for all those pesky problems with the plumbing. The bathtub and sink drip constantly which would be concerning if utilities weren't included. The air conditioning is weak, the heat is hellish and there is very little temperature control since your windows are painted shut.  \\n\\nThe laundry room is coin operated, it costs $1.75 to wash and to 'dry'. Your clothes will still be soaking wet from the dryer (yes even on high with a clean lint trap). Also be wary of the washers, sometimes people leave them nasty so do a sniff test and a visual inspection before you put your clothes in. The hallways smell like hot garbage, always. They will only be vacuumed shortly after move in in August and right before people start coming to view the apartments in February.\\n\\nAlso, since the utilities are included, your name isn't on them which means:\\n1. When you move on, the utility companies want to say you have no history with them because your name is not on the account.\\n2.

They bumped up the cost of meters, or you can park down the road in the expensive lot. Add to this the high cost of wings with NO MEAT on them. None, seriously, anorexic little chickens all wingless for this place. And I like smaller, less fatty wings. But I also like meat. And I do not want to spend $10 on an order of wings that result in one tablespoon of meat. Second issue is that the outdoor smoking section opens into the restaurant and stinks the place up.

        "I bought a guitar online, but it needed to be set up (altered)--in particular, the action on it was too high. I brought it into Empire Music, which was my local neighborhood music store at the time. The guy who helped me--I wish I could recall his name--was nice and very helpful to me. But he also gave me his take on why it is so important to buy instruments at small, local stores in the first place, and explained that in this case it would have been in my financial interest to do so, because they sold that same guitar for that same price, but with a lifetime guarantee the online retailer doesn't offer. And he pointed out that stores like his couldn't stay alive just working on instruments bought online from big corporations, but that if his store weren't there, I wouldn't have anyone to set up my instrument.\\n\\nI have to say, he was right! I am not a person who can afford to pay some huge premium to buy the same thing at a small store that I can buy cheaper online, but he disabused me of that prejudice that the big online retailer was always going to be cheaper or the better value, even when compared with a store in a wealthy suburb like Mt. Lebanon.\\n\\nMore importantly, he was really patient and sweet, showed me some things about my guitar that were useful for me to know, and best of all did a fantastic job setting up my instrument! When I got it back it was so much easier to play and I was immediately able to spend hours practicing on it without killing my fingers.\\n\\nSo in short, if you are looking to buy an instrument and/or get work done on one, definitely think about swinging by Empire. They have competitive prices, their staff are friendly and passionate about the business, and they do good work. It is an important thing to have a music hub like this in the community.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: I was very excited to try out the Samosas here, but, the service was just horrible and the waiter seemed very rude. We went there for lunch and the lunch special menu looked OK. So we decided to order separate lunch specials. We asked the waiter that we are ordering individually and would like individual checks, but, the waiter was too dumb and rude to understand that. He kept pointing at the no separate checks sign on the wall, when we clearly mentioned that we are all gonna order a different dish and naan separately. He even said that we should get out of the restaurant and try the buffet across the street. I have never seen such pathetic hospitality in my life so far. That too opening an Indian restaurant and not knowing about the culture. We have a saying \\\"Atithi Devo Bhava\\\" which means that the guest is God and  should be treated with courtesy, but, I am pretty sure the waiter knows nothing about that.\\nAfter that we went to Rani's across the street and we were greeted with a smile and treated like a family member. And rani has authentic Indian food. tastes just like home. I have tried almost every Indian restaurant in the City so far and having so many options, I would go to Taj Palace, Ranis or India Masala for their amazing hospitality and authentic Indian food rather than Samosa factory...any day!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Say what you like about chain restaurants. I despise almost all of them. Almost. There are certain standards expected that chains rarely have the skill set to pull off. Chain diners don't fall into automatic failure, and Joe's Crab Shack also remains unaffected. \\n\\nShack, it's in the name, so you can't complain about the decor. Having been born on the east coast, my mom is from Maine-dad from Maryland, I know seafood. And you can't complain about the seafood here. The clam strips are gigantic and delicious, not sure how they could go wrong unless they were frozen, small, chewy bits of fried dough. Which they were not. The corn was very sweet for this time of year, that troubled me, but didn't stop me from eating it. The Snow, Queen, and King crabs were all delicious as well, stay safe and get old bay seasoning version. \\n\\nNow the reason for three stars. There is zero beer selection. For anyone that would like to drink a delicious draft beer paired with seafood, you will not find the non chain/shore town seafood house selection. Just the normal collection of crappy, watered down pilsners made from corn and rice. To bad they didn't start stocking Mad Dog 20/20 to match, I would have ordered a fruit punch one. Or perhaps some Boone's Farm, Colt 45, or PBR. Hold on a minute, I take it all back. I've just been informed that they have PBR.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

The bread was just ok it didn't look baked fresh, it seemed to be a kind of roll you buy at your local market that was split in half, not actual sub roll. The meatballs were sitting in what appeared to be canned crushed tomatoes, no seasoning nothing, it was pretty gross, no real italian marinara, then it had sliced onion, which was not cooked, then whatever cheese that seemed to be on it was only on the side of the sub.

But besides the plaza giving me the uneasy feeling, that even an unattractive mid-aged man could fall victim to a mid-day rape, I forged on. The rewards were less than stellar. I cruised the aisles of items looking for something I could purchase to add to my already cluttered abode. No dice. Everything is in that weird period, where it isn't old enough to be collectible, cool, or culturally relevant yet nothing is new enough to provide an upgrade. The only thing I thought was cool was a couple obscure punk CDs in the music section, but I already had the albums on my IPOD. I didn't see anyone else buying anything either but everyone did stop to talk to the old cooter working the register. He looks like he may be a plethora of knowledge and stories. I'm not trying to steer people away, just saying I didn't have any luck, but then again I didn't seek guidance from the wrinkled prophet dishing advise and offering a safe harbor to those fearing the dayrape.\nSo I would like to give it",

Checked the tires, the car, checked if the emergency park was on... Everything was 100% fine. Nothing was showing up on my dashboard. I have a brand new range rover. It should not be driving like this. \\n\\nWhen I called Freddy's, Johnny, the supervisor was extremely helpful. So I'll actually give another star just for him.

I'm never coming here for a car wash again.\\n\\nFirst of all, half the staff act a whole lot like they have better things to do than work at a car wash. Most of them are standing around, chit chatting and not doing anything to help customers. Today I decided to drive up to the pumps near the car wash center instead of the ones at the actual gas station. I thought I would save time and would have to make less stops. WRONG. I drove up to a pump turn off my car and was about to fill up my tank, and then the man standing over this podium looks at me like he doesn't understand what I'm doing there. He tells me \\\"this one is broken, go over there.\\\" Wow. Talk about manners. So why exactly is he standing there again? And why isn't the pump marked 'out of order'? I back out and pull up to a different pump. This next man was nicer, except he was so clueless. There wasn't a place to insert my card so I asked him if I can even pay right here, he says he doesn't know. But he doesn't think I can, and he doesn't know why. What? Lol.. But after he fills my tank he tells me to go all the way around and pay for both inside. Then come back to get my car washed. Which ultimately defeats the entire purpose of convenience. So I drive around to the front and after getting out of my car, I find that he didn't even put the cap back on and close it. Smh. Then when I'm inside paying I find out that what he should have told me is to leave my car there and walk in to pay, while a staff member DRIVES my car through the wash for me. So I complain to the cashier about how inconvenient this all is. She probably went out and told the guys outside because the second time coming around I pull up and I guess the manager? Comes out to tell me he's so sorry for the confusion and he \\\"upgrades\\\" my car wash. I thought that was cool but I'm still annoyed at how much of my time is being wasted. I don't understand what was so upgrading about my car wash though lol because my car was still dirty. Or was that because the man...\n\nStars:",

        "Would have given it one star but threw in an extra star cause the food was edible. I've been trying to support local restaurants more, instead of chains. Think I might go back to chains.  When I walked in here I was asked what I wanted to drink before I even sat down and was asked what I wanted to order before I'd even opened the menu. OK...so I finally get my food. I'm excited because it tastes pretty decent. As I'm getting into my 3rd bite of pancake, I smell lemon floor cleaner. Yep..the custodian thought it would be a good idea to mop the entire dining room area right in the middle of lunchtime. He even cleaned right under my table as i was eating...awesome! Lemon Cleaner, wet floor, and dirty mop does not mix with breakfast. Totally turned me off of finishing my meal. At this point I just decided to get the rest of my food to go and never return....ever.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: Sooo...I ended up here last Fri. night at around 10:30 after a total customer service fail at another bar downtown that shall remain unnamed (see my bad customer service list if you must know...)  My friend and I had just finished crawling the art galleries downtown, and were in the mood for some libations and grub.\\n\\nWe started off with some drinks.  Upon opening the drink menu, I was struck by its length and breadth.  I was initially tempted by the lavender-lemon concoction, but ultimately decided to go with a white Russian, since I'd never had one before and my lab manager had talked them up, and I enjoy my drinks sweeter as the night goes on.  It was a nice little drink--very smooth and strong, and I enjoyed the blending of the vanilla and coffee liqueur.  The best part, however, was the graham cracker crumbs on the rim!  My friend went with the painkiller, a favorite of his.  I had a sip, and it was also quite good, even though it involved coconut and I'm not usually much of a fan of coconut flavor.  Later on, he also ordered a beer (forget which kind) and a shot of yellow cake (he explained that this is a tradition because [insert backstory involving hung-over friends here]), whereas the white Russian was sufficient to quench my alcoholic thirst for the evening (I'm a lightweight when it comes to drinking).\\n\\nIn terms of food, we ordered the large plain macaroni and cheese.  (He doesn't eat much seafood, and I don't eat beef, which precluded all of the other options.)  Given that I'm a mac and cheese connoisseur, and that another friend recommended the mac here, I was excited to try it.  When it came out, it looked quite attractive, with interesting noodles and a sprinkling of bread crumbs on top (I'm a fan of bread crumbs on my mac).  While the flavor of the cheese was pleasant, the cheese:noodle ratio was way too low, to the point that I ended up scraping the plate to get enough of it to cover my noodles. This should never happen with a quality mac and cheese!  Even my friend, who'd had the side...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I am not handy whatsoever (!!!) and usually can only be dragged here to look at plants. \\n\\nSo I went there a few days ago looking for shelf brackets. I had a picture in my phone, just in case. I asked a person, who asked another person, who showed me some but then saw the picture in my phone and showed me some different ones. None of them looked close enough (I HATE returning stuff), so I said 'forget this'. \\n\\nThen I went to look at plants. I found a lovely vining plant marked from $19.98 to $6.00. Of course it rang up at $12.98 or so. I explained to the friendly young man working the garden center register, who called for assistance. That individual walked over to see the plant in question and snottily pointed to the price tag. The kid at the register told him it was wrong and where to look (based on my description) for the $6.00 sign. He found it, it was adjusted, and I went home with my plant. \\n\\nThe plant is gorgeous, otherwise I'd be pretty tempted to give them 3 stars. \\n\\n(Oh, and I found the correct brackets at a local hardware store when an old man working there saw me wandering around and chased me down to help me.

        "Review text:\nOK guys! This is a solid Yelp-recommended kappo place. I really loved the overall experience, up until the very end, when suddenly I got one unexpected & unfortunate issue with it. When we finished dinner (we had ordered a huge load of food and paid about $57 per person, for 2 people, incl. a good 18% tip) we exited the restaurant and the predominantly Japanese staff didn't say a simple thank you. The Japanese host (manager?) saw us leaving, turned a blind eye and continued chatting with the waitress as if we didn't exist.\\n\\nI regret giving you a lower rating (I initially intended a 5) but I am an emotional and spoiled client- I got upset... I'm half Japanese... I know it is not written on my (Caucasian) face, but I am. My appearance is not an excuse for anyone to forget to say a simple \\\"thank you\\\" especially when it's part of the Japanese cultural code. As we all know. Even a Korean-owned Japanese restaurant in LA area is trying to always say \\\"Arigato Gozaimasu\\\" (with a heavy accent, but still, polite and respectful). I never had an experience where Japanese nationals operating a restaurant- in the US or in Japan- disregarded this centuries-old cultural rule.\\n\\nOK... the tantrum is over now, guys- sorry. Yelp is all about being subjective and emotional about our experiences- and it is exactly what I am doing. I wish that I had the desire to write more about the food rather than freaking out regarding a cultural issue...\\n\\nIn spite of the \\\"shitsurei\\\"- hopefully an isolated incident without any mean attitude or intentions behind it- I DO RECOMMEND this restaurant as one of the good Nihon-ryori restaurants in Las Vegas. Also, conveniently, it is open quite late. Maybe other Yelpers who are less spoiled or less familiar with Japanese customs (not expecting as much from their experience) will really have a blast.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

When we first walked in, I was really confused with the layout, and we actually stood in the middle of the doorway for like 10 minutes before they bothered to seat us.  I was mostly confused because I saw like 3 empty tables.  Once we sat down, our drinks were promptly brought out to us and continually refilled.  I always appreciate that.  We ordered the mozz triangles to start because we were famished and then I got the bacon and gorgonzola burger.  The mozz triangles were really yummy with gooey cheese on the inside and surprisingly crispy outsides.  The fries with my burger were really quite good and seasoned well.  The burger is where things fell a little flat.  The meat tasted completely unseasoned and was very well done.  I much prefer medium, but there are certainly places where a well done burger can still be tasty and juicy.  This really wasn't one of them.  The burger as a whole wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  I guess I don't really understand all the love this place gets when it really just seems okay to me.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

FIRST we go out to Queen Creek, but apparently the map was WRONG on the website and the house was another 25 min drive.

Okkkk would have been nice to know that in the first place.\\n\\nAnyways we go out there figuring we might as well if the house is nice enough. Wellll he used the pictures from before the house was destroyed because when we went inside, it smelled like animal piss, the carpet was ripped up, the electricity was OFF, food splatters on the wall, dried up POOP in the toilet, I mean FILLING the toilet... someone had a horribly upset stomach. \\n\\nWe left and I told him I was pretty irritated because it was a huge waste of our time. I get that the owner has to get the property cleaned up... but as a realtor, WHY WOULD YOU SHOW THE HOUSE IN THAT STATE?!

We recently tried their breakfast buffet on Sunday mornings and aside from their usual salad bar they have wonderful options like belgium waffels, french toast, a breakfast buritto bar, and the most addictive cinnamon rolls. Go after a morning run so you won't feel guilty eating those!\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nI will be upfront in saying that I have worked for the Arizona Science Center as a Summer Camp Instructor, so my review may be biased.\\n\\nThe ASC has a beautiful facility. True, some of the exhibits are better than others, but each exhibit has a goal of education in mind. I've found that children get the most out of the ASC when their accompanying adult takes the time to talk to them about what they are experiencing (even if it means reading the sign next to the display), rather than just letting the kid run around like a maniac. The ASC also has an awesome planetarium which is definitely worth checking out, along with the IMAX theater.\\n\\nI most recently visited the ASC for their educator preview of Body Worlds. The Body Worlds exhibit alone is worth visiting the Arizona Science Center, if only to open your mind to the complexity of your body. (Don't be ignorant! Learn something for a change!)\\n\\nWhat makes the ASC so great in my opinion is what they do for continuing science education. Have you ever had the opportunity to take a course at the ASC? Or a summer camp? The Arizona Science Center goes out of its way to make it an incredible learning experience for you or your child. They have rooms in their basement packed full with science equipment, alongside other enormous rooms where they build the next exhibit. ASC's goal is to educate Phoenix (children and adults) about science and nature. This means that the Arizona Science Center will continue to grow and prosper as Phoenix does - therefore we can only look forward to bigger and better things!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "I really have a love/hate relationship with sleepy poet, but in a good way.\\n\\nIt usually starts off with a dose of guilt that I'm not going to 1510, but some days I just need to see 8 million booths of stuff, always changing with varieties in prices (though usually still on the higher side) and different people to talk to. Plus, there is the perk of being able to comparison shop within the same building (if I can remember where the first booth I saw it in is located) and more than likely I can find what I'm searching for (or not really searching for). \\n\\nMy occasional problem with the tons of booths, the large clothing section, the records, the fabrics, the jewelry, and the insane amount of books is about half to three quarters of the way through sometimes my brain just can't compute any more antiques, especially if I haven't been in in a while. There is so much crammed into this place it is insane, and on occasion I need a break. (thank you conveniently placed soda and vending machine) \\n\\nThe staff is really helpful, and instead of me finding my way to the front to put down my items and then trying to find the aisle that I left off on, more often than not an employee will pass me and offer to take my handfuls up to the front and save it in a cubby with my name on it until I can make my way back up there. Love it. And although some of the prices are higher, almost everything is in fantastic shape - and there are awesome deals hidden among the higher priced tags.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "My hubsicle and I went to Grape Street for the first time earlier this week.  Ambiance was great; service was good.  Food was okay. We went during happy hour and had 4 appetizers: baked brie, mussels, shrimp with crab, and calamari.  Baked brie was by far the best, although it was a bit too sweet and the apricot preserves overpowered any taste of nuts or caramelized onions.  My husband commented that the mussels (7 for $14) lacked freshness and were a bit tough (as though they had been overbaked in the oven). The shrimp (7 for $14) was okay but a bit misleading: should have been called shrimp with bread crumbs rather than shrimp with crab (we couldn't taste the crab at all). Calamari was good/average (I've had better, but I've also had worse).  My husband loved it; I thought the coating could have been crispier.  The best part of the calamari was the Rhode Island sauce (jalepenos/peppercini peppers). Summary: ambiance great, wine list good, but food average; would recommend going only for happy hour or with a Groupon. My rating for this place is",

        "Review text:\nNEVER AGAIN!\\n\\nTook 1 of my cars here to get the annual state inspection.  Told the guy behind the counter that I know it is a very old car, probably a lot could be done on it, but the KBB is just over a $1,000, and that I did not use it very much at all.  Just wanted it to pass inspection so I could keep it and use it to haul stuff.  After about an hour wait, he came back and said if failed inspection and he had 3 sheets of print outs of what needed to be done.  I confirmed with him that everything on the print out needed to be done in order to pass inspection.  He confirmed and I told him I was going to decline as I knew it wouldn't be cheap.  A neighbor recommended I try his place, so I went there, told them my situation and left him my car.  He called the next day and told me it needed $16 worth of parts in order to pass.  All told, it cost me $60 to pass inspection.\\n\\nI then went back to AAA on Independence and asked them for an estimate on my work order.  Total estimate was right around $1,100.  I, once again confirmed with him that it was all necessary in order to pass inspection.\\n\\nIn the politest way I could, I told him my situation and that I was showed him the Passed certificate for the inspection and that it only cost $60.  He gave me some typical responses as I knew he / they would:\\n -  \\\"We at AAA really don't like to do State Inspections.  We know that other repair shops see the inspections as 'cash-cows'\\\"\\n-   \\\"There is a lot of 'grey areas' when it comes to the inspections\\\"\\n\\nI was ok with everything that he said until he looked at the date of my visit and said \\\"I wasn't here that day, otherwise I could have worked with the inspector to see about 'just getting it passed'\\\".  Problem:  he was there that day, b/c I asked him a question about the other car that my wife brought in to get inspected!\n\nStars:",

Like the other reviewers - it was barely busy when I pulled in. To be specific, I was the only car in line, and 3 dudes were waiting inside. Perfect. Do you know I was STUCK there, waiting, for  55 minutes? Almost an HOUR??? Was FREAKING out. When you get there you pull-up on the right side; then the car gets pulled behind the building in back. Then it re-appears over on the left side: The Parallel Universe where Time Stands Still, additional cars appear out of nowhere, and YOUR car is STUCK - for an hour! Seriously, thought I was loosing my mind and watching a 3-minute video loop on \\\"repeat\\\" - I SO couldn't imagine what these people were doing with their spray bottles and towels, over & over to these cars - for an HOUR. Of course, then I realized that most car places have 2-3 dudes per car, per lane. THIS place had 5 people - across 3 lanes - all sharing cars. You do the math. All I could do was stare at MY car - 1-car BEHIND the Parallel Universe of other cars - Stuck and Untouched. It seemed they had some \\\"system\\\" they working to, but OBV it DOESN'T WORK if a) You're WAY understaffed and b) the person who paid for the $23 package has to SIT and wait while 5, $10 packages go BEFORE her!!\\nI mean, what the FREAK?

Each item we ordered was flavorful on many different levels. this is definitely a Quality over Quantity kind of place. Also, the Specialty drinks were Legendary. That's about it. \\n\\nThe Bad... Price. More to the point, we dropped about $300 w/ wine and drinks and I was still hungry. We had their full experience menu. Also the service was attentive but not friendly at all. In fact, they were very pretentious. (I had to look that word up) On the Price to experience ratio, this place just isn't worth it. It is however, the kind of place that most guys will end up having to go to. I would avoid this at all cost. There are plenty of other places that serve food that is just as good and isn't as snobby as this place. I would give it one star but seriously, the food tasted great. However the small paper thin strip of Salmon was literally the size of a notepad. You can display it however you want but charging these prices is just not for 95% of us.\n\nReview rating:",

Unfortunately the pretzel sandwiches were disappointing. The have all the sandwiches pre- assembled  in the display case and when you order them they microwave them-- which heat them up but made everything soggy.

Everyone will give this place a bad rating because of how beat up and aged this place is but lets be honest here.  The place is a chinese joint, very little focus to the aesthetics and I know very few places that are this old and still around.  \\n\\nThe Food is good, say all you want about the details in the restrooms and the side rooms but the food is very good.  We ordered multiple items and they have some great dishes, my favorite is the lo mein (catonese style) the pork selections where also yummy.  \\n\\nThis place reminded me of my local chinese place in LA when I was a kid and I will look forward to coming back.

We ordered chili and cornbread, nachos, and a hamburger. The nachos and hamburger were good. The chili was really spicy and low on beans. The corn in the cornbread was hard. The drinks, served in small mason jars cost $2.50 each. My lemonade tasted like it was from a mix. Our waitress ( a tall brunette in her 20s) seemed put out. She didn't ask us if we wanted drink refills or a to-go container. I had to go up to the counter to ask for the latter. The big smiley-face she drew on the bill didn't compensate for the absence of the real thing. She was lucky I left her a tip. I wish people would realize that their behavior can have a negative effect on customers. What should have been a fun trip  was spoiled by high prices and bad service. I should add that the blond girl (hostess?) was great! She was enthusiastic, friendly and hard-working. I wish I could have given her the tip instead!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

This visit was extremely quick as they weighed, measured, and checked my blood pressure.  They also influenced me to get the Flu shot, as they explained people had died from the flu at that point in the year. \\n\\nI paid my co-pay and left, planning to return in the future for a full physical.  A few days after this visit I found out that my HR department had made a mistake during my enrollment, and they made the mistake of showing no coverage for my domestic partner (my girlfriend) and I.  I was forced to place a dispute with my HR, which was a 30-45 day process.  \\n\\nOn 02/11/13 I received a phone call from Amber Perez from Warner Family Practice stating that I owed a balance of $227.00. I explained the situation I was in, as my HR had been taking the payment out for the Health Coverage all along and currently, as well as having AETNA cards.  I explained that I was in the middle of an appeal with my HR and that within a couple weeks it should all be fixed.  I also explained that I would willingly pay if for some reason they didn't fix the coverage, but I did not want to pay until this was over as it would be a nightmare to be reimbursed.  She coldly stated that they would not do that and they can arrange payment arrangements, and she will be mailing me a bill. \\n\\nI called after work days after receiving the bill hoping to speak to someone else to explain the situation.  There was never an answer and I left a voicemail asking for a call back, which I never received.  Below I have shown emails from Ms. Perez.  I sadly purchased a home just behind this office and planned to have them as my family's doctor.  But after this HORRIBLE treatment I would NEVER recommend anyone to go this money-hungry office.\\n\\n\\n----\\n\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nI called on Tuesday at 430pm and left a voicemail with my telephone number.

I read up on some places in Chandler, and this was the closest one to the job.\\nThis was a while back, but from what I can remember, the pho was good-not the best-but good.  They gave me all the fixins, the broth was just right, meat was tender, and the noodles were cooked just so.  \\nThe service was...interesting.  I won't say its bad, its just very non-chalant.  Kinda breezy.  I'll leave it at that.  And since service is so important to me, I had to give the place 3 stars.  \\nThe decor and actual building don't garner a comment from me.  I couldn't see anything anyway after the steam from my pho clouded my glasses up.  \\nWhat can I say?  I went there for pho and got satisfied.  Not the best I had, but it hit the spot.  The menu looked like it had some awesome stuff on it though, however the prices aren't the greatest.  Honestly, I should try this place again and review it afterwards.

We walked in to the huge restaurant and were seated right away.  I loved the high ceilings and silly stereotypical Mexican decor.  Sombrero anyone?  We were then given the essential salsa and fresh tortilla chips (another reason I have a love/hate relationship with this place...) which just seemed to scream my name once they hit the table.\\n\\nI ordered the Salad Carbon-Marinated grilled chicken grilled up and then layered over fresh salad greens and veggies with an avocado slice.

        "Review: I ordered a dog bed online and after a month they inform me it is not available online.  \\n\\nNo problem.  They sweetened the message with a 20 percent off which worked for a pair of shoes I found already on sale.  What a deal! I ordered them, got them delivered to the store to find they are too big.  I then asked the manager if I could exchange those for a similar pair, which was about 1 dollar more.\\n  \\nHe set up the order then charged me 7 dollars.  I asked if I could apply the discount that was offered to me.  He said no because the discounts cannot be used on sale items.  I said I used it on the previous pair of shoes, which were on sale.  He then said he could not do it because \\\"then it would be applying it again and again...\\\" or something of that nature which made no sense.   \\n\\nI finished the transaction not wanting to argue.  I  then realized the stupidity of doing business with someone who obviously does not value me as a customer and went back for a full refund.  \\n\\nI realize this seems trivial but from the start he was rude.  If he was friendly and open as most (if not all) the associates at REI the whole situation would have been different. \\n\\nI am returning the other items I ordered on the original order as well. \\n\\nCustomer service means everything to me. I can find those items somewhere else. \\n\\nIn the past REI has gone ABOVE AND BEYOND to serve its customers.  I am not sure where they got this guy or if he is having a bad day or maybe I hit him wrong. \\n\\nIt is too bad I will do business elsewhere in the future.  I do not want to do business where I encounter such attitudes. \\n\\n I wanted to add that everyone else I saw in the store today was VERY NICE and a pleasure to do business with.  It is too bad I am not sure what happened with that guy....?\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I don't live in Pittsburgh, but I spend a few months a year here, and I've been looking for the right place to adopt as my \\\"finish the dissertation\\\" hangout. Tonight, I popped into the Beehive, and I thought I had found my place -- great prices, laid-back vibe, and really awesome spiked coffee drinks. So, I ordered my Irish coffee and settled in to get some work done. All was great until about 9:30 pm, when the music and noise from the attached bar officially reached the \\\"obnoxious\\\" level. Seriously, am I that old?!? I mean, it's a Thursday...and it's a COFFEE SHOP. It's totally cool to have a bar next door, but why must the door remain propped open? I even closed it at one point, and then they opened it back up again. It totally killed the vibe of the room I was in. If I wanted a \\\"thirsty Thursday\\\"-style dance party complete with horny and drunk college kids in heels they can't walk in, I would have gone next door. So, now I have to re-think my first impression. I would have given this place five stars if it weren't for that issue. Can someone who works there explain this, please??\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Anyone who has tasted real buttercream knows that it is not as shelf stable or white as shortening frosting and tastes like real butter.  The chocolate cake has some kind of flavoring in it.  Fake rum, maybe?  I really think people buy these cakes because they don't know any better.  Perhaps the term \\\"buttercream\\\" is used loosely outside of Europe, but true buttercream is not a concoction of Sweetex (sweetened shortening, commercial grade) and some other fake ingredients.  Carl also is very stuck in his ways when it comes to design.  He's not on the cutting edge, he will only do certain designs that he's been doing since the 80s.  There will be no rolled fondont ribbons or pulled sugar flowers or bright colors.  If you want a simple cake, and don't mind that it is frosted with fake buttercream because that's what is more shelf stable and easy to work with, then go to Carl's.\\n\\nI see that since I posted my review Deb R. from Carl's Cakes commented.  Thanks for your comment and those pictures.  I can definitely tell which ones Carl decorated as opposed to other cake decorators working there.

The decor is spare but attractive, the place seems clean enough to me, the prices are good, and I've never had a bad meal there over the past 20 years.  My current favorite is the mussels, either ginger-and-onion  or black-bean.  The mussels are big and plump and plentiful, nicely presented and piping hot.  My friends have liked their dishes, too.

        "Review text:\nA couple days ago I walked into my garage before work and noticed that there was 2 feet of water on the floor. The water heater had blown it's top and was shooting water like Old Faithful. When I opened the garage door to let the water out, the current grew so strong that it washed me out with it. I went to Lowes to buy a new water heater, and the guy working there was pretty helpful. He told me that there was no delivery charge for the water heater so I was pretty happy. When I was just about to pay, another worker comes up and tells me that there is a $68.00 charge for delivery. It's common to find workers who aren't on the same page here in Summerlin. Summerlin has very incompetent service at most places(and when I say most, I mean ALL). Living in Summerlin is basically like living inside a Special Ed class at a middle school. Well, I then decided to throw the water heater on top of my very small but gas efficient Toyota(the water heater wouldn't fit inside), and drive back home. While I was in the parking lot I got approached by a pretty girl wearing hollister jean shorts and a shirt that looked like it was from Forever 21. I could see her smartphone in the back pocket of her jeans, and she seemed really well groomed... but she asked me for money. I was like: \\\"Are you f*cking joking me? You ain't homeless. Your just too lazy to get a real job!\\\" Then less than like 5 minutes later another f*cking guy comes up to me and tells me that he is a college student who is trying to get donations so that he can pay for tuition because he can't get a student loan. What the f*cking f*ck? I thought Jesus(aka Obama) passed some kind of law that made it mandatory for colleges to give student loans to their students? I was under that perception because all the f*cking college kids who are d*ckriding Obama have been saying that for the last 3 months. Well, I didn't tell this guy to f*ck off, I just told him to vote for Mitt Romney.  \\n\\nWhen I took the water heater out of the package I noticed that it did not come with...\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review: I am from San Francisco on business in North Scottsdale, and I saw this restaurant on Groupon. I was able to purchase the groupon for $40 worth of food and drink for $20 and was very excited about it! When I got there at 7:30 on a Tuesday night, the place was pretty dead. There were about 5 tables filled out of 25 or so. An older couple came in and knew everyone, so were obvious \\\"regulars\\\", and they seemed to love the place. I ordered the White Bean Soup and the Ribeye steak with Gorgonzola sauce. The White Bean Soup was piping hot and delicious. The little bit of shredded Parmesan that melted into my spoon made the soup delectable. A waiter notified me shortly after I ordered that the ribeye was not available as the meat guy hadn't come. He substituted the porterhouse at no extra charge with the same Gorgonzola sauce that would have been on the ribeye. The steak was okay. The sauce was good, but the Gorgonzola overpowered the flavor of the steak. The steak was a little thin (hence why I'd rather have a thicker Ribeye than a thinner porterhouse). The roasted potatoes that came with the dish were delicious and the vegetables were tasty. I took 2 stars off for ambiance, not having the ribeye, and just overall satisfaction with the meal. I feel that if I had the ribeye, this might have been a 4 star.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

And lucky for me, I was able to experience both! Free limo ride to the club and they pick you up from wherever you're at. Cover is $25 which includes 2 drinks but not gratuity.\\n\\nIf you wanna see the male strippers, they take you up the elevator and you'll walk into a room filled with screaming, howling women. The vibe is more fun up here. The guys bring chairs up to the stage and grab birthday girls and bachelorettes to perform lapdances while the entire crowd goes wild.\\n\\nThe waitress upstairs was beyond rude. Not only did she question the drinks that we ordered, but basically ordered our drinks for us. On top of that, she FORGOT some drinks. If you're going to suggest how we want our drinks to be made to make YOUR job easier, at least get it right. No apologies, just a scoff and returned to slam our drinks on the table. AND the drinks tasted like shit. I should've just stuck with soda. Our table was still filled with half the drinks when we left to have a better time downstairs.\\n\\nDownstairs with the female strippers has a more sexy, laidback vibe. The girls are just funner to watch because they're more graceful. They have that pole dancing advantage and I love watching them climb up and twirl upside down!

Service is quick and friendly. The lunch specials are amazing deals and there's enough variety there that I never get bored with the choices. Their tempura is the best i've ever had, and the rest of their food is just as amazing. Their ginger dressing makes me want to drink it straight. Even thinking about it has set me drooling!\n\nReview rating:",

        "Located in a run-down shopping center off Charleston and Arville, I really like the family atmosphere of this place. 3 generations of women come together to coif pooches of all sorts.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I have a Bichon Frise. His name is Jacques, yet as adorable as he is he has the WORST hair of any breed of dog (save a Puli, perhaps). So, when I asked them to groom my unkempt puppy I knew it would take some work. \\n\\nI was quoted a price of $30-$60,and I thought ,\\\"Wow! That's quite a range!\\\"  I was told , \\\"Very few have been charged the highest price\\\", but I guess I was one of the lucky ones: 60 BIG ONES!\\n\\nHalfway through the grooming session I got an angry and frustrated call from Mama groomer Betty saying that Jacques hair was a \\\"horrible matted mess\\\" and she couldn't comb through it. I told her that it was OK to trim it a bit to make it easier to manage.\\n\\nWhen I picked up my puppy he looked like he was ready for a school photo. They did trim his ears into the Little Dutchboy shape that is so common for Bichon Frises, but i SPECIFICALLY asked them NOT to do that.\\n\\nAll in all, I  would try this place again as long as I let them know up front that it's OK to cut my puppy's hair. I know his mane is a mess, but who has time to brush their Bichon 3x daily?! \\n\\nI'm all for giving small businesses a chance, and this is one of those types of family places I just can't help but love. You can tell they're genuine animal lovers and they treat the pets with care.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

We sat at the counter with the kids and watched the food being prepared as we waited.  1/2 the people there were eating breakfast and it looked GOOD.  The sausage gravy poured all over hashbrowns looked so appealing to me.  Talk about a hangover breakfast!!\\n\\nMy veggie burger with american cheese, 2 kinds of mild chili peppers, sauteed mushrooms and all the fixings was fabulous.  All except the mushrooms which were canned.  Yuck!  I won't order mushrooms there again.\\n\\nEveryone else had regular cheeseburgers and were satisfied.  \\n\\nThe french fries were so good.

        "I love divey sushi bars, the more hole-in-the-wall, the better. I love discovering that they also have amazing sushi at good prices. I wanted so much to fall in love with this place. And yet, that didn't happen.\\n\\nThe Good:\\nThe interior is surprisingly traditional, clean, and inviting. The staff is friendly, the fish is fresh. They were willing to make me a take-out order just before closing, and were quite polite. Crab is real crab, not imitation krab mix, which was a nice change of pace and unexpected given my assumptions about the location.\\n\\nThe Not-So-Good:\\nLocated in a run-down plaza anchored (if you can even say that) by Jimmy Johns and little else, exterior is not at all inviting. Menu features about an equal division of traditional rolls, about a third baked/fried, and variations of the California roll. Found sushi menu fairly boring and (again, based on my expectations given the exterior) overpriced. Majority of rolls other than simple maki-style were over $10, and they were small. \\n\\nOrdered a California roll and a Rimba roll (scallop, crab, cream cheese)- rolls were very similar, given that they both had crab. Scallop was minimal, but crab was fresh and genuine. But I didn't expect to spend $16 (including tip) on just crab, and such small portions at that.\\n\\nAfter placing my order, noticed DS#5 (dinner special #5) in the regular menu, that looked like a much better value: two pieces each tuna, yellowtail, and salmon nigiri, plus a California roll, and soup, for $16. Sounded like a better deal but felt it was too late to change my order, especially being that they were at closing time. \\n\\nHighly suggest they move to another location, and either lower their prices or up their roll sizes. Keep friendly staff and clean, traditional d\\u00e9cor scheme. Also consider increasing hours- they are closed Sunday and only open til 9PM other days, which is fairly early. No business at 8:30 on a Friday night, not sure how they turn a profit. Then again, maybe that's why the prices are so high.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

We had put our name in online, got seated within 10 minutes of arriving which was 20 minutes before our saved time. \\nThe hostess was joyful and handling the holiday pressure really well.\\nThe server was attentive but not in our faces too much, actually suggested one of my favorite wines, and was quick when it came time to pay the bill. \\nThe food was cooked to perfection (we both tried the portabello filet with garlic mashed and steamed veggies.) The only food item that could have been done better was the asparagus; it was a bit tough. We carried a slice of raspberry cheesecake home with us for later and enjoyed that, too! \\nThroughout the visit, the manager was checking on her employees and complimenting them on their attention to the needs of the restaurant, which I think was a great morale booster! I'm so happy to say our last meal of 2014 was a wonderful experience on so many levels!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

First we get sat, waited a good 10min before our server showed up. I ordered CHICKEN STRIPS & FRIES. my gf got the 2x2x2. We waited another 20min or so to get our food. Of course what does she bring me, a chicken quesadilla. LOL oh yea that's right i forgot to clarify with my server that when i said chicken strips and fries, i really mean chicken strips and fries! Not a crappy quesadilla. She didnt come by our table for another 10min, and by then i didnt want to wait another 15-20min for my correct order to come out so i made due with the junk infront of me. Yea it was junk, scraps of chicken that looked like it was microwaved or something, with tomatoes and cheese. One of the 4-5 slices didnt even have the crappy chicken in it!?!?!! LOL\\nso.....idk like i said, you must lower ALL of your expectations when you go to IHOP this late, especially if you're not ordering breakfast items. So i guess in a way this is my fault for not expecting even worse.......but don't get me wrong, IHOP is good for breakfast, and i'd normally give it 4-4.5 stars\n\nStars:",

And that's damn near impossible to compete with. \\n\\nA quaint little spot for a date night in Downtown Chandler, yet affordable. Very charming d\\u00e9cor inside. Yes, the paper table coverings are annoying and scream \\\"MACARONI GRILL!\\\", but that's the least of your worries when you come to a place like this.  \\n\\nEvery time we go here, we always have the same server. Feeling like an idiot because I can't remember her name! She always recommends great wine for us, and is even generous enough to let us taste before committing to a bottle or glass. \\n\\nThe last time I was in five or so months ago, found out that LSCR started making their own bread. Better than whatever they had before! Always comes out fresh, warm and fluffy. Have to get that thing out of sight after a piece it's that good. \\n\\nThe few times we've been here we've tried the Ravioli Di Patate Dolci Giapponesi Al Gorgonzola, Risotto Agli Scampi and Costolette D'Agnello alla Griglia,  and a Manicotti that was on special. \\n\\nEverything was excellent; however, our absolute favorite was the first thing I listed: Japanese sweet potato ravioli in a Gorgonzola cheese cream sauce. WOW! \\n\\nDefinitely need a nap after this rich dish. Still haven't gotten around to recreating it at home. The sweet potato blended surprisingly well with something as rich as Gorgonzola. \\n\\nIf you want to do dessert, try the Chocolate Souffle. Hello, dark chocolate heaven! Make sure you give your server a heads up, as it takes 15 minutes for this one. Patience! \\n\\nGreat selection of after dinner drinks too. Think grappa and homemade limoncello!\\n\\nThe almond flavored grappa was awesome.  Brought back memories of visiting family in Varrazze 7 years ago...\n\nStars:",

        "Okay, let me first admit that going to Lee Lee's is a cultural food experience like none other in that they have their dry goods shelves broken down by country so if you are looking for say staples or delicacies found in the Philippines, you can follow the signs to that area and half the fun of Lee Lees is just looking at all of the different food stuffs and wondering what one could make. If diversity of Asian food items is your key criteria or if you are from that part of the world and want to find food items you can't find anywhere else, this store is probably a godsend.\\n\\nAs for me, I was surprised at how little I did buy because I couldn't figure out what to do with it and I grew up in Hawaii, so I'm pretty familiar with Asian food from any number of countries but mostly with Chinese and Japanese cooking. I actually find Super L Ranch Market on 44th Street, at the COFCO center, to be a better selection of Asian food items with which I'm familiar and thus, Lee Lee's probably suffers by comparison.\\n\\nI did however, find some great Jamaican hot sauce with Scotch bonnet peppers and mustard that just rocks and maybe that is the whimsical delight of visiting a story like Lee Lees, in the modified words of Forest Gump, Lee Lees is like a box of chocolates, many of which you have never heard of or imagined could exist and thus, you never know what your going to get.\\n\\nBottom line, for anyone who is a bit of a foodie, Lee Lees will be an experience and worth checking out. I have a feeling many of you will find it be 4 or 5 starts but the wonder of Yelp is that when it comes to ratings, you get to be you and speak from your own box of chocolate experience. Nuff said!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: So I really wanted to Yelp something today. So, a buddy (@groovypucks) and I went to Thai Lahna.  I noticed it had a LOT of reviews and still maintained a pretty reputable score!  Hey, its only a block or two from work, so why not?\\n\\nWe get there and are immediately seated which in my opinion is rare.  For the rave reviews, I noticed it was kind of 'dead' for a lunch crowd.  A few old people and the owners were all I really noticed.  We get a booth seat (I love booth seats.  If I could work, sleep and eat in a booth seat, I would die a happy man) so I am already getting excited.  Groovypucks and I take way too long looking at the menu and finally decide on our dishes (which we accompanied with a Thai Tea).  I asked to make my curry spicy(#36 Yellow Curry Chicken with Green Beans), and it WAS!  Almost too spicy, but I attribute that to my lack of experience with their dishes.  If I were to order it again, I would order it medium.\\n\\nGroovy got a Peanut and Chicken dish (#35) with onions and peppers.

Tomorrow brings the cooler, more rainy weather we'd been so accustomed to before this autumnal respite.  I had one last chance to dine al fresco today.\\n\\nSo which type of fare would be best for outdoor dining?  Hotdogs?  Nah, I'd already done that.  Hoagies?   Hey, now we're talkin'!  MMMM!  To quote Adam Sandler, \\\"Hoagies-n-grinders, hoagies-n-grinders\\\" (but no navy beans, navy beans!).  Villa Reale may be a typical downtown pizza shop, but they've got good hoagies here.  I went for the 6\\\" pepperoni topped lettuce, tomato, onions & cheese and a brewed ice tea.  It was the perfect way to end a season of outdoor lunches.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nThis place is supposed to be all about the tacos and between the meat choices and tortilla choices I think you could have around 10 different tacos, but they are traditional tacos with just meat, onions, and cilantro inside of 2 small tortillas (corn or flour.)  The problem with this is that I can't eat onions or cilantro... at all... I hate them.  So, I went with tostadas.  I had 1 chicken and 1 carne asada.  I enjoyed both very much!  The tostadas are very simple; layered bottom to top are: tostada shell, beans, meat, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes.  Both the chicken and carne asada were very flavorful, and while the beans were a bit watery, they tasted really good as well.\\n\\nThe place is tiny and crowded, but the service is very friendly and I think the quality of the food makes up for the downfalls.  This is probably my favorite Triple D place so far.\n\nStars:",

They were professional, so nice, easily scheduled me in and numbed me so much that I didn't feel a thing.  Although I had 7 cavities filled (my teeth are horrible) I felt good that they did a good job.  Flash forward 3 months later, I received a bill in the mail because my insurance downgraded and no longer covered white fillings.  First, I was very upset that I was never told of this downgrade.  I was given an estimate and paid on time in full - not sure when this changed or why I was never told by the office or insurance company.  Regardless, I called over 5 times to discuss a payment plan with the office.  When I first emailed them, I was told I could choose the amount with which I wanted to pay to cover the amount owed.  Then, I was told my amount was too low and would get a call back.  NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN.  I was very upset.  I emailed, and called so many times.  Meanwhile, I have always paid everything on time and as an upstanding person would never not pay a bill.  I have been sending them checks and they are cashing them and just not even saying a word.

The ice cream for dessert was premium.\\n\\nThe highlight, of course, was the music. The organist has the capability to play anything. I am sure there are exceptions, but he handled many of the requests we submitted and played music I would have not thought possible with the organ. He played big band music, Broadway musicals, movie music including Disney songs and symphony music, as well as some pop songs (Michael Jackson's Thriller). Music included lights, a cat puppet show for the song \\\"Alley Cat\\\", and even bubbles for \\\"Under the Sea\\\".\\n\\nConversation was difficult during the music show, but that's to be expected and did not detract from our enjoyment.\\n\\nAll food/drink purchases are cash/debit only.

It used be the smallest little hole in the wall and is now a great place to eat when downtown.\\n\\nIt can be a bee-yotch in a half to find a parking space on the street so I always head straight for the garage. When you enter the doors, it's a large place from another time.\\n\\nAnd this is so because this place hasn't been redecorated since before I was born! I admit it's not the chicist place, but then again, pretentious places suck! But if you go, I insist on a booth near the window! It's a great feeling, so just sit and relax in the indirect light and munch on the free chips and salsa (which is BEST when the two salsas are mixed together with a light dash of salt! I prefer two parts mild to one part hot!)  cuz well... it might be a while before your server will come to take ur order!\\n\\nThe service isn't the greatest and I don't recommend going when in a rush. I particularlly like the combination dinner. You can any three out of several items with rice & beans. My fav is two beef tacos, cheese enchilada w/ rice & beans. :) Sometimes when i'm the mood for something different, I get the Greek Gyro platter! it's AMAZING!!

        "I had heard a lot of great things about this place and the Hillstone group in general ever since I moved here so I finally went to Houston's and was disapointed.  The menu was a bore and a snore and lacking options which is fine if the few things you have on the menu are truly amazing.  I ordered the filet mignon by default because there wasn't anything else that grabbed my attention.  Also everyone said the steaks were amazing.  When the food got there I was excited.  The steak looked beautiful and when I cut into it, it looked like a perfect medium rare.  I was impressed until I took a bite.  Yikes.  I don't know if it was just the particular piece of meat I had or what but the taste was weird and bad.  It had the taste that steak gets when you try and re-heat it in the microwave.  I tried several bites hoping it would get better and it didn't.  Luckily the monster baked potatoe was great.  I am not sure if my steak was undercooked then they tried to quickly compensate and nuke it real quick.  I have serious doubts that any established steakhouse would do that but.... something was off about my steak.  The boyfriend got the ribs whom the server swore were the best in town. Lies.  Ribs were not fall off the bone tender and not very meaty.  On the positives portions were huge so you get a good value for the price... that is if you like what you're eating.  I probably will not return even though I feel I should give the steak another try.  Hillstone group so far is just mehhh My rating for this place is",

        "I finally found someone who would go to Hooters with me.  Yeah, I said it.  We sat down in a low table and scoped out the TVs.  Me?  There to see the Big 10 championship of course.  I asked our nice waitress once.  Twice.  Couldn't find a manager.  Asked again.  Got a new waitress, Brie.  Asked Brie.  She went in search of the elusive remote.  Like a rock star, Brie climbed up to the HD monolith and changed it herself.  Big kudos to this little lady.  And a big tip.  Steamed Shrimp wasn't as fresh as I've had before but the loaded tots were DELISH.  Some may find it odd that I get shrimp at Hooters, but I alsways. do.  My male companion's boneless wings were yummy too.  Crispy and juicy.  I won't be back to this Hooters but I'll continue to patronage when I can convince someone to go with me.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "It was nice that this place was a venue that participated with the Las Vegas Power Pass.  Being on vacation I like finding deals that keep me on a budget especially with 2 children. The Power Pass included 2 ride tickets, 6 tokens, a personal sized 1 topping pizza and a small drink. Because we had multiple days on the Power Pass it resets at midnight and you can do it all over again.  My kids loved it so much that we went 2 nights in a row.  It saved me on dinner both nights since it came with food.  \\n\\nThe pizza was pretty good, cheese was gooey and the crust wasn't soggy.

I have had my AC and brakes repaired, in addition to regular maintenance.In both the cases involving repairs, both John and Shane went above and beyond their scope of work without adding to the bill; Why? Because it was important to them to make sure everything was perfect. I recently took my car in without an appointment because  due to the engine light coming on. John did the diagnosis, found the only thing causing the warning light was a very minor issue that he easily fixed..charge? Nothing His only reply to my question as to payment was \\\"It took me 3 minutes, no need.\\\" Although Cathedral is not in my immediate neighborhood I will always take my car there for repairs and regular maintenance.

Well when the food came I noticed that my chicken looked a little weird. As I cut into the chicken it didn't cut like normal chicken. I took a bit & it tasted spongy; the texture and taste were really gross. So I asked my husband about his chicken & he said it was also weird. Needless to say we both could not eat it. Now we have been to this chilies before & we always get some kind of chicken dish and we have never had this problem. I asked the server if they changed their chicken & she said no.

        "Review: I so wish I would have read Yelp before taking my dog here. They are horrible !!!  I called when my dog landed wrong on her leg and was limping. When I called I was quoted 66.58 for the exam and 114.00 if xrays were needed. The tech was awful. It appeared as though she has no idea what she was  doing. The doctor examined her pulled extremely hard on her shoulder to get her to yelp. He said she needed xrays. The tech said it was going to be 215.00. I explained to her that I was quoted differently , but they would not honor the quote. It took over 25 minuets to take them. The doctor came in and told me( with props) that he screened her for valley fever by looking at her bones. I did not bring her in for screenings . I took her there for a potential injury. Had I been told that he was doing the xray for another reason, I would have not said yes. He went on to try to sell me everything from 400.00 tests ( insisting that many dogs in Arizona get valley fever and need to be screened) to counseling because my dog is overweight and I need to be trained on how to feed her. So insulting !!!! He said he was giving me medication. He did not ask if I wanted it , nor did he tell me it was over 50.00. It turned out to be pain medication she did not need, nor did I use it.  The only pain she was in at the office is when he pulled on her until she was in discomfort.  They have no interest in the well being of an animal , just the well being of their cash register. I intend to follow up with a complaint to the BBB. I hope to recoup some of my money for charges( xrays) that were not necessary for her diagnosis. Shame on them for feeding off a pet owner's concern to make a buck !!!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Probably the very same week.  \\n\\nWell... that was a mistake.  I sat at the same bar.  Ordered the same food.  The sushi chef was different though. Every piece of Nigiri I ate made me tear up.  I'm not always a complainer (vocally) so I didn't say anything and just assumed the chef was new and learning the ropes.  Well, the next day my stomach told me otherwise. I now realize the chef was hiding bad fish with massive amounts of wasabi. \\n\\nI never went back, nor will I.  Also, I eat a ton of sushi.  I'm surprised I don't have mercury poisoning.  I say that to point out that my stomach never gets upset from even decent sushi. \\n\\nThe second star is because it's a game of russian roulette here.  You might get lucky.

        "Review text:\nRed Robin is one of those places that takes me back to my childhood. Growing up in the Seattle area, it was one of those fun places that we always went for birthdays or just special nights out. It was a real treat to go to the original location and when I turned 21, my girlfriends and I found ourselves sitting out on the Seattle waterfront far too often.\\n\\nFast forward to 2013...when did this place get so freaking expensive?! I'm not sure why I am surprised, but I am. Just like every other mediocre chain restaurant, prices go up, service and quality go down. I'm left with serious eating remorse and I'm kicking myself for dropping $45 on a meal last night that could have been spent in one of our far superior local establishments.\\n\\nI have been getting the Bleu Ribbon Burger since it was introduced to the menu years ago, but last night I didn't feel like spending $10.79 on one burger so I went with the Patty Melt. It was good enough, and I was pleased. I do love the Red Robin fries and I'm a sucker for their honey mustard. I finished my basket of food and I was actually pretty full. Maybe I didn't need that big burger after all.\\n\\nMy husband had the Veggie Burger. Kids had the Pizza and the Mac and Cheese. No complaints.\\n\\nOur waitress was nice and fairly attentive. It wasn't busy and we were seated right away. Drinks took longer than usual to come out but that's because our waitress dropped my husband's beer. No big deal, accidents happen. I had a good view of the kitchen and watched one worker stand around and play on his phone for a good chunk of time we were there. (Employees on their cell phones while working really irks me). We were seated under the air conditioning so it was really cold. (Someone once told me that keeping a restaurant really cold was a way to move people out quicker. Not sure if that's what they were going for, but it's always on my radar now.)\\n\\nI'd like to say that I have learned my lesson, but I'm sure I will be back because my memories of the past always seem to win.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I am being a little generous when I am giving this \\\"palace\\\" three stars.\\n\\nThe selection is quite basic: saag, tandoori chicken, a dal curry, chicken masala, and some other options which probably aren't worth mentioning.

(Was on a different order) It didnt ring up as the evic special but i didnt notice until after i left. So i went to customer service two days later thinking they would just give me the $1 difference. But no. That would actually be good customer service. Unfortunately the small print of the evic says you can only use the pricing for one order. The rep insisted on pointing it out to me. Now I have to drive all the way back with the item so that I can return the item. What she should have said is that I'll give you it this time but in the future, it has to be one order. I mean i literally shop there every single week for all my groceries. \\n\\nSo i call their customer service line because I am so annoyed that she couldnt just give me the $1 off as advertised that I call the customer service hotline. The employee there wasn't more helpful. \\\"So you are calling because you miss read an email\\\"  So I asked to speak to a supervisor and was put on hold for over 17 mins before it disconnected for some reason or I was hung up on. \\n\\nWell now I'll be searching yelp for a new store to shop.

I feel that maybe showcasing some specialty cheeses in a dish or two, having a more seasonal menu, etc would totally improve the experience. \\n\\nThe \\\"stuff\\\" they sell is also a bit unrelated, a bit more sophisticated than a Spencer's or perhaps Urban Outfitter's table of funny junk and coffee table stuff. I half-expect to see a bobble-head Jesus next time I go in. Everything plays to a niche. It seems theirs is yuppie parents who revel in the novel aspect of wooden toys from France, and paying full-price for hardcover books for their toddlers.  \\n\\nI was excited about the Honeysuckle soap they had out the first few times I went in, but I falsely assumed they restocked stuff like that, thus missed out. It was actually the only reason I dragged my friend in the last time. At 10+ dollars, perhaps it was a blessing that it really is nothing like a grocer at all.\\n\\nMy friend also pointed out that the breads would be really interesting/a possible future purchase if they were not stored in open air baskets next to the food pickup area.\n\nReview rating:",

Joe, originally from Philadelphia, opened the restaurant thirty-three years ago in this exact spot in a strip mall on Granite Reef, just south of McDonald in Scottsdale. Denise started working with him twenty some years ago. They instantly know if you're part of the \\\"family\\\" or a newbie. If you're curious about an item on the menu, you're given a taste. Most of the things are made in house. Joe cooks 70 pounds of chicken breast a week for his famous chicken salad. Mom makes the meatballs, and Denise the cannoli filling. I could go on, but you get the idea. These are genuinely nice people who care about their product and want to please the customer. Joe gets in every morning at 7:30 (although service doesn't start until  11 AM) and stays right through closing at 6 PM. He likes to know what's going on. Saturday closing is at 3 PM so everybody can spend time with their families. And there's a lengthy Christmas break for the same reason. Very nice.\\n\\n     Naturally, Philadelphia Steak Sandwiches ($6.60 - $7.20) appear on the menu. Joe's isn't your typical greasy, cheese whiz loaded, meat too-tough-to-chew sandwich (which, I admit, often appeals to me): here the meat is meltingly tender, sauced with a little marinara, and topped with provolone, served on an outstanding roll made by a local family baker.\\n\\n     We had to try the chicken salad sandwich ($3.70 fir a half, $7.20 full size) - we knew it would be fresh since Joe cooks up a batch most mornings.

        "Very disappointed with the services performed by both the hygienist and dentist. Although the office staff is personable, I had the worst, minimalistic dental cleaning of my life. (My oral-B electric toothbrush does a better job!)  I was also told that instead of repairing the beginning of a loose filling in an otherwise very healthy tooth, they wanted to drill down my natural tooth and replace it with a crown.  Destroying a living tooth is not my idea of preventive dentistry!  My husband also said he would never go back because of the skimpy dental cleaning he received and overall dissatisfaction with their \\\"expertise.\\\"  Don't get me wrong, I'm very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a healthy mouth, but when policy and better judgment err against saving a natural tooth for the potential financial gain of the practitioner (costs associated with the crown), I look for another, more confident and trained dentist.  No wonder their office is dead!  There used to be a time when dentists were skillfully taught a trade and profession; anymore, they are financially driven like common mechanics that want to replace natural living parts too quickly with breakable, man-made replacements.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: Should be advertised as: ALL-WE-WILL-MAKE-YOU-EAT.\\n\\nYes, I eat a lot of sushi. Yes, the sushi here is good. Yes, it is all-you-can-eat for $21.95... For that, you would think there would be more stars, BUT READ THE FINE PRINT... \\n\\nYOU GET CHARGED FOR WHAT YOU DON'T EAT, INCLUDING THE EXTRA BITS OF RICE LEFT BEHIND.\\n\\nI can understand that if you order like 8 rolls and leave several pieces from each, it's a waste, but that was NOT the case for us. Out of the 4 of us, 3 (myself included) ordered all-you-can-eat, so they were already getting a decent amount of $ from us. What we didn't appreciate is that EVERY TIME the guy came to our table he would warn us that we HAD to finish EVERYTHING. \\\"We charge extra for leftovers,\\\" or, \\\"We charge extra for uneaten rice,\\\" or, \\\"I told you we charge extra, right?\\\" \\n\\nThe worst part was, if he wasn't at our table warning us, he never stopped staring at us. He would stand at his podium and WATCH us eat. Then he'd go back to his sushi chef and make comments in Japanese. Specifically, he kept his eyes on me and it made me lose my appetite. He seriously made us feel like we were trying to pull some scam; it was ridiculous. Who wants to be stared down and made to feel uncomfortable while they're trying to eat? I've been a server and bartender for 5 years, and I NEVER treated any of my customers (even the deserving ones) the way the server there treated me. \\n\\nI'm a laid-back person and I'm generous with my reviews, but this was, by far, my WORST sushi experience. I will not be back.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Well today they used some frozen Vienna beef that was like rubber, taste was not nearly the same and the color was off.  This made me sad since I've been a long time customer.  This isn't the first example of them cheapening out.  I guess I will have to go through the trouble of making my own Italian beef and will have to find a good jar giardiniera.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

My visit was  all of about 3 minutes where the doctor took a look and said that i might want to consider surgery. I opted not to do the surgery, and then got a bill for $744.00, of course my insurance paid half but i was on the hook for the rest. I called in and tried to qualify why i would have to pay for a simple consultation, the ladies at billing were matter of fact about what I had owed. $740.00 for a simple consultaion that took 2 minutes.\\n\\nI would make sure that you know what they are going to charge you before going into their office.

        "Quiet Storm is, perhaps, the most expensive vegetarian diner I have ever been to, even by big city standards! Cash-only makes this even more difficult. Tofu wings appetizer was simply not very good; and I usually love these things! I tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment. As far as I know, gyros are supposed to be pretty meaty, but this was mostly lettuce with sporadic chunks of seitan and cucumber,along  with dreaded diced unripe tomato. The wrap was dry and upon looking at the menu again, I see that the sauce that it probably requires costs an extra $.50. The tortilla itself was very white and seemingly unnatural compared to those found at most veggie establishments. My beverage was good and affordable--ginger lemonade. It was sweet for my tastes, but I am sure most people would have thought it perfect. I'll keep Quiet Storm in mind as a coffee shop, only.\\n\\nF.Y.I after splitting the cost of the appetizer with a friend, my lunch cost me $17--ouch! I did have half of the wrap leftover and ate it later as a salad with my own dressing. It was quite good that way and I might recommend that QS rethink the Gyro presentation if they want to continue using so much lettuce.\nSo I would like to give it",

Its very old looking on the inside and the carpets are a little trashed. \\n\\nAs far as shoes, lanes and balls... They have a good variety and the shoes always seem in good condition, I havent had that dreadful pair that you get and are actually scared to carry to your assigned lane......yet. \\n\\nI really like the lady bartenders here. Its practically tradition to get a pitcher of beer for our bowling cause I SWEAR I bowl better when I'm tipsy. They ladies are always very talkative and offer different shot deals too!

        "I was a little disappointed in the bbq; it was a little dry on my visit. The hot links were delicious, but a little too spicy. Regular smoked sausage would be a VERY welcome option for those of us who would not like to burn off their tastebuds but enjoy a good porky item. The bbq sauce is very good, but could benefit with a touch more sweetness and less pepper flakes.\\n\\nGenerally I love spicy food, but too spicy can be distracting and can sometimes send you to the bathroom repeatedly for a few days! Lol\\n\\nNow, the good stuff. Mac and cheese can be heavenly, but the quality has been inconsistent over many visits. Some days, it is considerably less creamy and fresh than others. When its done right, I could make a meal of it. \\n\\nThe potato salad is tangy, delicious, and the sides are a substantial, which is appreciated. \\n\\nI was sad to see they took off the delectable little corn muffins they had briefly on the menu :( good cornbread can be hard to find.\\n\\nBe careful not to back over other patrons in the parking lot!

        "Review: At least on Saturday night, this is a high end dormitory.  Including that the 2am hollerin' and hootin' in halls is transmitted directly into your room.\\n\\nThis is probably the perfect place to land when you load up your sisters and head up from UVW for a weekend of partying in the big city.  The South Side night life (bleh) is right there.  It is great that young folks are finding ways to avoid driving while hammered, so I'll give the hotel that.\\n\\nBut, if you land here from Hotwire, after choosing a 'downtown' hotel, and coming to Pittsburgh with your family, you probably should try to get your money back.  When we checked in, we were put in a 3rd floor room - but when the staff saw I had a 5 y.o. in tow, he volunteered to put us on the top (6th) floor to get us away from the noise.  Apparently, the 6th floor is the quiet floor where they stick the non college crowd.\\n\\nBut, not so quiet.  Once the bars close at 2am, the place was loud, as the after hours parties began on our floor.  Noise in in the hall was pretty crazy at times, and seemed to be from different groups, not a single source.  We were all woken up a few times, and I'm not a light sleeper.  We were street side, and there was also a lot of noisy honking from the street.    All three of us were awake.   Ask for a back (south) side room.\\n\\nThe staff were courteous, the place was clean (except the Magnum box my daughter found when we pulled out the sofa bed), the rooms were pretty spacious.  Hence, 2, not 1, star.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

We arrived early as they are first come first serve even on Holidays.  We started out with two beers and an order of potato wedges. The bacon and cheese covered dish was delicious and I'd get it again (without tomatoes).

We did not have any dessert this time, so can't comment on that. Our server was very nice and had a to-go box waiting for me before I had to ask.

First off, it's been there since before I was born, so that's usually a good sign.  The building and sign has character, and I like that. The interior was classic, booths and counter/bar seating.  I sat down , the bartender was friendly and attentive. I order the Dixie chicken sandwich, fried (not grilled).  In an attempt to be healthy I ordered the broccoli salad.  The sandwich came, and it was awesome. Clearly not a pre made chicken patty. This was obviously hand battered in house.  My healthy broccoli salad?  Well it was more like broccoli slaw without the cabbage.  Full of mayo, but still delicious and not as bad as the house made chips.  \\nI was beyond delighted to eat lunch here.  They have a full bar, but I was not able to indulge as I was still working.  Everything was clean (even the bathroom), the service was good and the food was delicious.

The whole frozen custard concept is new to me, and like most good food, it has not caught on in Canada.  After having lunch at nearby viva las arepas, we walked over for dessert.  There is an enormous sign displaying the many flavours that they make, but wait, don't get too excited, only a few flavours are available daily.  I chose the butter pecan, i am a big cookies and cream fan, so this wouldn't be my first flavour choice, but i was optimistic.  I have known frozen custard to be dense, and rich.  When i put my spoon into the custard, i was quite shocked at how soft, verging on melted, that it was.  I loved how the pecans were toasted, it added so much to the pretty neutral tasting custard.  Plus the little hint of salt was awesome.  \\nOverall, i liked the custard, loved the flavour, but wasn't a fan of the texture.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Your mayo is delectable, your cheese, delish.. and lets not talk about the veggies, mkay?  And your bread... oh the bread!  Lets take a moment of silence!  ...................................\\n\\nOk.  Unfortunately, LA does not have one (which makes no sense, as subway, Quiznos and every other sub place out there is sub-par at best) so I have to deal with the 4 1/2 drive to Vegas to delight in your goodness.  But its worth it ('specially cause I buy 3 and take em home!)  Please move to LA soon cause I dont know how I am making it without you.\\n\\nLove always,\\n\\nW\nSo I would like to give it",

        "My wife stopped in and grabbed some takeout, not sure how much she looked at what they posted on their menu?  It was actually really good sushi, then I looked at the bill.  There was a 15% \\\"Sushi Tax\\\". I called to see if they informed people they were adding 15%, that was a tip for the sushi chef, not the server, and she said it was posted.  I may be wrong, but I thought you were supposed to also tell people verbally that money was added to the bill.  Regardless, I was told it's posted all over the place and they have different levels (5% if sitting at sushi bar).  \\n\\nI find this to be a little under-handed and I'm disappointed as I enjoyed the sushi, best we've had since moving to the area.  We won't go back when restaurants aren't 100% up front about what they add on the bill.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Neck rest broke while getting the massage...nobodies fault, didn't make for comfortable rest of massage though. \\n\\nAs for the hotel....service is slooowwww.  Rang the front desk and an average 15 rings before someone unapologetically picked up. One time 30 rings and another no one picked up.  The excuse was they were booked solid.  So!  Staff for it! Rooms were ok.  I'm a platinum Marriott member, I've been to a ton of hotels (travel for work) and many of them were Marriott resorts.  This one gets last place.  Even the house keeping was slow, we didn't get our room turned until 3pm.  Room service was good.  The only reason they received two stars from me,\n\nReview rating:",

The pies look incredible (I admit I haven't had one yet), but that lemon merengue one is calling my name for my next visit.  Those cinnamon rolls look like they are to die for as well... I love that the bar has popcorn (my fave).  There are plenty of characters working and visiting too, which makes for great people-watching.  \\n\\nEven with all of the above, the selection of other snacks is a bit lacking.  There is a very limited selection of soda and non-draft drinks, and not much as far as savory snacks go.  (I'd suggest nuts or chips or crackers).\\n\\nAnother reason this is a great pit stop? They've got decent restrooms!  Oh, and there is an adorable little farmers market with some fun local products that shares a parking lot with this place as well.\\n\\nAgain, if you're looking for a fun place to stop on your roadtrip, or even if you want to make a trip solely for pies, this place is worth it.

I have purchased necklaces, rings etc...\\n\\nI'm not sure why we couldn't just turn in the ring, get the value of it and put that towards a nicer ring. \\n\\nBecause of this, we will not shop at Kay Jewelers anymore.

        "After everywhere else closes at 2am, this place certainly livens up as it seems half of uptown ends up here. You pay a cover to get in the door which also nets you a free breakfast. The breakfast is pretty good, i stacked my plate with a cooked to order western omelet, grits, bacon, and gravy and biscuits. Very tasty and a huge breakfast. The girls are all very attractive, yet some of them seem a little unenthusiastic compared to other clubs I've been to. The Men's Club does have a couple advantages in my opinion to Uptown Cabaret though. It's larger and much easier to get a table, and feels more upscale. I just don't feel as dirty as I do in other strip clubs. There's a bathroom attendant, a well stocked bar, and a wine room. If you have a few stacks to drop I believe you could have a pretty great night. Long story short, skip IHOP or the Waffle House for your Friday night munchies and come here for dinner and a show.\nSo I would like to give it",

They were very friendly people and I'll be back I'm sure sometime this holiday season. \\n\\nOriginal review: So I saw the sign that said \\\"$16.89 spa pedicure\\\" and I knew there was a catch.

The massage was so fast that I almost started laughing because of how quickly she was running her hands on my feet and legs.... But it's really not bad if you're cheap like I am haha.

The service is nice and never let my drink get to empty, and it was $11 for a really filling meal and soda, tip extra.\\n\\nI am pretty sure 10 out of 10 on the heat here, due to it being pretty authentic local Thai, means the curry would burn through you like thermite through a steel plate.

I got a facial there once, which was relaxing but I've had better.  I didn't know an arm massage was included though, so that was a nice surprise.  I've also gotten my eye brows waxed there a few times, by Colleen, and she does a great job.  Getting my brows waxed by her was actually relaxing!  I got my hair cut at Cameo for awhile, until my stylist moved away.

The service was slow even though the restaurant was nearly empty. The food was luke warm (no surprise sitting under the warmers), pancakes were crusty on top (no surprise sitting under the warmers), waitress never refilled drinks, and we had to ask for the bill. Overall disappointing experience. I'll be happy to get back my favorite Denny's in San Jose, CA.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I've been to this airport at least 8 times over the past 2 years.  It's a pretty decent airport......has decent food, bars and most importantly FREE Wifi for internet access.\\n\\nAnother reason I enjoy this airport is the easy pickup/drop off system for rental cars.  All you have to do is take one shuttle for all rental car companies, which takes you a couple of miles away to a central rental car location.  It's very easy and you don't have to deal with the airport pickup/drop off passenger traffic.  Very convenient.\\n\\nOverall, it's a decent airport and the FREE Wifi is what makes it 4 Stars in my book.\\n\\nWill I return?

        "Review text:\nI've been to John's a couple times before but am just now writing a review after today's breakfast. I dined by myself and was told to sit at any table I would like, which I already knew was the protocol. However, I had not sat down because every single open table was dirty. I waited for a waitress (who was super sweet) to clean the table off and I then sat down to order. \\n\\nAfter ordering, it dawned on me that they don't accept credit/debit cards even though it is 2013. I mean COME ON. I then had to walk down the block to the Wells Fargo ATM to take out cash just so I could eat the food that I had already ordered. Had I initially remembered this inconvenience before parking, I probably would have kept driving by. I do believe that the prices are very affordable here. My breakfast was about $6 and a soda was an extra $2 so it wasn't bad. BUT my soda was a small 12 oz glass bottle and, of course, came with no refills, so I cherished what I had in that tiny bottle. \\n\\nThe food was very good but it was pretty disappointing that I had to wait more than 20 minutes for it. As I said, I was dining alone and the restaurant wasn't too busy. I noticed there was only one person cooking for the 20 or so people in the restaurant at the time. \\n\\nAll in all I ended up paying $15 or so after tip and my $3 ATM fee. For that price, I'd rather go somewhere else that serves a larger brunch portion or offers more variety on the menu. I do love me a good country diner but today's visit left me feeling a little less satisfied.\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nCompletely in love with this place! \\n\\nGreat location in downtown Gilbert - the parking that is very close to the restaurant is a bit limited but there is a large lot about a block away. \\n\\nThe restaurant feels vintagey and was a foodmarket years ago, so it is maintaining that feel but providing a modern/industrial look. I don't love the tables and chairs, definitely not the most plush but serviceable.\\n\\nThere is a counter - complete with a bakery case - where you place your order, When it is busy you have to wait in line and are assigned a table - during slower times you just sit wherever you'd like. \\n\\nThe staff are all really nice and helpful.\\n\\nThe food is delicious. It is a bit expensive for a fairly casual place, but the quality makes it worthwhile. My favorite meal is breakfast - the demi breakfast, pancakes, and bakery items are all amazing, especially the blueberry scone! I always think of scones as being dry and not very flavorful, but theirs are exactly the opposite: moist and tasy, served with a ramekin of whipped sweetened cream. My husband and I always split one with our breakfast. \\n\\nDinner is great, too - my \\\"go to\\\" is the Flatiron Steak with Mr. Pibb Marinade and Fresh Veggies, super good and a perfect portion ($19) Don't leave without dessert! The Red Velvet Cake or Ice Cream Sandwich are perfect to share (the ice cream sandwich is made with two big chocolate chip cookies and vanilla icecream, cut into quarters) If you're too full, get a Salt River Bar to go (Salty and Sweet gets me every time) \\n\\nThey have some cool local beers. mimosas for brunch, and good coffee - their Peppermint Mocha (which is a seasonal Christmas drink) is my favorite.\\n\\nWeird note: Don't miss the bathrooms - each bathroom has a different theme with decorations and a specialized soundtrack (farm, recipes, Tuscany). Very fun.\n\nReview rating:",

I also had the cheddar and broccoli soup which is creamy and not over-doing it like I have experienced time and again with that flavor of soup. I don't usually drink  a lot of soda, but when I do, ice is super important and they have this slushed ice that makes the soda so worth the extra calorie and sugar intake!

My Sister, her daughters and one beau, and myself had a wait of over an half hour before our Dinner... and as we left, there were MORE people waiting two hours later... and EVERY table in this Olive Garden was filled with a mass of people!\\n\\nI really can't give a negative review to Olive Garden with so many people that are fans. Who am I to say that they're totally lacking in good taste? And while being a fan of Italian Cuisine... the Pasta that Olive Garden serves is not half-bad! If only a quarter of the people that had Dinner tonight ever got wind of Yelp, Olive Garden would be the most reviewed restaurant site on Yelp!\\n\\nOn the menu tonight...\\n\\nDinner Salad (^^) Their standard-fare Dinner Salad with Iceberg Lettuce. Not one positive thing I can say about this...\\n\\nBread Sticks (*****) One of the few positive things about Olive Garden. Soft and Plump, with a Buttery Coating. You don't really have to Butter this Bread! Always liked their Bread Sticks.\\n\\nService (^^) Our waitress seemed very robotic and lifeless. I can see why! If a typical wait-person has responsibility for ten tables at Olive Garden... he/she will be harried all night! The tactic at Olive Garden is to not monitor your drinks that much... that would require too much independent thinking... Just hand over to the customer another glass of Water or Soda or whatever they ordered to drink... no questions asked! Half the table had second drinks that were not touched at all! What a waste!\\n\\nNever-Ending Pasta Bowl (*** 1/2 $9.95) First plate was Linguine with Aioli Garlic Alfredo Sauce.... Not that bad! Pasta cooked just right. Alfredo Sauce a little dry... but passable.\\n\\nRaspberry Lemonade (****) Pretty refreshing, I would say!\\n\\nSecond Serving - Spaghetti with Meat Sauce (** 1/2)  Very plain and lifeless Meat Sauce. Passable... that's about all I can say that's positive. When did Olive Garden decide to place the Pasta and Sauce in a small bowl on the second...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

Once for a lunchtime buffet, which was spectacular, and most recently for a quiet dinner for two.\\n\\nI would give this place five stars if it weren't for the quirky service. As is the case with most establishments in Madison I've noticed lately, the service is often mediocre, inconsistent, or just downright bad. Unfortunately, in this instance, Maharaja was no exception.\\n\\nMy dining partner and I were promptly greeted by a waiter at our table. Being that the menu is quite extensive and wanting plenty of time to pour over it, I indicated my indecision and told our server that we weren't in any rush. He must've taken that to mean to disappear for the next 30 minutes. During that time, my companion and I decided on an appetizer and I had some questions. Feeling like we were stranded on an island, I closed my menu a couple times as a lifeline signal. That didn't work. Frustrated, we finally flagged someone over. I was irritated that I could've spent all those wasted minutes noshing while pondering my meal selection.\\n\\nAfter a bit of a communication issue over the menu, we each put in our individual dinner orders. My companion relayed the drink choice: chardonnay, plus a Coke for him. Seeming confused, the waiter attempted to clarify. I interjected with a chuckle, \\\"well, not in the same glass of course,\\\" referring to the soda and wine. Moments later, the waiter returned with a wine for me and what appeared to be a watery-Coke for him. It was obvious after the first sip: the chardonnay and Coke were indeed combined. Ummmm, did this just happen??!! Again our server remained MIA. Finally he returned with my companion's entree. But not mine. About a third of the way into HIS meal, my dinner finally arrived. Sorry, but that is just not acceptable. There was no apology and no indication of the extended wait time. \\n\\nOur service throughout the meal was spotty, with intervals of more frequent attention and drink refills. It is important to note that we showed up just as they...\nSo I would like to give it",

For these reasons, when I recently bought a condo and I was in need of a washer, dryer, refrigerator and television, the first place I looked was Best Buy. However, I picked the wrong Best Buy to make my purchase. \\n\\nThis review is not about ALL Best Buys. This is about the Best Buy on 20th and Camelback. \\n\\nLike I said, I purchased a washer, dryer and television and the Geek Squad mounting from this Best Buy. \\n\\nThe washer, dryer and TV were to be delivered on a Saturday morning by 10:30 a.m.  I received the call on Friday confirming my delivery. On Saturday at 10 a.m. the delivery truck arrived, but there was one MAIN problem. They only had the dryer. Where were my TV and washer? Good question. Well, the washer was on a truck that apparently \\\"broke down\\\" while coming from California. Best Buy didn't bother calling me to tell me that my washer wouldn't be delivered. The television was a whole other story. The sales associate apparently filled out the form incorrectly, and so the order was cancelled. Was I called about either of these issues? No. It wasn't until I talked to the delivery company and 3 different people at Best Buy to \\\"resolve\\\" the problem. At this point it was too late to have my items delivered on Saturday and because I work, I had to wait another week to have them delivered.\\n\\nBut, this saga isn't over yet. When they messed up my order, they PROMISED me I would have my washer and television delivered by 10:30 a.m. the following Saturday since they messed up my order. I had to be somewhere at 11 so it was impertinent it was delivered before then. They said, not a problem and promised it would be there. \\nI called the Geek Squad on Thursday to confirm that my TV would be installed and delivered Saturday. They confirmed that the Geek Squad would arrive WITH the TV and install it. \\n\\nI then got a call from the delivery truck about my washing machine...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

As far as I was concerned it was an over-hyped, overpriced, chi chi trinket store for people with way too much money to blow on crap they don't need. Oh, and they had some food too, but not nearly as much as they did $19 candy. And who doesn't love $19 candy??\\n\\nNow, all of my previous sentiments are still exactly the same. I still think it is all those things that I did before, but they have at least upped a place in my heart (stomach) due to the best freakin BLT I've ever had. For real. Their Avocado BLT is to die for. Glorious slice of bacon stacked on top of glorious slice of bacon on top of more and more bacon. For miles. And goooood bacon. Fresh avocados, tomatoes and lettuce as well to boot. Also came with a delicious slice of pineapple on the side which was one of the ripest I've had out here in a while, so kudos to that as well.\\n\\nSo while I don't see myself patroning the establishment on my own terribly often, next time my boss wants to spend an exorbitant amount of money on my lunch again.

Ask for extra eggplant, though, because they don't put a lot normally.\nSo I would like to give it",

They were proud of the fact that their greens were rolling 11.5 which is ridiculously fast and it's only because you are putting on dead grass.  Chipping the ball around the greens is impossible because there is no grass, as well as, the fairways.  Won't be back for a long time until I hear that they have grass.

Not sure how that would happen but Ketchum wanted to charge me for a new battery!  I told them no way - i had gotten it at O'Reilly's and they would replace it for free!

Before i took it to Ketchum it was always cold on the lowest fan setting and i was being blasted with hot air (in 110 degree AZ heat).\\n\\nI turned around and took it right back.

        "Review: After a failed attempted autoglass replacement by another company earlier this week, I asked the insurance company about Auto Glass Excellence. A coworker used them recently and received good service and a quick response. Like Bill D., I too have State Farm and it was no problem handling the insurance claim.\\n\\nIn speaking with the representative, I set the appointment up to arrive at my office in the morning. The technician called a few minutes before he arrived and explained the process when I took him to the vehicle. About 45 minutes later he was finished and called to indicate it was ready. Quick, painless and quality installation. My coworker, who used to own an autoglass company, stated the glass used was higher quality than the one used by the dealers and he was impressed with the work. My friend went to a web site showing glass company performance. There were only 6 companies on the list with perfect scores - and AGE was one of the companies. They have a great history and based on the installation today, they continue to provide quality service.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The  chirashi bowl had a few kinds of fish chunks with some vegetables and it was good.  However, the short ribs were dry and had no taste.  It was also cold.

        "First, let me state that I never actually received a ride from this company. I've tried on two separate occasions, but their dispatch team has never allowed me to get that far and has MAJOR customer service issues. The only reason I've ever called this company is because their phone number is so easy to remember.\\n\\nOn my most recent call to the company (which just happened to be last night), I had to call from a pay phone because my cell phone battery died. Someone answered about 6 rings later and mumbled \\\"hello,\\\" no mention of the company or even the employee's name. \\n\\nI asked for a ride home from the Phoenix Public Library over on Central and McDowell, and the dispatcher asked for the address. I told him I don't know the address and he told me to \\\"ask someone for it.\\\" I explained that I can't just walk around asking for the address because I'm on a payphone and there is no one within 30 feet of me. So he responded, \\\"Oh, well, I need an address to get a cab to you.\\\" I ended up looking through a stack of torn up phone books searching for the address while he held a conversation with one of his co-workers. None of them listed the library address and the dispatcher hung up on me after a minute.\\n\\nI called another cab company immediately afterwards and had absolutely no problem with them. The dispatcher didn't ask for the library's address (in fact, she stated it just after I told her where I was) and didn't hold a conversation with co-workers about weekend exploits. Never calling Yellow Cab again.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "My introduction to Japanese cooking occurred years ago in Norwalk, Calif. It had been a grueling day and I wanted to get away, so I hopped in the car and started driving until I saw a storefront with a line out the door. After waiting for about 15 minutes I pointed to the picture on the wall. Having no idea what it was, I had ordered Tempura Udon.\\n\\nI dunked one of the thick shaggy pieces of shrimp into the savory broth and watched as the tempura quickly soaked up the broth. The flavors were ethereal.\\n\\nMy initial slurp of thick slippery udon is among the great food experiences I've ever had. Unfortunately, I've never had udon that has compared to that first steaming bowl.\\n\\nAfter driving by Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe in Phoenix many times, I finally stopped in. They excel at their namesake with tasty noodles and more offerings than you can shake a wet noodle at.\\n\\nIt's a calming space with a quick, friendly wait staff and a menu that's mostly Asian inspired. There's a section dedicated to Italy, though I'm not sure how much curry and ginger Italians use in their pasta.\\n\\nCherry Blossom also offers many salads, including Tokyo Chicken Coleslaw ($7.60). It's essentially a Chinese chicken salad with grilled chicken, cabbage, lettuce and daikon sprouts in a tangy vinaigrette dressing. It's deliciously light and refreshing.\\n\\nA friend once told me that the spiciness of a spicy sushi roll was invented to help disguise the flavor of fish that might not be so fresh. While I'm not saying that the Spicy Salmon Roll ($5.60) wasn't freshly made, it was so fishy that it was inedible. Spicy as it was, it couldn't disguise the flavor that remained with me after the first try.\\n\\nThe California Roll ($4.40) fared better, but then again it was just a California Roll, imitation crab, cucumber and avocado wrapped in rice.\\n\\nMoving right into noodles, the egg version used in the Korean Spicy Beef ($10.50) were so chewy and fun to eat, I only wished the bowl was larger. Spiked with green peppers and tender sliced of beef,...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

But the DQ I grew up in was an eat-in, sit down sorta place that served all your regular frozen treats and footlongs/hotdogs, etc. But that DQ also sold hamburgers and Country Baskets (breaded sticks of steak that you dunked in a bucket of gelatinous white gravy, DELICIOUS) and other plates not found in normal DQ menus. I know that this isn't your typical DQ and but I'd never been to a throwback DQ like the one in Plaza-Midwood.\\n\\nEverything was ok. Just ok. At first Becky and I were a bit confused as to where to order since there were people scattered throughout the windows in no discernible order.

So neither really noticed us when we stood there for a good five minutes trying to figure out where to order.\\n\\nFinally, we just approached a random window and the guy came over. He was very nice, attentive and polite. He took our order and verified everything twice.\\n\\nThe girl, on the other hand, was kinda... unpleasant. Not that she was overly rude or anything. She would just randomly stick her hand out of the window with a product someone had ordered without any real expression on her face. As the guy was still taking our order, the girl stuck out her hand with a hand-dipped cone and said, \\\"hand-dipped cone\\\". I was standing right next to her and just kinda looked perplexed for a second not sure who she was talking to. I asked if it was ours and she just looked at me without saying anything. I confirmed with Becky that she'd order one. I looked back at the girl and asked, again, if it was ours as no one else was approaching the window to pick it up. She looked at me and, what  I perceived as almost, rudely, said, \\\"it's a hand-dipped cone...\\\" That didn't sit well with me at all. I grabbed it and thanked her.

Every single time maintenance has come to fix something, workers have left a huge mess. There is always some kind of \\\"renovation\\\" going on here, which is extremely inconvenient to residents. In the 2 bedroom/2 bath apt, the master bedroom has a shower w/ tub but the other bathroom simply has a tiny shower very annoying. Whatever you do, do not move into these apartments.

        "Double whammy on this guy. Another Hampton for my Hilton properties list, and unfortunately, I have to add my favorite old faithful hotel chain to the Improper Bathroom Ventilation list. \\n\\nThe hotel is a Hampton, and all that entails. Good breakfast, my favorite hotel beds, serviceable rooms, etc. In the case of this Hampton, the lobby looks to have refreshed recently, but the rooms are a bit old. My room was a little odd, in that it might have been a two bed room, and is now a King - the only decent outlets were under the desk (so one of those lamps with the outlet built in would be nice) or behind the couch - there wasn't even one behind the nightstand. So that was kind of weird. \\n\\nI had the same carefully folded/fanned shower curtain as others, but alas, no bathroom ventilation. It didn't fog up too bad, but I have to add it to the list - no favoritism for the Hampton crowd. As others have commented, shower pressure could have been better, but wasn't bad. \\n\\nI do appreciate when Hamptons try to differentiate a little - corporate must give the franchisees a little leeway - this particular one was putting out Arnold Palmer supplies and cookies in the lobby for the afternoon check in crowd. I am an idiot, and it didn't dawn on me what was going on, so I just had some lemonade. Curses. \\n\\nTo sum it all up, close to campus? Hilton points? Comfy bed? Free breakfast? A-OK.

        "Got together with a few former coworkers Saturday night early (5:00-ish) to catch up & have an early Christmas celebration.  Since it just so happened none of us had been to MG in a while, we decided this would be our spot (we used to go regularly as a group when we still worked together at a nearby office).  Things have changed.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE:\\nThey still have this going for them.  This is one of the main reasons we used to gather here to begin with.  Still a great place to just kick back in a booth, relax with friends or loved ones, and not worry about having to be too quiet or having to talk over deafening music and patrons.  Noise level is just right, which is greatly appreciated.  Few places are able to balance debauchery and civility so well.\\n\\nSERVICE:\\nWe had a great waitress. She was really on-point, even as the crowds increased, being neither too obtrusive nor inattentive.  One thing I really appreciated was that she attempted to quickly \\\"get to know us\\\" a bit--this helped her help a few of US make decisions when too many things looked yummy or weren't in the mood for anything specific.   Friendly. Prompt. Attentive. Knowledgeable. What more could you ask for?!\\n\\nFOOD:\\nNOT WHAT IT USED TO BE.  Don't get me wrong, it's still palatable; HOWEVER, you can tell the quality has diminished drastically.  I ordered the Mediterranean Olives ($2) in citrus marinade as an appetizer. Must say I really enjoyed those (sodium warning...whew!).  Another ordered the fried calamari appetizer ($9).  This was a disappointment.  While the price was average/reasonable, one expects more than just a few bland, nearly tasteless rings of the stuff.  It was mostly the tentacle ends of the poor lil' squid.  And lots of them.  Odd.  Her lobster ravioli ($18) was yummy according to her (looks a tad skimpy, but said it was quite filling).   My Pasta Milano ($12) was nothing like it used to be.  It's now made with rigatoni instead of bow-tie. In-and-of-itself, that's no big deal, but if you're a 'pasta person' you know how... My rating for this place is",

So they found several problems with it as of course my mileage is 154,000 on that car. They are a bit overcharge for repairs and suggested me to find a newer car. I rejected their offers, and took the car home because I know there are minor repairs and runs great. I dont want another car payment. I took it somewhere else that can fix my car much cheaper and do it right. It is okay... but their prices are too high. About $1,000 worth of repairs that should be run around $300.00.

        "Would I pay the suggested price of $250 a night to stay here? Bahahaha. No.\\n\\nWe booked Omni William Penn via one of those Mystery Deals on Hotwire: they tell you it's a 4-star hotel located downtown, you book it, and you're stuck with the consequence. We got the room for $99 a night, which is reasonable.\\n\\nIt's a grand old building, for certain, but I'm not sure what the fuss is about. As we were unfamiliar with Pittsburgh, there were things we didn't know, such as Downtown being a business district that completely dies after 7 p.m. It's obvious this is a hotel for business people and not tourists because we were left with nothing to do at night. Let's just say I'm completely caught up on the latest season of \\\"Duck Dynasty\\\" and I don't even like men with beards.\\n\\nWhat makes this a four-star hotel? I'm not sure. Our view was other hotel rooms, and they were unoccupied so we couldn't even be entertained with voyeurism. The building is oddly shaped, creating an area where sounds from the busy street below become trapped and wake you up every hour of the night. The entire building is heated, which was awesome when coming in from the snow outside, but made for very hot nights that we were unable to counteract with the a/c unit in the room. The TV was a good 10-15 feet from the bed, which was kind of amusing at first but an annoyance when trying to see the nuances in Food Network cooking competitions.\\n\\nThe perks were a bagel shop, Jimmy John's and Starbucks downstairs in the same building. Given that this hotel does not offer free coffee, free breakfast or free WiFi, prepare to open your wallet if you don't want to spend hours outside wandering around trying to find a place that's open past 5 p.m.\\n\\nLocation: Meh\\nAmenities: Meh\\nBed: Meh\\niPod dock: Seriously, what kind of four-star hotel doesn't provide an iPhone dock?\\n\\nVisiting Pittsburgh for pleasure?

The Lunch Buffet starts at 11:30 and today featured a good selection of 15 items on the Salad Bar plus 5 dressings.  For hot offerings there was a pasta dish with white sauce which was ok after being perked up with some salt & Parmesan Cheese, and 3 large pizzas at a time, each made 1/2 & 1/2 with two different sets of toppings & both regular and thin crust choices.  There was also a dessert pizza and two kinds of bread sticks plus Marinara Sauce for the non-Cinnamon flavored ones.\\n\\nAlso a plus was that they cut the slices narrow (about 2\\\") and that they loaded them up well with toppings.  (See my photo of a slice with Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, tomato, mushrooms, Bell Pepper and olives.)\\n\\nOk, the not-so-good news:\\n\\nI'm a big Cottage Cheese fan, but what they had here, although fresh tasting, wasn't creamy at all.  (\\\"2%\\\"?)  Worse was the taste of the pizza.  As delicious as the slice in the photo (& the rest of the pizzas) looked, the overall taste was B-L-A-H!  The crust tasted like Bisquick or something.  Whatever it is, they should get rid of it STAT & get some real pizza dough!  The cheese tasted totaly bogus, too, to the point that all the pretty toppings couldn't make up for the basic taste.     :-(\\n\\nAll this has to do with what Corporate is sending them to serve.  The restaurant itself was fine, & there were some nice touches such as paper towel rolls, Parmesan Cheese & red chile flakes all provided on each table.  This particular store would have 5-Star potential if the pizzas tasted as good as they looked.  It IS the best Pizza Hut Buffet in the Valley, & there was enough good here, including the reasonable $5.99 price, to earn it 3 Stars.     :-)\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Just a couple of weeks ago we took our 10-month-old kitten ti Saguaro to get tested after he was exhibiting some troubling symptoms - wobbly walking, falling over easily, loss of appetite, staring into space. The vet performed a blood test and our kitten was diagnosed with FIP (feline infectious peritonitis), an incurable, untreatable disease. Dr. Mike talked us through our options and it became clear that our little guy was suffering and was not going to get better. We made the difficult decision to put him to sleep a few days later. The day of, my boyfriend and I were a wreck. As soon as we came in we were led to a private room and the technician laid a soft comfortable blanket down for our kitten to rest on. The vet came in and was so soothing and understanding, giving our boy a full check-up to make sure the diagnosis was correct before putting him down. I was nearly inconsolable and every single person there treated me like family. The nurse at the front gave me the tightest of hugs before we left. And then, just yesterday we received a condolence card in the mail from Saguaro. Honestly - the best veterinary clinic in the world!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "So, I fly a lot., nearly 70,000 miles in the past 6 months. Not usually US Airways/America West - only maybe 5 or 6 times with them. But my ONLY horrible airline experiences have both been with them., which is quite a ratio.\\n\\n1. Flew from San Diego to Portland meeting up for a month-long concert tour. I had  my personal things as well as music/sound equipment. Of course, when I land, my luggage didn't. After spending at least an hour trying to get baggage services to help me - they say my luggage is on the next flight, and they will have a courier deliver it to me. I make abundantly clear that I will meet the courier and have it personally handed to me - I don't want it left with security/staff/anyone else (we were at a large rock venue).  They promised to call as soon as my luggage landed, and again when the courier was en route and they would only deliver to me personally.\\n\\nOf course, no call. And I called every hour on the hour till 4 in the morning (when we left for the next city on the tour) - and couldn't get an answer or a call back. Not only did they not call me as promised, OR return any my calls, they apparently DID deliver my bags, but just left them on the door of the venue - EXACTLY what I had stressed not to do. I found this out the next day after calling repeatedly - when we were already in another city. Nobody signed for them even. Never saw my bags again, lost a ton of important gear I needed for work, and was screwed. And then? A HUGE a huge fight with them over the claim. They dishonored the claim for a while since they said they delivered them to the address I specified - despite having a promise in writing to deliver to me by hand. Then they said my claim was with the courier company, not the airline.Then they didn't want to cover anything but clothing and hygiene items.\\n\\n2. Flew from St. Louis to Flagstaff. Had a layover in Phoenix - which is only like a 2 hour drive from Flagstaff. The flight in Phoenix was delayed several hours - but they didn't announce the delay until 10...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

This time, no different.. 45 min. - 1 hr. wait.. I'm not used to waiting in Vegas?! Seriously?!.. OK, this time we waited.\\n\\nWhat we had at the Bar Counter:\\n\\n21. Chicken Cutlet: deep fried breaded chicken (like Katsu or chicken fried steak). Nice crust and the dark brown dipping sauce brought it Alive! sauce was thick and semi-sweet ilke (Katsu/Teriyaki sauce). Chicken was moist and sliced into finger tenders. Plain Good.\\n\\n62. Kaku - Ni (pork belly w/ egg): small bowl filled with tender and juicy pork in some type of broth/sauce and a half a boiled egg. Full of Pork Goodness!\\n\\n81. Fried Rice - Kimchi: Nice portion, mild balanced flavor of Kimchi, rice was soft, not mushy and went great with all the proteins.\\n\\n*Off the Wall/Paper Menu:\\n\\nSalmon Belly: decent slab of salmon belly fillet with an evident taste of some kind of light vinegar/alcohol flavoring. Came with a tiny mound of super minced radish. Salmon was 'melt in your mouth or on the dish' consistency. It was kind of rich, fatty and Delicious (the radish settled down the richness and fattiness a bit). \\n\\nYellowtail Tar Tar: I usually don't do Raw but this time I made an exception because of all the praising on past reviews. 4 pieces, each piece was a fluffy and crunchy tortilla chips layered with rice, avocado and.. yellowtail on top. I couldn't taste the fish much, I just noticed a slight chewiness. Everything worked Really Well, the texture was Amazing and it was an Awesome Tortialla Chip Sandwich!\\n\\nAtmosphere reminded me of some restaurants in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles (It felt like I was eating somewhere in Japan). No complaints on Service. Value was fair, Japanese portions are hardly ever huge but quality makes up for it. The food was satisfied but nothing really stood out.. I'd come back but I wouldn't wait more than 10 minutes to dine here.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "I went here on Halloween with my boyfriend for a romantic, nice dinner.  We came in at about 6:30 pm and it appeared to be fairly uncrowded with many open tables. We were placed in a back room at a table for two. \\n\\nWe were given a good selection of bread, consisting of a dill bread loaf (I think), a biscuit and a sesame seed covered fresh, soft breadstick, with a big pat of butter. The bread was warm and good. \\n\\nWhen you sit down, you get a glass of ice with fresh vegetables on a stick. I am still a little unclear as to whether it's supposed to be an edgy decoration, meant to symbolize temptation, or whether you can just eat it. We ate it, and it was good. \\n\\nI ordered the key lime gimlet for the drink, which was the color of keylime pie, cold, came in a martini glass and had a graham cracker crust rim, with a fresh lime slice for a garnish. It was really delicious, sweet, creamy and tart.\\n\\nFor an appetizer, we ordered the scallops. They were very delicious. The sauce was rich and tasty. The scallops themselves were cooked well and were served over a bed of mashed potatoes in an actual shell (like from the sea). \\n\\nI ordered the 8 oz filet for my entree. It was a good cut of meat, and had good seasoning on it. It was thick, juicy, and delicious. They served it on a hot metal plate upon a normal plate, and because the plate was still hot, it didn't cool off while I was eating it slowly to savor the taste. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the lamb, and he liked it. I tried it and it was pretty good! He wasn't able to finish it, since it was a lot of food.\\n\\nFor my sides I ordered a mixed greens salad doused in a vinegarette and a baked potato. My boyfriend ordered the asparagus for his side.\\n\\nWe had a good server. We were initially seated in a room where there seemed to be a reservation for a group of 15, right next to the large group...not the best location to place a couple obviously on a romantic date when half the tables in the entire restaurant are empty.

But the flavor is completely lacking and the execution is lazy-- I'm no great chef,  but I can make a much better chicken marsala than theirs and the sausage in my wife's pasta was mushy and clearly intended as a pizza topping.  \\n\\nWhen the waiter came to ask how everything was I gave a very deadpan \\\"Ok,\\\" waiting for him to ask \\\"Just ok?\\\" or something like that.

        "Apparently I'm one of the few who just doesn't think the Grand Concourse is all that \\\"grand.\\\"   I've had brunch here twice and both times I've been underwhelmed.  I've heard people say this is the best brunch in Pittsburgh and I have just one question for them...\\\"have you been to other brunches in town?\\\"  \\n\\nIt's always packed and despite having a reservation, we weren't seated in a timely manner.  To top it off, the service was terrible.  It wasn't until half way through brunch, that the waiter returned and we were able to ask him AGAIN for water.  Considering I'd run 15 miles earlier that morning and had asked for water the minute we were seated, I was a little frustrated.  It also took us forever to get tea and coffee.  I actually thought he forgot my tea because it took over 15 minutes from when we finished eating and ordered it to when we received it.  \\n\\nAnd, oh the food.  There might be a lot of it, but it's not the great.  It tastes like a buffet to me.  Not as fresh or as flavorful as I would like.  Yes, they have their own omelet bar (not that the cheese in my omelet was melted or my fillings were hot) and their own waffle bar with more toppings than I could possibly want (luke warm waffles at best under the heat lamp), but I think they overwhelm you with quantity rather than quality.  \\n\\nAlso, I like a little mimosa with my brunch.  And what I don't like here is that it isn't included in the base price (which they fail to tell you).  If I'm going to pay $25 or so dollars for brunch, you could at least throw in one mimosa.  Lidia's does....Point Brugge does...All in all, I spent $35.49 for Sunday brunch for ONE (brunch, mimosa, tip) and I left disappointed and unsatisfied.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the atmosphere is very classic and beautiful!

        "This was our second visit to Olive or Twist.  We came over this past summer for food and cocktails, but this last visit was just for the booze to have a celebratory drink with Laura M on her Birthday after seeing a great Ballet at the Benedum.  \\nI don't mind O&T layout.  It's a bit chopped up but very Pittsburghese reminiscent of most establishments.  There is the upstairs where you can sit by the roaring fire on the 72\\\" flat screen or lounge on many of the couches or loveseats they have available.  There is also the downstairs that seems to have similar offerings, however at least in our experiences was a lot busier than upstairs.  I pick less busy almost every time. This time around we found three bar seats available upstairs and settled down for a couple drinks.  \\nI started with a Southern Tier XXX IPA, solid start to the evening.  I know they specialize in Martinis but I specialize in craft beer.  After that I decided to try a martini, I went with an Espresso Manhattan Martini.  This was defreakinlishious... I love coffee and I love manhattans so the two went together like peas and carrots.  Our service was mixed.  Some bartenders seemed more helpful and interested in waiting on us than others.  This was also my experience from last time.  This time we didn't order food though we were pretty hungry and went elsewhere to eat.  Our last meal here was not worth duplicating.  We both had an Olive or Twist Burger, and I chose sweet potato fries and requested a med rare cook.  We used the Yelp deal so it wasn't as expensive as it could have been, but the burger sells for $13.00.  I rarely complain about cost especially if it is good, however it really was not.  The meat was way overcooked and dry.  Surprisingly the fries were the best thing on the plate.  To spend that on a burger I do expect a better quality.  So lesson learned, we had some tasty drinks here last weekend, but ate at a neighboring facility afterwards.  I'm sure we will be back for drinks again.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

The rooms they put us in were in the \\\"Courtyard\\\" area in the back of the hotel.\\n\\nThis was, bar none, one of the absolute worst dumps I have had the pleasure of staying at, anywhere in Las Vegas.  I was coming from Harrah's, and was very disgusted when I saw this place.\\n\\nThe \\\"Courtyard\\\" rooms are nothing more than a modified \\\"Motel 6\\\" or \\\"Super 8\\\" type buildings.  This is a very old structure, which is musty, and is many years old.  It is a two-story building with no elevator; only stairs, so be warned if you have lots of bags.  It was like they took an old Motel, and moved it in back of the Palace Station tower.  It just did not belong there.\\n\\nUpon arrival, both rooms that I had reserved did not have functioning Internet access.  One of the rooms had a very strong \\\"medicine\\\" type odor.  The second room smelled very musty, and like it was a former smokers room.  I had requested non-smoking.

The replacement rooms had working Internet, but were definitely not to the expectations you would find elsewhere in Las Vegas.\\n\\nEven though my reservation was for two nights, the rooms keys for both my rooms were shut off the following day.  My guest and I were locked out of our rooms.  Upon calling the front desk about this problem, their solution was to dispatch their Security guards to make sure we were supposed to be there.  The Palace Station security guards gave us the third degree, and told us we needed to make the long walk back to the front desk to resolve the key problem even though we were not fully ready, or had taken a shower yet.\\n\\nBetween the structure, casino/hotel clientele, and condition of this place, I should have known better.

He then asked me where my car was and I told him that we passed it. He then decided to lecture me about speaking up. I didn't appreciate that since I spoke up three times.

        "I wish I would've read the Yelp reviews prior to booking this hotel, because if I had, I would've stayed elsewhere. This hotel left so much to be desired, sadly. We arrived and went up to our room. Walked in and smelled the musty smell that other Yelpers described. The room was pretty clean but so so worn down for the price per night. See pictures for proof. I mean, a stain on a chair and bed skirt isn't acceptable when you're paying upwards of $300 for two nights. The water pressure was borderline painful and the shower head was very low. The bed was hard as rocks and very uncomfortable. There was an issue with parking as the machines weren't working this past Saturday morning. Finally, I told the guy at the desk I needed to go and to get me out of the deck however he could because I was in a wedding and was late at this point (because of their issue) to meet with the bridal party. Nothing was done to accommodate the crappy situation unfortunately. \\n\\nThis hotel is extremely loud and the walls are very thin. Some gals strolled in at 3am Sunday morning talking about strippers and we were listening to the bumping of Katy Perry's \\\"Roar\\\" remix blasting from the EpiCenter all. night. long!!!!!! See night stands for ear plugs. \\n\\nWord to the wise: steer clear of this dump. Spend your money at a hotel that actually has good customer service and cares about the quality of their hotel.

        "A year ago, when I was training for my first half-marathon, the PF Chang's one, this was my go-to place. Yes, it helped that they live just a 5-minute drive away from me, but everyone was really nice. I never got the sense that anyone was trying to talk me into spending more money. Part of that attitude probably has to do with the fact that they don't get paid for commission. But unlike a Foot Locker or some other mall store, the employees look like they actually run themselves. And they are incredibly patient. I'm bummed that the brand of shoes that works best for me, they don't sell. But they still help me whenever I come in and I buy all my other things from them like socks, Gu, etc. \\n\\nThe people were pretty supportive in trying to give me advice last year when I had very bad shin splints and I wasn't there to buy anything. One salesman adjusted my shoes for me by putting the insoles of my old pair inside for extra cushioning. It seemed to do the trick. It's definitely a place where you are rarely steered wrong.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nThis is a bit of an odd one because the ambiance and decor don't match the food that we had.  We went for Restaurant Week and the $30 prix fixe for 2 ended up at $95 with the addition of 2 beers and a glass of wine, plus tip.  The food was actually very good and the presentation was very good, too.  My steak wasn't high-end steakhouse caliber, yet it was a good piece of meat.  Portions were somewhat modest, but reasonable for a classy meal.  \\n\\nNow for the rest...  The main area, where we sat, has a very high (2-story) ceiling, with plenty of light.  Great, so far.  There is another eating area and a bar that have standard ceiling height.  There are two types of seating.  One is square tables, with white table clothes, and the other is padded benches with outdated mauve tables.  Very Denny-ish or like a local diner.  They benches were in great shape, but the tables were a little worn around the edges.  The table was stocked with a plain salt-and-pepper set and a plain sugar holder.  The floor was carpeted, which I only mention because, unless carpeting looks very clean, I view it as a breeding ground for bacteria.  Not that it was, just worries me.\\n\\nOur main waiter was very good.  Professional and efficient.  The drink waitress seemed more appropriate for a country diner in appearance, demeanor, and dress.  The crowd was on the older side (not that there's anything wrong with that, plus I ain't a youngster), which may have been because of the early time we went.\\n\\nThat's about it.  If the seating area got a makeover, I'd say this place could be called a moderately high-end restaurant.  Then again, if I'd eaten one of the more down home choices, and/or paid just a bit less, it probably would have all come together for me.  I'd go back for a $30-40 meal, but if I'm paying $100, I'll be \\ngoing elsewhere.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

This time I was on vacation and the wife 7 I decided to have lunch at Joe's and we couldn't be happier.  We went around 1 PM. and we got seated right away and our server Tara was awesome.  She recommended a Pina Colada drink served in a whole, cored out frosted pineapple.  This drink was the bomb and if you love Pina Coladas you need to order this.  We started out with a sampler appetizer and a bowl of clam chowder.  I then ordered a Arctic Steam pot and my wife ordered the East Coast Fish platter.  No matter what time of day you come, there food is always fresh and tasty.

The doctor told me my body was just 'catching up' and had no advice to offer me or medication to prescribe. So I continued to be sick for another two weeks. Her only solution was for me to get my blood drawn to see if anything abnormal was revealed. \\n\\nI never received the results of the lab tests, so when I called two weeks later to inquire about them, there was no 'message' on the voice mail for my patient ID. I called the front desk to ask about it, and she said the doctor's assistant would call me back. The next day she left a message saying 'we need to setup a time to go over your lab results.' I called back shortly after, and the assistant was already gone (Thursday afternoon) and wouldn't be back until Monday.  She never called me back, and I called two more times to get some answer and I never received any information or a call back from the 'doctor's assistant.'\\n\\nThe doctor wanted to scheduled a follow-up the next time I was in town, which took place today. After talking to me for 2 minutes, the doctor (a different one from the first time I went) abruptly examined me and then sent her assistant in to tell me I couldn't receive the Depo Provera shot I was scheduled for (a form of birth control taken every three months) and then wouldn't give me any alternate prescription for birth control because she was in a hurry to leave the office. \\n\\nMy dad is a patient there, and instead of receiving the flu shot he was supposed to, they \\\"accidentally\\\" gave him the Gardasil shot, which is one of a series of shots to prevent certain forms of HPV in WOMEN. \\n\\nI will never go back there again, and I strongly advise you not to- unless you want the worse service you can pay for. Huge waste of time and money,...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

It's relaxing to take the dog on a long walk through through. \\n-Did I mention a big ass courtyard? \\n\\nThe Not-so-Good: \\n-Due to the lush landscaping there are a fair number of roaches. Now, they spray and do a great job of it, but expect to pick at least a few dead roaches up each week. I have yet to find a live bug inside. \\n-Parking for residents is kind of tight, and big trucks seem to be strategically placed to make getting around corners difficult (I'm looking at you silver Titan!) \\n-If you're visiting a resident you park on the street. You can request a spot inside the grounds on an as needed basis. \\n\\nThe Bad: \\n-There is an evil ass striped cat that wears a pink collar. Don't be fooled by the collar, this cat is crazed and dogicidal. I've had this tabby terror stalk my enthusiastically stupid dog on more than one occasion.

I have Yelped over 200 places and this is by far the worst cash register employee I have ever encountered. I've seen people who were lazy and not very smart, but no one has been as condescending and impatient as the hag that is taking your order at this restaurant.

        "Hoosier Cafe - I know you've got a ton of regulars and the line is out the door and up the block on the weekends so we stopped in on a Monday morning. Excellent service and friendly waitstaff. Loved our French Toast, no we really really loved our French Toast. The omelette breakfast was good too, but the plain old scrambled eggs were plain old scrambled eggs. My fault. A teeny bit of a problem with the bacon for our skillet breakfast, but what the heck? Everything else was good enough to make a return visit.See ya next time! My rating for this place is",

Lucky for them, because otherwise it would just be mediocre.\\n\\nThe staff is nice enough, but they don't really do much for me otherwise.  I guess that's actually a good thing, what with all the average service we've seen lately - what happened to people actually caring if you were getting good service?\\n\\nAs to the food?  There was a time that I didn't want to set foot in a Chili's, but it's been a long (long) time since I worked there, so I don't mind so much anymore, and the selection is really pretty decent.  We had a good variety.\\n\\nI can never understand why people charge what they do for a plate of macaroni and cheese on the kid's menu (because they can), but apparently it's pretty decent.  I went for the buffalo chicken fajitas, and it was a solid choice, surprisingly.  Not healthy or anything, but not bad.\\n\\nService was speedy, but not overly friendly.

I'm down with the fusion, only if it's done tastefully. I mean, after all, you are there for the taste. \\n\\nSeared tuna... was far from seared. They just let the flimsy slivers of tuna saturate in the acid for a bit to give it a seared look. But uh, it was missing the crisp in the sear, and all I could taste was the acidity and pepper sprinkled on top. \\nTakoyaki... supposedly had some octopus bits in it. Luckily, I found 1/4 of a tentacle in these things. However, this was sabotaged by the sauce these little balls were drowning in. Too much basil in the hoisin or something. \\nThe caterpillar... haha. Cute, but was searching for some significant pieces of eel in here. Sushi rice was a bit soggy too. \\n\\nEbi-ten, basically udon/soba (opted udon) with two shrimp tempura, was okay.

        "Review: The salon is clean and charming and has a great reputation. My first visit was perfect with Yaniss (sp?) for my hair and she is AMAZING. If this was review was based soley on her I would give her 10/5. She listens to her clients, gives expert advice and you walk out happy. \\n\\nMy complaint wasn't until my second visit. In attempts to schedule an appointment with the same stylist for a late Friday or Saturday. Since Yaniss is fabulous she was booked up which I understand but whoever I spoke with told me she might have a cancelation and she would call me back either to inform me of the cancelled appointment or to schedule an appointment for another time. Friday evening rolled around and I hadn't heard back so I called back and now she had no cancelled appointments and no appointments coming up because the girl \\\"must have spaced calling me back.\\\"  I get it - stuff happens. So they squeezed me in and did my hair later the next week and everything was set. \\n\\nOk so flash forward like two weeks - I was entered in to win a set of eyelash extensions and I was so excited to find that I was picked. I scheduled an appointment to redeem the service and then the night before came down with the stomach flu everyone had around the time. Clearly I wasn't going to expect someone to apply eyelashes to me so I called the salon to request them reschedule me and no one answered so I left a message. 15 minutes after the time I was scheduled I received a message from who was scheduled to do my service saying that she wouldn't be able to do my eyelashes that day because I was late.... Clearly no one gave her my message so I texted her back explaining the situation and called the salon and left another message. No one has yet to call me back to this day. \\n\\nIt is discouraging to your clients when you offer such good services but it's so difficult to get scheduled for them. I have a busy schedule and calling over and over to give you my business isn't ideal.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The best thing about it is the people - my neighbors have been very friendly and respectful (with the exception of a few bad seeds, who moved out) and the office staff.  The worst thing is the time it takes for a maintenance request to be completed.  What's also irritating is that they have a contract with a third party internet/cable provider so there is no choice.  I love my apartment, a 1-bedroom with den with vaulted ceilings.  The price is competitive and comparable to other apartments in the area.

It was a very pleasant service experience, friendly and not too stuffy and you could tell they really have a lot of pride for the place.  I actually feel bad about giving them a negative review because they seem like really nice people.  \\n\\nAnd the house is very old and interesting but that's not the definition of four star. Grandma's china and chilled forks and old fashioned service was adequate but certain things just put it off; like the dingy rugs in the bathroom and the shabby landscaping and I don't know what all actually.  Just felt a little amateurish.\\n\\nI did really enjoy the pear salad but the mushroom soup starter was cold and what really loses the stars for me is the mediocre entree of undercooked pork and tough steak.  Really disappointing.  I loved the sweet potato puree that came with it but it was the only flavor on the plate.  And that undercooked pork was inedible and I don't even mind a little pink.  This was raw in the center and mine wasn't the only one.  No one wanted to complain as it was a customer event.  But I would have sent it back if I were on my own.\\n\\nThe desert was your typical banquet style flourless chocolate cake but no coffee was offered.  Which may have been the planners fault but I really could have used some.\\n\\nOverall, a pleasant experience but doesn't live up to the reviews or the price tag.

And my friend got the equivalent of three turkey club sandwiches in their turkey club.  So in terms of quantity of food they have things covered.\\n\\nI'd say my fish sandwich was borderline generic.  The fish wasnt anything special and the batter was so thick it was soft on the inside and almost underdone.  The fish was on top of a normal nondescript roll with a piece of withered warm lettuce.  The fries were very dark in color but surprisingly soft and ok flavored.  \\n\\nThe turkey club was so large it couldn't fit into anyones mouth.  it had to be disassembled and eaten in parts.  other than that the meat was good and moist and the bread was fresh.  There could have been more bacon to balance out the sandwich.  there must have been at least a half pound of turkey on there and only a couple strips of bacon.  The side of potato salad was average.  Not like it came out of a tub, but not like it was something terribly special either.  was a mustard style with some relish.  big chunks of potato.\\n\\noh, and the mozz wedges were good.  when are they not good?\\n\\nservice was great!  glasses never emptied.  quick and attentive.  thanks jake.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: Do you like things that are awesome? Do you like chicken nachos? Do you like having the opportunity to see Michael Jordan in real life!? Then go to Selwyn Pub. \\n\\nThe service is always good, the fried pickles are always crispy and salty and while the beer list could be a bit better, you can always find something you like. The owner is also very serious about making sure the kegs are always fresh; no nasty tap line beer here! \\n\\nNow, let me get down to business on these chicken nachos. I think of myself as somewhat of a Charlotte area chicken nacho connoisseur, and while many have disagreed with me, Selwyn Pub has the best chicken nachos in Charlotte. It might be the atmosphere, it might be the crowd, it might even be the sodium, but they are amazing. \\n\\nNow to the best part! On to this MJ sighting. After spending many-a-happy hour on the couches of Selwyn Pub, I finally had an MJ sighting. In my book, if it's good enough for Michael Jordan, it's good enough for me.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I've dined there 3 times since it has opened.\\n\\nThe new location is great (albeit some what confusing to find the entrance - head to the northside of the building -counterintuitive to a building fronting Camelback Road). Love the ambiance on the patio and the bar area, dining room is okay (not a fan of the artwork).\\n\\nFood is consistently good. (Yes, portions are somewhat smaller than the old Houston's.) The prime french dip and fries are a favorite. Fish is always fresh and its nice that sushi was added to the menu (not amazing, but a solid option). Salads are crispy. Overall a solid dining experience.\\n\\nBar service is great - fast and friendly. Dining room service could tighten up, but give the service team a break and allow them to adjust to the new digs. \\n\\nFor the whinners that have reviewed Hillstone - please stay away. That much faster for everyone else to be seated.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Tranz, oh Tranz, why are you the only decent goth/industrial club in Phoenix?\\n\\nClub Tranzylvania, or Tranz as the club goers call it, will charge you $7 to get in on Friday nights and then what seems like $7 a drink at the bar. I wish they would drop the cover charge down or at least offer some drink specials! \\n\\nThe bar has its own set of problems: I just hate spending $40 on drinks and not even getting a buzz out of it. It's hard enough to tell the bartender what you want over the music, but it's even harder when everything you ask for they don't have (or maybe they think they don't have it because they can't hear me?) Mind you I'm not picky or difficult, I just expect the bartender to know how to make the drink I want or at least stock  2 of the 3 beers I'm asking for.\\n\\nSolution for the Yelper: If you can, drink before you go.\\n\\nSeating: Maybe, just maybe, invest in another velvetine sectional or two. Club Pallazzo certainly charges enough for cover to afford a new couch. I like to rest my pretty feet after I'm done dancing and people watch, and maybe I don't feel like going on the patio.\\n\\nThe Ambiance: The inside is gorgeous. It's definitly the atmosphere that brings all the boot-stomping night owls out en masse. The frescoes on the walls and ceiling sport scantily clad vampiresses looking for a bite, and the velvet curtains that hang from the ceiling to the floor, along with the throne chairs give the club it's regal aire.\\n\\nThe Music: It's true, they have different DJ's switch off sets. The DJ I like also DJ's at Le Homme on Wed. nights. If I don't like what's playing I head outside for fresh air on the ample patio. But overall the music is good. \\n\\nI know some people that go every weekend. If I did that, I would be living in the alleyway behind Tranz. I take friends from out of town and occasionally go myself when I want to shake my ass. If I found a place better than Tranz I'd be there. But this is Phoenix, and this, my friend, is as good as it's going to get.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "I don't think I would have known about Quiet Storm if it hadn't popped up several times in friends' Yelp feeds in the last couple years.  I'm all about veg/vegan restaurants, but I have to agree with other reviewers who wish Quiet Storm's food was *slightly* more interesting.  \\n\\nHusband and I ordered take-out so we could enjoy a late lunch al fresco at Schenley Park overlook.  Folks working were vegan-hipster quirky, but friendly and helpful.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our food, so we decided to partake in an afternoon coffee to pass the time.  I  had an iced Morroccan latt\\u00e9 with cardamom and rose,  husband the Mandorla sweet almond milk latt\\u00e9.  Both were excellent.\\n\\nFor my meal I picked the Tahini Bowl with brown rice, spinach, roasted red pepper, tomatoes, pepitas and fried tofu cutlet with a tahini dressing.  I wished there had been less rice and more dressing; the bowl was also screaming for more seasoning.  Husband opted for the Crunch Wrap Extreme: scrambled tofu tossed with celery, carrots, edamame, kale and spinach, dressed with vegan wasabi mayo.  Again, twice as much dressing would have added flavor and moisture to an otherwise fine wrap.\\n\\nAnd that's just it: the food at Quiet Storm is fine.  When really, I'd been hoping to be utterly wowed by the magic capable of being worked by nothing more than mere vegetables, plain grains and humble legumes.  Still, I won't discourage you from eating here.  I just might come back myself.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Been here many times.  This is the first time as a yelper. Hooray! They still give you a great biscuit and a deviled egg.  I live in Plaza Mid wood when I travel here from Greenville SC and I just  was too tired to venture very far. Actually I wanted steak but it seems that you are rather limited in this neighborhood for a really good steak.  I am strictly  a non drinker and something just didn't seem right about the Whiskey Warehouse. Besides I just don't want to spend a fortune at a chain.   Zada Jane's where I've had a great breakfast, was empty and too pricey for their steaks.  All this to say and ---- Hello! there in front of my eyes was trusty old Dish.  I guess it's going to be a chicken and dumplings night.  On the way in I note the special on one of those little sandwich boards outside on the side walk and decide that's it.  It was a brisket of beef with spicy orange BBQ sauce evening with a great side of potato salad and leafy side salad.  To the point, Lisa my waitress was great in helping me make up my mind and got my food to me in short order and also managed to chat briefly about the neighborhood. What was up, what was down etc etc.  My food? just great! Dish calls it \\\"comfort food\\\".  I looked around while I was eating and noted that the room was full of happy \\\"comfortable \\\" people.  In the back many of Dish's patrons seem to be thoroughly enjoying the bar.  The Place is solid! It's all about making sure that you enjoy your food and your visit.  If you have never been there, try it. You will be glad you did.  If you have not been there for a long time go back.  It's probably better than you remember.  BTW this place is great for lunch!.  Guess I bump my 3 1/2 stars up to four.

The sales staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about various leather selections/options and the size of our space and the sofa that best fit. As this ended up being more of a custom selection, I was worried about the manufacturing timeframe to meet the date of a large gathering at our house. The sofa was built and ready as promised and the delivery guys hit the delivery window of time as scheduled. Matter of fact they were meticulous, laying cover on floors and corner protectors so as not to mark up walls. We had an overall great experience dealing with this company. It is not everyday you buy furniture (or at least a sofa), so we took the time to shop and view multiple places. When the time comes we will be back here to buy again.

I mean, I understood why the smoked salmon wouldve been cold since that's usually how it is served, but the eggs were also on the cool side.  Cool egg yolk = kind of ick.  And the English muffin, that was kind of cold and ick too.  And at the slightly higher than average pricing, I wasn't expecting my food to be kind of ick.  The hash browns were interestlingly spiced, with onions and a hint of cumin, but like everything else on my place, lukewarm and quickly cold.  The place had been open for less than an hour when we got our food, so it didn't really make sense that the food would have sat out for any good reason.\\nI think I would try the place again if it were someone else's idea - like someone who really dug the place wanted to go and swore by some signature dish - but of my own accord, I don't foresee going back.\n\nReview rating:",

I kind of wish it were downtown Phoenix rather than so far up north, but I guess a girl can't have everything she wants, right?\\n\\nI'll be back to Moto soon, for sure. but the service needs much improvment.\n\nStars:",

        "During my recent trip to Vegas I figure I'll steer off the usual path and see what the locals truly enjoy here... Looked up online and found Food Express and decided to give it a go...\\n\\nDespite the fact that I've already had an early dinner, I was craving some salt and pepper pork chops so that was my target all along!  \\n\\nWell... gotta say that their S&P pork chop was pretty good... but since I'm from LA, I guess I've had similar quality?  But nevertheless it was made pretty tasty.\\n\\nI wanted to try other dishes so there will most likely be a future review from my next trip...  Thus hopefully increasing the star rating at least one star higher...\\n\\nIf the food is good, you may ask why I gave it a 3 stars?  \\n\\nTo me... if a customer gives you a bill to break for your bill even though it's not much of a change, you should always give back the change and let the customer decide what to do with the rest of the money... well, the guy hands me my food and said thank you....  I was going to give him the tip anyway but I didn't understand why he didn't place it in the tray and let me make that decision.... why does he have to make that decision for me?  Yes... I'm Asian, but I definitely would never do that because the change is still \\\"not my money until given\\\"  So that irked me quite a bit even if it's a little bit of chump change...\\n\\nHopefully my next visit all the food will be fanstastic and that they will actually give me my change back.... if not, I'm gonna once again raise hell on yelp about it for sure!\\n\\nDon't mind my rant.... enjoy your hot and crispy pork chops!

It's \\\"Seat Yourself\\\", but there were no signs stating this, so we stood there looking like fools for a minute. It took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and I'm guessing that this was Barb. She apologized and said that one of her workers called off today. No big deal and her apology was appreciated. She came back with our drinks, dropped them off, and left again. We didn't see her for another 20 minutes. Ultimately, we were there for 30 minutes before she took our order. This was aggravating to me. I don't mind waiting for my food if I know it's going to be awesome and they're making it with love, but come on now. We ordered the hot pepper omelette/home fries/ toast and chocolate chip pancakes/sausage. The food was alright, really nothing special. A new waitress ended up taking care of us and she was much more attentive. We may or may not go back.\n\nReview rating:",

I believed them because it's not that hard to put a good rub on a piece of meat and let it smoke.  I went because I heard they actually serve smoked salmon (which I love).  So I ordered the smoked salmon wrap, a side of coleslaw and a drink.  Total $10!  I know BBQ is a craft and I understand the pricing but I was expecting some great pieces of smoke salmon in a wrap with some nice spinach, other veggies and maybe some kind of dressing.  What I got was a puree of something that resembled salmon mixed with mayonnaise and something else wrapped up in the tiniest flour tortilla.  It was a little bigger than a twinkie.  The coleslaw was a good size and texture but lacked flavor.  They might serve good BBQ but from what I saw, the portions were really small.  Based on my experience today I will not be going back to their restaurant.\n\nReview rating:",

We entered and there were only two other  dinners in the place, one was a family of 5 and the other was a family of 3, we were a party of 2.  We were seated and told that are waitress would be with us in just a minute.  Well, that minute turned out to be about 10 minutes.  Having had time to read the menu about a dozen times while we waited, when our waitress finally did show up we were ready to order but she ask us if we wanted to put in a drink order?  Really???  So we did put in an order for 2 glasses of wine and asked for water as well.  About 10 minutes later we received our wine (very small pour indeed) and no water?  As we were waiting for our food order (I'll get to that train wreck in just a minute) we noticed that the other two occupied tables were having issues with their orders and all we could hear was the waitress consistently apologizing, we also watch as the other tables food was delivered, ONE freaken plate at a time, first one child got some breadsticks, then about 4 minutes later the other child got a salad, then about 10 minutes later the father got his order, then they apparently asked for water and it was delivered ONE glass at a time by the same server (not waiter???) then we experienced the same absolutely mind numbing food delivery, with the exception that I had ordered the 10\\\" pizza (which was pretty good after a 20 minuet wait) but my wife had ordered a chicken pasta dish, which we never received.  The waitress brought the pizza and two plates and started to walk away and I ask where my wife's meal was and she looked stunned, walked away and came back and told us that she had turned in the order but the \\\"kitchen\\\" must have misread it, but she would re-enter the order, well that was about 2 glasses of wine each and one very small pizza later, which had already taken about 55 minutes....duh!

They seemed in a good mood and provided very nice recommendations for wine, appetizers, and meals.\\n\\nThe wine selection is incredible but, i was disappointed with the tap beer selection.  Normally, I would ding a place for that but, this is the South and, beer is not considered a food staple as it is back home in Wisconsin.  Also, this is a pretty fancy place and, they tend to focus on wine.  According to my colleagues that are very into wine, the selection was quite good.\\n\\nI had the pork chop for myself, which was served beautifully but, a bit under cooked.  I ordered medium rare, it was rare.  They were very prompt and gracious about it - brought me a new one, perfectly cooked, and offered me a variety of other things to tide me over while I waited (it only took them 10 minutes to bring the new one).

The food at the buffet is hit or miss. The chicken tikka masala is acceptable but too creamy, and the chicken can be dry. Their tandoori chicken is great compared to other Oakland Indian spots, and the chicken curry is a bit bland but the chunks of dark meat chicken are tender and juicy.\\n\\nVegetable entrees usually fare better than the meats. Chana (chickpeas) are meaty and hearty, the rajma (kidney beans) is spicy and bold, and most other vegetable offerings are decent albeit a bit greasy.\\n\\nFresh naan is the best part of the meal, it's soft with a decent amount of char for a texturally rich bite. Don't order off the menu, the food isn't a big step up from the buffet and is overpriced (unless you get the tandoori meats, which are prepared quite well). Go to India Garden, Star of India, or Tamarind instead for a la carte.\\n\\nThe dining room is surprisingly quiet yet very dimly lit, probably to save money on electric bills. Hindi music videos play on the TV, and they have a fridge appropriately stocked with Four Loko.\\n\\nIn summary, go for cheap prices and middle of the road Indian food.

The owners were very kind and attentive. The food was delicious, fresh, everything was clean. The pho broth was the best I've ever had, delicately spiced and flavorful. They don't pre-cook the beef, which is excellent, so it doesn't become too chewy (it cooks in the broth). The second time we went to Pho Minh was the first night we got to Pittsburgh when we moved (this should tell you how excited we were). Coming from Boston, it didn't occur to us that it might be closing at 9pm. We got there at 9:15pm and they kindly asked if we wanted them to make us up some food to go. Even that was good.\\n\\nWe kept hearing, over and over again, that Tram's was freaking fantastic and we should go there instead. So we did. It was a mistake.

        "Review text:\nThis review is for two things: My meal, and the level of service that I got from this particular address.\\n\\nFirst let's cover the meal selection: After months of Facebook mentions from friends, popular media jokes and articles, speed eating contests and every reported media what have you, I decided to try the \\\"Double Down\\\" sandwich.  You know the one: Two pieces of chicken that have some sort of sauce, cheese and bacon between each breast like some sort of unholy abomination.  I had described it elsewhere as it being the equivalent of taking your stomach to a brothel, and ending up getting \\\"The Ugly One\\\" for your digestive tract.  It's... I'll explain more later.\\n\\nThe service?  I should have known what I was in for when the girl didn't turn off the drive-in microphone and started whining to her co-workers.  I should have further known in seeing the \\\"Love/Hate\\\" tattoos emblazoned on said server, because I guess while I should have found it endearing that someone had given her the apparent impression that this inkage choice was still somehow trendy and relevant in the 2010's, I couldn't help but realize that the someone who had made this opinion known was a liar.\\n\\nI was told that my meal was to take 7 minutes to prepare.  Okay, fine.  I hate waiting to the side at any fast food place, but I wasn't in a hurry.  One minute turned to seven.  Seven minutes turned to twenty.\\n\\nIt doesn't take a meteorologist to know that sitting in Vegas' lovely 100+ degree Summers is not fun for nearly half an hour.  But I was going to be cool (pun not intended) about it, go inside, and just ask about the status of my food.\\n\\nSo in I go (the other pet peeve I hate about the \\\"pull over and wait\\\" tactic), and present another girl my receipt to inquire about the status of my order.  The original girl saw me and had that pissed look of \\\"Oh no he didn't\\\" at me.  \\\"It will be ready in a minute\\\", she snapped at me.  \\\"Fine\\\", I responded  \\\"It was just too hot for me to sit outside.\\\"\\n\\nShe slings me the bag, and is...\n\nStars:",

        "I have been going to this shop since they were located at the end of Beck Rd. behind the DMV office. I have worked in the auto repair business myself and am pretty knowledgeable about the workings of an automobile.  This shop HAS NEVER steered me wrong! They are VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE mechanics. Last month I had an accident with my 1996 Camry and was fearful that the repairs would be more than the blue book value of my car.  Within 2 hours after it was dropped off at their shop, Mark called me with the diagnosis and calmed my fears. They worked with the insurance company's adjuster, let my car remain there for almost 3 weeks without charging me any storage fees while they shopped for parts which in and of itself wasn't easy to do considering the vehicle's age. I was consulted by their mechanic assigned to my repair, Jim, at each step of the repair. The total cost of the repair wound up being over $400 LESS THAN the insurance company adjuster's claim totaled. I LOVE THIS PLACE! and recommend it every time someone asks me if I know of a good, honest mechanic shop. My rating for this place is",

Imagine my surprise when I arrived at 3:30pm and was told that I could not order off the lunch menu because the kitchen was switching to dinner service. I pointed out that the front door has a sign stating lunch is served until 4pm. The hostess got the manager who refused to allow me to order off the lunch menu. I suggested they change their lunch hour to end at 3:30 instead of 4pm so this wouldn't happen to anyone else. As far as the food, I am Hispanic, and my food makes this food taste like fast food.

        "Review text:\nWe found Monroe Road Animal Hospital soon after adopting our little rescue mix. We've been with them for nearly 3 years now. Fortunately, our pup hasn't had any major medical issues but has been in for check ups, bladder infections, a clogged tear duct, and general new-parent worries. Our trips to the vet are usually efficient and we're typically in and out in about an hour from walking in the door, depending on what needs to get done. The staff is very responsive to questions and keep good notes about your pet's health; for example, our pup is highly sensitive to topical treatments. We only had to tell them once about her experience with topical flea/tick treatments and they recorded a note to avoid topicals in her chart without any push-back. They don't push meds or specific types of food or treatments, which is really nice. You can make appointments online or over the phone and the office is pretty quick to respond whether through a call or email. We get a follow up email after every visit to make sure our pup is doing well and seeing if we have any questions. We've called the office a few times to ask them questions that may or may not be related to a recent visit like \\\"what can we give her to reduce car sickness on our trip today\\\" or \\\"the meds are making her nauseous, what can we do to alleviate that\\\" and they're more than happy to check with the vet and get back to us within a few minutes. The office isn't going to be the nicest looking one you'll find, but the staff is always pleasant and responsive. \\n\\nThe vet also has a grooming/boarding facility and that is a different story all together (my rating is for the vet only, not for the grooming/boarding facility). We took our pup there once for a grooming and nail clipping and have never taken her back. She came running out looking very spooked and worried when we picked her up and her nails were split and hanging from being clipped.

        "MacAlpines is very interesting, a restaurant, thrift store and an antique shop rolled into one.  The service is very friendly, all the waitresses are in 1950's outfits like you would expect.  The food on the other hand is horrible!!  I got a ruben sandwich, it was pretty dull and flavorless.  I also got a side hawaiian salad, which was also flavorless.  My girlfriend got a veggy burger, which seriously tasted like saw dust.  It was so gross, I felt bad for her because I had suggested this place to eat at.  We should have order a malt or some kind of soda drink, because I think thats what this place is known for.  But we were just getting a quick bite to eat before we headed to the film bar.  At the end of the meal they gave us the wrong check, which we corrected.  Well, overall the service was pretty good, but the food was so terrible that I gave this review 2/5 stars.  I'll probably try this place again just to have a coke float or a malt, but I'm staying away from the food. My rating for this place is",

The last order was the tom yung, pad thai, and chicken pan'ang.  All were ordered at a five spice level.  When I got the food home and we started digging in, it was more like a 9.  I called to let them know and they basically told me it was my fault for not knowing that the peppers right now are much spicier.  Not sure how that is relevant.  If the peppers are spicier, you put less in so that a five is a five, not a nine!  They did offer to make a new order, but that was not feasible.  So they offered to give me a soup the next time I came in.  A soup?  Really?  I just spend $35 on food that was inedible and the compensation was a soup?  I told them that I would like a new order the next time I came in.  I was told I would have to bring in the old food for them to see.  So in order for this to happen, the food would sit in the fridge for maybe two weeks, then sit in my car all day and then I would bring it in to them so they cold look at it, and then if they maybe thought they didn't believe me that it was too spicy, they wouldn't credit?   This does not make sense.  I was going to do this, but then I took it as an insult.  I won't say that I am one of their best customers, but maybe once or twice a month.  This place is convenient, but there are plenty of Thai places that are just as good, if not better, so I figure I won't be patronizing them for a while.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

Another is I'm pretty good at avoiding places that are likely to be a 1 star experience.  And as a rule I usually find some redeeming qualities like value or service. But rules are meant to be broken. \\n\\nEnter Boudreaux's.  The first visit I was excited to try their etouffee because I love cajun food and like the etoufee at Cajun Queen but alternatives are always great. First we had to wait about 50 minutes for our food and after it came, I thought the etoufee was awful and the taste was bland. Perhaps I should have gone with the jambalaya or Shrimp and Grits, though none of the people enjoyed their meal. However, the meal just got worse when the server was pouring my sweet tea (apparently above me) and poured half a pitcher of sweet tea down my back. The server was off in Lala land or might have been on something because it took a chirp, or yelp if you will, to get him to notice that there was something wrong. So he then stood there and said \\\"Oh whoa dude...\\\" ... and so then I had to ask him to get a napkin or towel or something.  \\\"Oh, sure.\\\"  I don't make a big deal of things, so I laughed off the tea and apathy and attributed it to having a bad day. \\n\\nThen Mother's Day came around and I wanted to give it another try since it's an institution that has been around NoDa forever. They were having a brunch and I realize most places get overwhelmed for Mother's Day brunch, but this was truly amazing. The food took 2 hours and 20 minutes to get to us and was completely cold by the time it got to us. Really?? Really. So all we had during those hours waiting was weak bland coffee. They offered to remake the food, but I was worried it would take another hour or so.  Quel d\\u00e9sastre!

        "Authentic Thai food and decent prices.  The neighborhood sucks, but you didn't come here to look out the window.\\n\\nService was pretty good.  A few times I had to ask for more water, but the night was busy, and I drink like a fish since I ask for 10/10 thai spicy'ness.\\n\\nI ordered the pad kapao and pad see ew, both were very good and had tons of flavor, but pretty heavy with the oils.  I am used to eating at Krung Thai now, which is a lot more \\\"clean\\\" vs Komol and Ocha being more \\\"authentic\\\" and oily.  I do prefer Komol's over Ocha if you were wondering.\\n\\nWe also ordered a fried rice, and it was very good.  Next time I come, I will try some Panang Curry since I missed out this run.  Hopefully, you can't go wrong with this place!\\n\\nOverall, I will definitely be back.  If you are on this side of town and craving great authentic Thai, give this place a shot!\nSo I would like to give it",

Had hoped that a place that is generally pretty busy would be a great supper club, unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case.  The feel, the decor, the bar are typical supper club but the entrees...nope.  My wife and I have tried the Friday fish fry 2x and both times were very disappointed. The fish looked and tasted exactly like they came from a box of VandeKamps frozen fish filet.  Same unnatural shape, thin, with same breading.  Nothing like a true beer battered cod or haddock.  \\n\\nI think the only reason the place is busy is due to the cheap prices and lack of other options in the area.  We won't be going again, it may well be the worst fish fry I have ever had in my life.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

We out pizza lovers so would never turn one down however given the high rave reviews expected a bit better. Our pizza was good but was skimpy on the toppings and a little on the dry side. It may have been due to the type of cheese that was used and the lack of enough BBQ sauce to make up for the consistency of the cheese (which was not mozzarella) . As i said, I love pizza so still enjoyed it and like the flavor. I would probably go again but try something different.

I'm glad other people thought it was good but I will not be going back.  Me and a roommate got a pizza planning to split it.  We got about 1/3 of the way through, couldn't finish, and now he is laying on the couch with a sick stomach and I am dissatisfied enough to write my first review of any business.

This location is a favorite of mine because the owner is so friendly & always remembers my order and even knows where I work & always makes it a point to say hi at my work. Today I decided I would get a sandwich from this location which is about a 20 minute drive from where I live. Let me add that I'm 8 months pregnant with gestational diabetes so I am forced to limit my carb intake. So I figured they would have my back. I went through the drive through & ordered a medium turkey original on wheat add jalape\\u00f1os. That's it. No drink because I have water at home and can't have any sugar. I only waited a short time before my sandwich was ready & I was on my way back home to enjoy it. 20 minutes later I get home unwrap my sandwich to see that it's not on wheat bread so I can only eat a quarter of it (due to the amount of carbs in the white bread) but I realize that it's got a layer of jalape\\u00f1os and no lettuce. The lettuce makes the sandwich! Normally I would have eaten it there but like I said I'm 8 months pregnant & wanted to get home. Now I'm stuck with this sandwich that I can only eat in quarter increments per hour, that's not even what I ordered.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

Yeah, I go to a coffee shop, not to work on my PhD, but to look at you--that sounds realistic--who wouldn't think that?! Could it perhaps be that this person would look at me and I would notice and look up?  This barista has had both other baristas and friends of hers that would come in talk about me as well. I won't even state here what one of the baristas said because it was truly wrong.  However, I will state that one woman said to her friend that the original barista in question told her that I was \\\"crazy.\\\" I can't even believe that no one would not call out that crazy behavior from the barista--I just sit there and work, WTF. Anyway, I feel as though, despite being a coffee shop in a college town, one of the few open late, that they do not want regular customers, or perhaps my status as a PhD student is not good enough for them since it seems that because I go here often it is a problem somehow.  I sorely wish I did not spend my money at this place ever.AND,when I say PhD student, it is not to brag--I worked my a@@ off and nothing was a handout for all of  my degrees--rather, it is to say, no, I have stuff I am trying to do and perhaps rather than pay attention to others, some in AZ should just focus on their own life.\n\nStars:",

I brought it up to the guy and he proceeded to tell me that he was working new singers into the mix and if it was done the way I'm accustomed to karaoke being run it would have taken even longer. B.S.\\n\\n3) On the same night, I ordered a beer for my date and I. After finishing, I figured it might be better to just order a pitcher. I asked how much one was and was told by the older grey-haired bartender that I couldn't have one because they were out of pitchers! A bar. Out of pitchers! Unbelievable. Couldn't even have the courtesy to answer my question, didn't offer an alternative to make up for it, just told me I could buy another draft and he needed our glasses as he was out.

        "I love this church! I'm kind of surprised that this is the first review... Since moving to Phoenix from Minneapolis, I've explored several churches in an attempt to find a church comparable to Eagle Brook Church in Lino Lakes, MN. I unequivocally found a replacement with Central Christian. Specifically, I attend the Third Format service on Saturday nights at 6:30pm. This is a non-denominational christian church with all the beliefs one would expect from a christian church. On approach, the building(s) are modern in appearance and very large. Parking spaces abound, and the area is safe. While walking to the main worship center, you pass the children's center, a cafe and a bookstore. Once inside, the dress is casual, and the mood is electric. This service is tailored to a much more edgy crowd, and it is not like a service you may have expected: Rock-like worship music, Lights, Fog, People excitedly yelling out, and it's loud! Everything is so passionate. I love it! And It's addictive... In a good way. Five stars. If it's your first time visiting, I'll go with you. Let me know.\nSo I would like to give it",

The cheese blintzes which used to be authentic are not water down to a real sweet treat rather than what they used to be.  Their bagels, well they are not longer the original bagels they used to make they must be skimping on the flour and not boiling them as real bagels are boiled.  the fruit cup they give with breakfast is small and only about a mouthful when it used to be much bigger and the hashbrowns mixed with onions is way way salty avoid at all costs.  Will not be going back disappointed in the quality of food.  The service was great, but the food was not even 2 stars.

I won't go into too much detail, but I will say that it was good.  Not amazing, but good.  However, I have never had El Salvadorian food before, so maybe I needed to be broken in.\\n\\nI started with the mango iced tea which tasted a little like dirt, not horrible, but had a dirt flavor to it if that makes any sense.  I saw the guys next to me get these bright neon yellow drinks with chunks floating in them and decided I must try it.  It turned out it was the ensalada drink, which I thought meant \\\"salad\\\" but maybe that's my American translation.  Apparently it means \\\"delicious fruit salad\\\" drink.  I ate the chunks out of it, trying to figure out what each one was.  I was thinking it was something exotic, so I made Bri try it, turns out it was apple.  Oops.  So it has apple, pineapple and carrot chunks, maybe not exotic, but still delicious.\\n\\nThe little shooter of soup is good.  Its like a chicken noodle without the noodle with potatoes thrown in for good measure.  I got the appetizer combo that Michelle got, it was plenty of food for a meal.  I don't know what was what, but I like the flat tortilla looking thing with the cheese the best...it was either a pupusa or a posteles, but it was good!  The tamale was different than the typical, it was not wrapped in a corn husk but what looked like a palm frond, but I could be wrong.  Heck, I couldn't even identify an apple that day!  It also had shredded chicken, potatoes and carrots in it.  Very tasty.  They also serve this soupy tomatoey salsa that is very mild.  That, combined with the slaw they serve as a garnish really adds some taste to most of the items.  They also give you 1 \\\"tortilla\\\" per person.  Its their version of a tortilla, but much different than the Mexican version.  This is much smaller, and thicker, almost like a pita, gordita or fry bread.  My friend got some sort of chicken dish with a large amount of what looked... My rating for this place is",

        "I was in the area and I remember I used to go to this place about  5 years ago.  It was blah.  Nothing special.  There was only one waitress for a Saturday morning crowd.  That should have been my first clue.  She was nice enough, but it was still early.  There were only 4 tables with patrons, so I think she was managing.  I had the french toast, what can I say, it didn't taste like challah dipped in the egg mixture as they claim.  Not bad, but it was your run of the mill dinner french toast.  Usually when I am going to blow my calorie budget, I want it to be worth it. Now I just feel guilty and want to hit the treadmill.  I know I won't be coming back with the twins either, because the couple that came in while I was finishing my breakfast requested a high chair and the waitress told them all the straps in the high chairs where broken.   I need to make sure I keep my little rug-rats strapped if we don't want chaos. My rating for this place is",

It is important to mention I have no insurance and have my Medicaid application in process, but I do qualify. I let the intake nurse know this when I arrived. When I went back to triage, the nurse came in with a snarky attitude which I didn't mind too much with me being in pain. I didn't care. She drew three vials of blood and NEVER took them back for testing. The doctor reminded her to give me pain meds 3 times and she finally did with a nasty attitude. \\n\\nI went back for x-rays and an ultrasound. That all went fine. The workers were great and very attentive but by the time all of the testing was done, my doctor was off and I had a new one. The new doctor came in and told me what the ultrasound showed. He was nice. I asked him about my x rays and the blood tests. He said he didn't know anything about that and that I would be discharged. He said the nurse would be in to do paper work. I am still under the influence of pain meds and couldn't quite verbalize how shocked I was by the lack of information and attempt to look into it. I look to the left and on the tray I see MY vials of blood STILL sitting there. Are you kidding me? \\n\\nSo, I start getting dressed and a NEW nurse comes in.. She tells me to get dressed so she can assess me. She has no idea what's going on. I tell her I'm being discharged and she asks if I'm confused! I repeat myself and tell her I'm not confused, but I may sound a bit loopy from the medication. She leaves and talks to my first nurse and confirms I'm being discharged. \\n\\nShe walks me to the checkout desk where a very pretty woman tells me I owe $200.00. I tell her I have no money right now and I mentioned this on intake. Her reply, \\\"We don't talk about money up front, but you should have common sense to know that you need to pay when you see a doctor. You shouldn't have come here if  you couldn't pay.\\\" I guess medical...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Everything is tasty yet the service there is absolutely horrible. We didn't get any plates, water, and rice when all of our meat came out. Whenever we asked for more water or more for some help with our grill, we got an attitude and had to wait more. Took us about 3 hours to get done instead of an hour or two if we had good service. Won't come here again.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: I LOVE this place..  This is my sushi bar.  Danny, one of the two sushi chef's is awesome.  I have always found their sushi to be very fresh.\\n\\nAbout a year ago they came out with a special sushi menu.  With rolls like these: Dirty Harry, Mr. Miagi, Rio, you cannot go wrong.  Especially if you like spicy (like me)!\\n\\nEven the non-sushi is great.  This is one place my 6 year old loves that doesn't have a drive through window.\\n\\nAlso, $4.50 sake bombs!!!  $4.50!\\n\\nGo here.  Try it.  Don't be scared off by a couple of so-so (ok, 1 bad) reviews.  I am looking to even have a UYE here in the near future!  Should be getting a call tomorrow to get it scheduled.\\n\\nAlmost forgot!  They have some big screen TV's!  Watch sports here!  They are hugely popular for UFC fights and football..  \\n\\nJust go.  Now..  Seriously.  Review part is over..  You are wasting time reading the fodder I have written here.  You could be finding your keys..  Putting on socks and shoes..  Hell, skip the socks..  Wear sandals.

The manager did apologize and took an appetizer off the bill. I ordered pot stickers, corned beef sliders and French onion soup. Ehe pot stickers were the highlight of the meal. The sliders were ok, but the soup was dreadful. Not even any cheese in it with a couple pieces of bread floting on the top making it look like an unflushed toilet.  Don;t need it.\n\nReview rating:",

I've been to both locations for lunch, but this will be just for the one off Park. \\n\\nWe arrived at about 1:30pm for lunch, which is sometimes an awkward time to eat at a restaurant; the lunch rush is over, the cook is ready to prep for dinner and the servers are ready for their shift to slow down! Fortunately, we were promptly seated at a great table outside by the fountain. Our server was pretty knowledgeable of the food and seemed to have actually tasted all of them. She couldn't quite pronounce gnocchi in the specials, but the food and service was so good it didn't really matter!\\n\\nI had my \\\"usual\\\" the boscaiola with penne and their great side salad with house dressing. The dressing is very light, but delish. The bread is always warm and crusty (crusty good, not \\\"I wore these jeans 20 times before I washed them\\\" crusty). And that boscaiola sauce is like heaven on a plate!!! The peas! The prosciutto! The creaminess! It all comes together in an amazingly perfect way that leaves you wishing the plate had more than the 4 servings it comes with! BEWARE! You will want to eat all of it! Try to resist and take some home! I highly recommend adding some crushed red pepper flake to the sauce if you give it a go, adds a nice kick! My co-worker had the special portobello ravioli, planned on saving a couple to take home, but couldn't resist the deliciousness!\\n\\nI highly recommend Portofino's. The food is great and even if the staff can't pronounce all of the food on the menu, they're all still great!\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review: We have been enthusiastic about this Sweet Tomatoes for years and even were boosters of the Field Kitchen phase of the restaurant, but since the reopening, the sound level makes having a meal there a lot less pleasant.  In the old version of the restaurant, the music was in the background.   Now it is loud and relentless.   Every song in the playlist has too-fast-a-beat for a relaxing meal.  There is never a contrasting mellow track.  It is as if the plan is to play uptempo music to get people to eat faster and vacate the tables.\\n\\nAlso, one of the machines (the ice machine? the yogurt maker?) makes a throbbing sound most of the time.   It is disagreeable to have to listen to the machine's beat on top of the beat of the loud music.\\n\\nI hate to give this restaurant anything but a solid 4 when the staff is so friendly and does a wonderful job, but the noise of the restaurant always leaves me with a feeling of disappointment.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nOkay, so this place may not be in the fanciest part of town, but it's not as bad as some of the other reviewers make it out to be.  If you're looking for some great deals on professional quality hair product, this is your place!  I got tired of paying $10-15 for shampoos and various upscale hair treatments at CVS, etc. or simply couldn't find most professional stuff at grocery store type of outlets.  I'm a hair fanatic and want to buy the things the professionals buy and use.  This is a large store, and yes, the customer service could be better.  Basically, just go in and wander around and look at everything. If you have a category in mind, you'll soon find what you need or just have fun browsing.  I bought 6-7 different things, total came to about $50, and none of them were more than $4-5 each whereas in a regular store or online, the same things would have been $10 or more each.  Ladies, don't be ripped off buying at retail places when you can come to a beauty supply place like this and get it for half, and far better professional quality items.  One reviewer said she got \\\"attitude\\\" from other customers?  I didn't experience that at all.  I just went in, shopped and browsed, picked out my stuff and purchased.  Didn't have any problems.  They don't have shopping carts, just baskets, so if you're buying a lot, your basket can get heavy lol...but hey, nothing in life is perfect.  Will I go back?  Absolutely!  It happens to be in a location that's convenient for me, so that's a big plus factor.  Btw, their store hours show that they open at 8am.  I looked online and at their website for store hours and couldn't find any, so at least the day I was there, it's 8am opening time. Anyway, yes, they need to have a few more people available to help customers find what they want, but hey, I can't find anyone to help me at Target or Walgreens most of the time either, so I'd rather buy upscale hair product (and hard to find or impossible to find items), than go elsewhere.  I'm glad I found this place!\n\nStars:",

The sandwich was huge! And delicious! The turkey was sliced to my liking, the bacon crisp and the added touch of mayo on a fresh Kaiser Roll, OMG! I could only eat half so I took the other half to my Mom, who is from New York, and she loved it. The wait staff is great, but definitely favors the regulars, so maybe I will be one soon.

It would be hard for me to recommend this to anyone. I was staying at the HGI and decided to walk down the block to experience this place and it's history. I would not recommend walking as this is not an area to be walking around in at night. The host was also the busser. For a slow night it took her awhile to clear a table for one person. I was told to try the chicken fried steak, supposedly a signature dish w/ Mac and cheese and baked corn. With a side of mashed. The best part was the wait for the food as the beer was cold and my server was quick to bring another as my meal was slow coming out. The steak had a frozen taste, the mashed potatoes had onions in them and the sides were not tasty. By looking at the measured portions they are struggling with portion costs. Usually not a good sign. I found myself in a hurry to get out. The best thing I can say is the staff was pleasant and making the best of what I am sure is a tough situation.\n\nReview rating:",

You can go there one night and have great food and service, whereas you could go there on a totally different night and experience the complete opposite.  The same goes for the food.  Some dishes are awesome (shrimp and grits, stuffed chicken) while others I would definitely shy away from (pizza).  If you are a beer lover, they have some good brews which are actually crafted on site.  The beer can be better than the food more times than not and I would recommend people to go here for that more than the food.  The Southern Flyer is great for pale ale folks like myself.  If you give this place a shot, prepare to roll the dice because you don't know who you will get, or what the food will be like when it comes out.  The one thing you will be guaranteed to have if you are so inclined is a nice brew made on-site.  Can't beat that sometimes...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review: Let's start this review at a 3-star (A-OK = not good/not bad) rating.\\n\\n+1 star: They have a Badger Bus for home-game weekends. It costs $5, and includes a coupon for a free drink when you get back from the game.\\n\\n+1 star: The bowling alley looks nice. It's a small space, but clean-looking. I don't know prices. I'll give them the +1 for appearances.\\n\\n-2 stars: The food is terrible. TERRIBLE. After the WIS v UTEP game, the wife ordered boneless Buffalo chicken wings. They came out deep fried and hard, with almost no flavor -- there was NO BUFFALO SAUCE ON THE WINGS! (We think the B-sauce might have been fried onto the chicken, but, if so, the flavor was lost in frying).\\n\\n-1 star: The service was lacking. Following the game, with all 50+ people who had just come back on the Badger Bus, there were only 2 servers, and they were also the bartenders! Service was slow, haphazard, and careless -- the guy never once asked how the food was, nor did he ever actually stop at the table except long enough to take our order. Drinks were dropped on the fly, the food was all but thrown as he whizzed by ...\\n\\nOverall, 2 stars. I'll go back for the Badger Bus and the bowling, but I will NEVER eat there again.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nThere are many Korean restaurants on campus that are readily accessible for students at UIUC. The market itself is a war zone. With that said, each and every one of those would try to have their specialty to out-do the others. A-Ri-Rang, in my opinion, does stand out compare to its competitors in its own unique way. \\n\\nIn my personal opinion, I find A-Ri-Rang to be much cleaner than its competitors. Furthermore, the layout of the tables were done in such a way that it would not block incoming traffic, which, if you are a regular at Woorijib, would probably understand what I mean. \\n\\nEvery day, there is always a lunch special going on. And it is most definitely worth every penny! For approximately $7-8 dollars, you would get a bowl of rice, a fish, and a soup of choice. Now, this may not sound like a lot, but the soup that comes with it is more like a stew. I always get the Soon-dobu jigae (forgive me if I spelled it right). In English? Tofu Stew. It is a LOT more filling than you think if you never had it before. Trust me on this. \\n\\nIf there is anything you really need to know about A-Ri-Rang, is that their stew/soup food items are superior than their competitors. Therefore, if you are not sure what you want to get, if you stick with this guideline, you really can't go wrong!\\n\\nWith reasonable price and delicious food, I would highly recommend this place to anyone!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I was searching everywhere for a jeweler to take an engagement ring in for sizing that has been in my family for 3 generations, and after going to one jeweler, I received a quote of $150 for the resizing and for an apparent prong replacement around the center diamond. (My fianc\\u00e9 and I were not budgeting that much). We then left and found Burland. When we took it in, we were greeted and helped right away. The main owner took a look at the ring and when we told him that another jeweler said we'd have to replace all four prongs, he tested it and to our surprise, the prongs were perfectly fine and did not need replacing at all! He even had his brother, who was the gemologist, come out right then and there and take a look at the ring. We were given a quote of $45 for resizing, but we surprised once again when we were charged only $40! The service was great and it was so nice to know the ring was in great hands. I got the ring after the weekend and it was flawless. It looks brand new!\n\nStars:",

        "I had an issue recently that was not handled well. My apartment flooded twice. The first time was due to a part breaking in my washer, the second was because the part they ordered to fix it was \\\"faulty\\\". They replaced the washer after 6-7 calendar days. But only offered to have my carpet cleaned even though this is the second time and that carpet was ruined and smelled. This is one of a few incidents that I've had. There communication with you during something like this is crucial and they definitely dropped the ball. The office staff said I was being hostile and rude but what they didn't understand or help me with was communicating what was happening when and how long things would take. If they had to live in a damp apartment with fans blowing and a two year old wanting to play they would understand. So, this being said, just hope you don't have issues that need attention and don't get smokers below you who smoke inside. I loved this place pretty much for the other 2 1/2 yrs. after finally dealing with Monica the area manager it was all resolved and taken care of. Sucks they have to get approval for everything too because the company is in CA.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: I enjoyed the Arizona Ultimate Women's Expo.  It was something that of course was geared towards women, but I saw several men there as well.  I must have entered at least 15 drawings.  Deidre Hall was great.  It's an even better time if you can get a few girlfriends to go with you.  There were 4 different stations for alcohol samples.  Some of them were good some not so much, like the Senorita Limonita.  That was horrible.  If anyone plans on going in the future, plan ahead.  I totally didn't even think about the Diamondbacks playing.  I had to drive a little bit further for parking, which was worth it.  It only cost me $5, whereas every other lot or garage I saw, was $15 or $20.  Also, take your time when walking through the expo.  There's so much to see and do.  Find out when the keynote speakers go on and when demos are, so that you can get the most out of it.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Prior to reserving, I joined Hertz gold plus rewards to get any additional discount available. Arrived at hertz, lobby was packed. A woman walked along side the line and asked were there any gold plus members. Of course I said yes. She informed me that I didn't have to stand at the back of this line, I could go to the gold plus member location. So off I go. Walk into the booth, sales person asked my name and said you can pick up your car at at #'d stall. That was easy!\\nGet to the car, it looked fine as far as I was concerned. I get to exit booth where they electronically scan your vehicle before leaving lot. At this point the attendant asked if I want to prepay for gas. Not being a frequent renter of cars, I ask...How does that benefit me? She says that when I get back, \\\"We will fill the tank up at a rate of $3.11\\\", which is cheaper than the street. I agree. There's no price quote before they run my card. I get a long folded receipt, my mistake was in not trying to hold up the line, knowing what my daily rate was, I didn't look at it.

        "The employees are nice, polite people and the train seats are comfy with lots of legspace and outlets, but oh my god, Amtrak trains are almost NEVER ON TIME. Grab a book or something in case you wait from 30 minutes to two hours for the train to arrive so you can board it. It's because the railroads are prioritized for shipping cargo, so the train will stop and wait for long periods of time for them to pass. This means you, the passenger, will most certainly be delayed. I do not recommend taking the train if you have to connect to another ride or be somewhere at a specific time.\\n\\nRegarding ticket prices, it competes with Greyhound in terms of cheapness. Usually buying tickets a month in advance will give you the lowest price of $15. Then a week later, it pops up to $22, then $29, and finally anywhere from $30-159 on the week or day of your travel day. Once the normal seats sell out, your only option is to buy a ticket for the bedroom style compartment (which is in the $100s). It is ridiculously expensive, so I suggest buying a ticket from Peoria Charter or Greyhound if you miss the $15/$22 prices. It goes to Union Station and from there, $5.25 will take you via Metra to the suburbs. Hence you pay less then a bus ticket if you plan accordingly.\\n\\nThe train itself is really nice and clean. Pick a nice smelling passenger to sit with and you'll be fine. My only bad experience was this creepy old guy who kept talking on the phone then fell asleep on me. Ughhh. They have a cafe with tables in the back of the train that sells lots of food like donuts, Starbucks coffee, Redbull, fruit, etc. It also has a bar where a nice man in a suit and tie will mix you a drink or give you a beer. The wifi sucks though and is not reliable in my opinion. Greyhound and PC do it better, but Amtrak is much more roomier and inexpensive.\nSo I would like to give it",

Just to be on the safe side I called stores to ensure that they had a few dresses in size 14 that I could try on. I was told at J. Majors that they only have 10's maybe a few 12's (street size 4-8). The excuse that \\\"this is what they send us\\\" is not a valid one. In my search for \\\"the dress\\\" I have been to quite a few stores that have selections for all sizes.

        "So if you have one of the cars with the safety feature which honks the horn every time you lock the doors (and scares your baby or wakes the neighbors) good luck with getting these guys to fix it. The dealer said this is a safety feature. I will be getting a new car in a few months and I assure you after how my daughter was treated these guys don't have a shot at my business. Part of the problem is that vw made the decision to lock the disable function out of the user parameters on higher trim models. Hey guys take a look at the Jetta forums and see how your customers feel about this. The solution is a program called VCDS and a $10 cable from eBay. Problem solved. This issue didn't have to come to this, this is an easy fix at the dealer (change a single param in the long code.) instead they goofed my daughter around and lost any sales in the future. While it seemed like the bulk of the problems  were coming from a single service writer, left a bad taste in all our mouths for vw and this dealership. Other than the stupid horn thing the new Jettas are nice but I can't recommend this dealership because of how my daughter was treated. If you purchase a new vw with this annoyance I would recommend making a deal to have them reconfigure before you write the check. Safety feature my butt..... My rating for this place is",

        "I'm really starting to wonder about you, Phoenix.  Usually, when I look at Yelp reviews and see that there are 20+ reviews and the place has 4 stars, that's a legitimate measure of how good it is, but since moving here, I've been to several places like this - some with even 50+ reviews - that are simply mediocre.  Are your brains so addled by the sun that you've forgotten what food tastes like, or is this just a symptom of the terrible offerings of Phoenix as a city?  I'm not sure yet.\\nLenny's is one of these cases.  I went in here expecting a home run from reading all these reviews, and I splurged and got onion rings and a shake based purely on your recommendations.  Sure, it was a well-put-together burger, and the options they have are fairly novel... but it was just okay.  The toppings were kind of meh, especially the onions.  But most importantly, the burger was extremely salty.  I believe I saw them putting some sort of powdered topping on them on the grill, which, fine, but... less please.  The saltiness really took the quality of the burger down for me.  Otherwise it would have been much more solid.  The saltiness alone reduces the chance of me returning.\\nService was fast, that's a plus.  It's true the location offers you little.  It's functional.  It's fine.  Whatever.  But the onion rings were frozen (so are the fries) and the blandest I've ever had in my life, so the guy below who said they were the best he ever had, well, I hope you get to have some better onion rings soon.  Considering this fact alone, I feel that Lenny's is a bit overpriced.\\nThe one part of all these Yelp reviews that is 100% unadulterated truth is that Lenny's has outstanding milkshakes.  They do taste homemade, and it's fantastic.  They have many flavors for you to delight yourself with, and they are sumptuous and indulgent without being too heavy.  I will almost certainly go back to Lenny's for a shake if not a burger.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Things started out pretty well; on a Friday night at 6, the wait was only 15 minutes. Pretty much everything was downhill from there, though. They put us in a cozy area downstairs, which was fine, except that they essentially forgot about us. The salads came after the food, only because I reminded the waitress that we never got them. It took the waitress about half an hour to come get a dessert order, and then another half hour to flag her down to get the check. Then another 20 minutes for her to come get the card. It's now been 15 minutes, and I still haven't seen her again. \\n\\nThe food was actually pretty good, and would have earned the place 3 stars, but a hair in the food bumped it down notch.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: Uno Chicago Grill offers a terrific menu, including their irresistible Deep Dish Chicago-style Pizza where every last bite (including the crust!) is delicious. I've frequented Unos numerous times in multiple cities, including Orlando, Rochester & Syracuse NY, and, of course, the original Pizzeria Uno and Pizzeria Due in Chicago. However, the Uptown UNO in Charlotte is a disgrace to the UNO name. Twice now, we've attempted to eat there, only to be met with poor customer service skills at the hostess stand. The first time was an early evening, and there were about 10 people (different parties) in line, empty tables...and nobody being seated. After five minutes of not seeing any hostess, we left. The second time, we visited in the afternoon for lunch. We were pleased to see that there were people actually dining in there, several empty tables, and only one couple waiting to be seated. We watched as the first couple were seated. Needless to say, the one hostess on duty never returned. Having watched her every step of the way in seating the last couple, it seemed like she was just wandering through the restaurant aimlessly, not doing much of anything. And she never acknowledged us previously either. We waited for about five minutes, watching her, not doing much of anything.

        "Review text:\nI've fequented here often enough to know that all the majority of the games here are all those ticket games and little claw type games. I come to hang out with friends and play some games. I can in on tuesday night around 6pm and thought to have dinner there since I had a coupon for the place. I really didn't care about price at the time with the coupon.\\n\\n After being seated our waitress got our drinks took our order and everything was fine. After we recieved the food we were left unattended for quite some time. When the waitress finally returned I had to ask for a refill and some ketchup as well. My drink was empty so I would assume that would be something that the waitress would ask but I caught her before she left. My boyfriend did not recieve a single refill the entire night and we were there from 6pm to 9pm.\\n\\nWe had friends meet us there and we just chatted it up for some time. It wasn't for some time that we realised that the place was bare not just of customers but of staff as well. It was as if they closed the place down and just left us. After the waitress had taken our check and cashed us out that was the last we saw of her. The plates of our food were still in front us the entire time and we had kind of placed them all together so that she could come and just take them...kind of thought that the bunch of plates stacked together would give the hint we were done but I guess I shouldn't be so subtle next time. \\n\\nThe food was ok at best. Nothing bad nothing good in hind sight though if I had to pay full price for what I got if that waitress had left us like she did and I didn't frequent the games I would've walked out. Probably wouldn't notice. \\n\\nAll in all go for the games if anything else. The games are even ok that is IF they are running. Sometimes I come in and games are off or not working. This is just a place that is convienent for myself and friends to meet up.\n\nStars:",

I brought my coworkers here, and they all ended up eating here at least 2-3 times.  It's just that good.\\n\\nSo how good is it?  Lets just say that their tortilla soup was the only thing that could cure my horrible hangover after a long night in Scottsdale!\\n\\nI've eaten the fish tacos, fajitas, enchiladas, nachos, and tortilla soup.  All were exceptional!  They also bring out chips with salsa, as well as beans, which was a nice touch.\\n\\nThe dining area is fairly small, but they do have an outside dining area as well.  The wait staff is very friendly, and they will get you drinks as soon as you sit down, which is something that more restaurants should do!  The food comes out very quickly, and they do have 2 TVs, one on either side of the dining room, which are usually tuned to a sporting event.\\n\\nI've been out of Phoenix for 3 months now and I miss Mi Pueblo!

Checking in and out was very simple.  The staff is also very friendly.  It really feels like they'll do just about anything to help you out.  The day after I reserved my unit online, I got a call from the manager to confirm the reservation and see if I had any questions.  On my first day, my gate code wasn't working, so she gave me a generic one until the problem could be sorted out.  I was given a working code by the end of the day.  The only negative about the office is there only seems to be one employee working at a time, so you may have to wait.  It also closes in the early afternoon so that employee can go to lunch.  Moving in and out is also pretty easy.  There's also a couple of flat dollies left around to help you out, but I recommend bringing your own, they seem to disappear once in a while, even if you're the only person on the premises.\\n\\nThe only thing I don't get is the hours.  The storage area is accessible from 6am to 9pm.  The office is only open from 9:30am to 6pm.  If there are going to be so many hours with no on site staffing, why not just be accessible 24-7?

        "Review: I was very excited to get this massage. It had been a while since my last one and my shoulders and back were a wreck. I made an appointment request online for a 2 hr massage for the next day. The receptionist called me about 30 minutes later. She was able to get me in a hour later than my requested time and confirmed my 2hr treatment. \\n\\nI arrived at the clinic 20 minutes early and got started on my paperwork. Once finished, a nice receptionist reviewed my paperwork and made notes for my therapist. She recommended the deep tissue therapy ($12) for my shoulders and it sounded like a good idea. \\n\\nShe took me back to the \\\"relaxation room\\\" to wait for my therapist. My therapist greeted me on time and took my back to the room. We reviewed my concerns and talked about my back issues and that I wanted a full body massage. \\n\\nTime for massage!!! It was the second worst massage I've ever received in my life. The therapist paid no attention to the muscles running down either side of my spine, or my lower back. She did the \\\"deep tissue therapy\\\" which consisted of hot towels, warming oil, and biofreeze. NOT WORTH 12 bucks!! The massage on the rest of my body was pretty lackluster. It felts like she was just moisturizing my skin with lotion rather that working on muscles. My sister gets my muscles better and she never went to school for this. \\n\\nI realize she is rushing things, missing whole areas, and not duplicating what she does on one side to the other. Then I realize, no way this is a 2hr session. \\n\\nMassage is over. Thank god. I get dressed and look at my phone and realize it was only an hour. Okay- that's an excuse for rushing. I go to the front desk to check out. Whoever scheduled my appointment did not schedule the 2 hours we had discussed. The receptionist did offer another hour with another therapist, but by then I was so frustrated I just wanted to leave. \\n\\nMy goals for this massage were clear. Relaxation, stress relief, loosen up my traps and shoulders, and get a good honest run down. Needless to...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

We saw that Super 8 was having a crazy anniversary sale on rooms where if you booked online on a certain date and time, your room would only be $8.88. We decided this would be the perfect oppurtunity to head down to Champaign so we tried to book the room and got it.\\n\\nThis is the point where I tell you if I had paid any more than $8.88, I would have felt ripped off. The room smelled very weird (that smell that makes you think someone could have died in there but they used enough chemicals to kill every last skin cell), the bedding was very itchy, and the shower curtain didn't even have any plastic liner to keep the water in the tub. The only positives (the reason it gets two stars instead of one) were that there was good pressure in the shower and the location was not bad.

First of all, when we got here this place was SLAMMED, like no room to breath because of their fish fry and Lent (I guess?) and most of the clientele were older people. As the night went on, the crown thinned. I didn't eat the food, so I can't comment on that, but I had a few drinks. At the beginning of the night, the drinks were not very good and hard to come by. They did get a little better (could be based on my choices... started with a tequila sunrise that wasn't so good, but later got a coffee with Bailey's which I liked). The best part was the price, very inexpensive with drinks costing about 5$ a piece. So, this was just kind of okay. My main complaint was the karaoke. They clearly had favorites and picked the same names over and over while others didn't get to sing at all. We were a large party and were dropping serious money here, so I thought they would be a bit more welcoming and fair with our group. I get that they have regulars, but still not a good excuse.

        "For a long time when my mate and I walked past the store he would mention he would like an IPOD. So being the perfect mate I bought him one for his birthday. He opens it and said, why did you buy this I would never use it. I will spare you the rest of the conversation. So I go back to the store with the product in hand. I tell them I want to return this, I tell them why. They seem totally dumbfounded and find it very hard to accept that I indeed did not want the product. SO they ask a million question all assuming I did something to the product and rendered it unusable. Any fool can see it never came out of the box. So I repeat why I am returning it. Finally they say ok and tell me there is a restocking fee. I say OK as I had read the receipt. He said wait a minute. So I wait and he returns with what I assume is the manager. He starts his bull crap and literally yells at me about the fee and said I am going to have to pay it. I respond that yes I know of the fee as I told Him, point at the other employee. I have no problem with that, never did, never said I did. They finally took it and credited my card minus the fee all while they snarled at me. I guess I will never find out if I like Apple products as nothing on Gods green earth will ever induce me to buy from such imbecilic company. My rating for this place is",

It wasn't the best I've had, but was tasty enough to satisfy my Tres Leches cravings now that I won't be returning to Houston on a regular basis any longer. The cake was moist and sweet. There was a little too much \\\"frosting\\\" on top for my liking, but that can always be scraped off. Next time I'd like to try the chocolate.\nSo I would like to give it",

If you are coming here, I'm guessing you are not looking for the pinnacle of authentic Chinese food. Sorry to say, but these harbors aren't so golden. But, for a very low price, you can fill a styrofoam box, and your stomach to the top. I got orange chicken and beef & broccoli over pork-fried rice and 3 (soft/stale) almond cookies for $6.95.

        "Oh Taylor, you are one tasty cafe!! \\n\\nI visited Taylor's Cafe several years ago for lunch and had a great experience. However, I hadn't been back since, just because it always seemed to slip my mind. That is, until I was reminded of it today by the one and only Gabi M. \\n\\nRight off the bat, I like Taylor's Cafe because the moment I step inside, I feel warm and cozy. The restaurant isn't very large but it isn't cramped either. It lives up to its name as a cafe! The servers are very friendly and brought my a Diet Coke right away and kept refilling and refilling. Bad for my caffeine addiction, yet good for my caffeine addiction if you catch my drift. \\n\\nSo moving on to the food. I love tuna, but my waistline doesn't like the mayo that normally goes into the tuna. However, today I learned that Taylor's Cafe can feed my love of tuna without the mayo calories! How? They make the tuna with fat-free mayo! So, I quickly ordered the tuna on a wheat tortilla wrap with avocado and tomato. The tuna was fresh, delicious and didn't taste like fat-free anything! I ordered a side of cottage cheese with it. It was good but a little bland, so I added some hot sauce and it gave it just the kick it needed. \\n\\nNow that I've been reacquainted with Taylor's Cafe after all these years, I plan on coming back over and over again and trying everything on the menu...or maybe just sticking with the tuna. It was pretty darn good. My rating for this place is",

My father-in-law ordered sausage patties, scrambled eggs and buttermilk pancakes. I ordered thick sliced bacon, scrambled eggs and buttermilk pancakes. The food arrived very quickly and piping hot. Everything was delicious! I could have sat there and eaten bacon until closing!\\n\\nMy only drawback is...I'm not a fan of warm syrup because it becomes to watery.

        "The Roadkill Grill was featured on Diners, Drive-In, and Dives so I knew I had to stop by and try their barbeque grub. This little spot was definitely hard to find! It's hidden away in a residential neighborhood and the grill itself is located in a little butcher shop. Bascially the butcher shop set up a little cafeteria-style barbeque service where you go through the line and they scoop what you want into little styrofoam take out boxes and you go outside and eat at little pinic tables. I was skeptical at first, but boy I was definitely glad I went out of my way to try this place. \\n\\nThey have a variety of BBQ fare ready to order like: hot links, brisket, ribs, pulled pork/chicked which can be served with a side of baked beans, mac & cheese or potato salad just to name a few. Everything was really delicious and packed all the flavors of what awesome BBQ should be. \\n\\nThe hot links were featured on the show and now I know why! They're made fresh in the shop and have the perfect amount of spice. And I can not tell you enough how good the baked beans are! I must have licked my plate clean!\\n\\nBad thing is that you have to eat outside in the Vegas heat. However, they have fans set up with misters, which helps somewhat. Or you can take your order to go and enjoy in the comfort of your own home. I'll be back, that's for sure. My rating for this place is",

Nothing special compared to other pancake places, but any stack of warm pancakes late at night is delicious to me.

        "My husband and I use to frequent this place at least once a week. I'll have to say, if you're a big meat-eater, you may be a bit disappointed as there are hardly and dishes with meat.\\n\\nWhen you enter, you start out going through a traditional salad bar with a couple already-prepared salad dishes, or you can create your own (heck, why not try it all?) There are also pasta salads, brocolli/raisin/bacon salad (delicious!), and plenty of dressings/toppings.  After you go through the salad line, you pay/get your drink/find a seat.  We always went at odd hours as the traditional rush hours are horrendous and not enjoyable in my opinion.\\n\\nAfter we finished our salads, we went up to the other part (it's kinda difficult if you want 2nds on salad b/c other ppl are going through the line so you'd have  to squeeze in and yeah, not a fan of getting evil glances unnecessarily) which offers about 5 different soups, fresh fruit/jello, mac n cheese and a pasta dish, baked/sweet potatoes, pizza, muffins, dessert (usually cobbler), and there's a soft serve machine too.  The fun thing about Sweet Tomatoes is that each month has a new theme, and if you subscribe to their emails, you get weekly coupons which can save lots of $$!  \\n\\nI think one of the only reasons we don't go there as often is because I started a diet about a year ago and stopped the buffets.  Obviously it was just too good.\nSo I would like to give it",

I dont understand why people are complaining about their service. She was overly kind and informative.

It is a little far from the main campus area (30min walk from Green St) but it was worth it.  It is clear from the pastries that someone cares in the kitchen.

        "Review: This needs to be posted on every APS Yelp page until they consolidate all of them. \\n\\nAPS is absolutely deplorable. They have a complete monopoly on Phoenix.  Consumers don't have a choice for power service provider and because APS knows this, they charge like old mob racket. I have had service with them, again, no choice, and one day I get a letter stating that I have a security deposit required. I had service at this new address for 5 months before this came to so I called. They told me because I was past the due date that they can at their discretion ask for one. EVEN AFTER SERVICE HAS BEEN CONNECTED.  I obviously have no choice in the matter. I asked them what past due meant. They told me after 13 days!!! My mortgage allows 30 days. The credit bureau reporting system is based on 30 days. The whole world works off 30 days. Past due after 15. Very crafty how the bill is due JUST before most people would pay their bills from their paycheck on the 15th. \\n\\nThey charge me 1.5 times my bill for the last 12 months. Now remember, I have only been there for 5 months so rather than judge it on MY last bills which are low, I have to be averaged off of another family. So the deposit was massive. \\nSo I tell them (based on principal) that I cannot afford to pay it. So they say they will separate it into 2 payments (how generous). So I make the first payment of 80. Mind you, this is NOT for services rendered. \\nNext month I get my bill in the mail, and like every month, I pay it.  \\n\\nFew days later my power gets shut off.  I think its a building fuse or from a storm, but as I am walking to the maint office, I see the yellow tag on my meter. \\n\\nSo I call APS and say WTF?? They tell me I was shut off for non payment. I quickly log on to my bank and see it was paid and I tell them this. They say, \\\" no, it was for security deposit\\\". I asked them what do I owe on my service. They said nothing. I said, so I got disconnected over an arbitrary deposit when my bill is paid in full? They said yes. \\n\\nThey then tell me...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Sandwiches don't come with anything but a pickle, so you have to order fries on the side if you want.

I really can't believe that this could taste so plain. The meatballs weren't all that and the sauce was actually less flavorful than what I get from a jar. My wife's chicken parm was good (just the chicken - the rest suffered by the mediocre sauce) and both meals were only saved by the generous portion of fresh grated cheese on top that the waiter applied. \\n\\nBest bets: They have wonderful bread. Forget the olive oil they give you to dip it in, ask for their butter. Oh. My. God. I could actually go here to eat their bread and salad alone.

However, it's a good thing it's there because it's one of the few non-burger/fries joints in this particular stretch of Phoenix.\\n\\nThe food here is pretty decent. I've had three or four different subs here and they've all been tasty. Nothing mind-blowing, but certainly appealing to the gut. The food is pretty affordable, provided you stick with just a sub and get your drink and side elsewhere. Their menu, as has been mentioned in other reviews, is pretty extensive but unnecessarily so. They'd be better off presenting the customer with a handful of distinct sandwiches and then listing all of their toppings. They literally break out each variant of a particular sub and list it as a separate menu item, which ends up just being kind of overwhelming.\\n\\nThe people that work here are very friendly and the service is brisk, making this a hassle-free lunch stop for the businessperson on the go.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: One of the worst experiences I've had in a long time with a business. I purchased tires from them with their warranty about 6 months ago. Three months ago one of the tires had a leak. They repaired the tire and sent me on my way after leaving the car there from 10am, they finish repairing the tire at 4 pm. A few weeks later the leak is back. They repair it again, this time I drop it off at 8am and they still finish at 3pm.. Another two weeks and the leak comes back again. Finally they are willing to order a new tire. It takes them two months to get the tire, with me calling them every week to check if it's in. It's funny how when I first wanted to buy the tires they were able to get it the next day, but when they need to stand by their replacement warranty, it takes 2 months. Finally they get it and I drop the car off at 11am on a Wednesday. They do not finish with my car until 3:30pm. I'm pretty sure it doesn't take four and a half hours to change a tire. Will never do business with them again and will warn everyone I know about them.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I like the orange chicken a lot, it tastes like something you'd pay a lot more for in a sit down restaurant.\\n\\nOnline ordering is apparently a gamble. Today I ordered, received a confirmation email and 90 minutes later hadn't received my food. Gave them a call and they claim they didn't get the order. They said I could wait another hour if I still wanted food. Kind of a let down. :(\\n\\nI'll probably be less ticked off in time and they really do have great food, but a bad customer service experience just stings a little.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

No this is not a gentlemen's club it is a a restaurant that just lacks windows. \\n\\nFor Mother's day they had a buffet only setup, and what mom does not love cold food that has been sitting out for an undetermined  amount of time. The croutons in the Cesar salad were soggy as were the crustinni under the bruchetta. The pasta was cool. Even worse the butter soaked farm raised salmon cubes were just luke warm. The vegetables were mush and again just luke warm. The mozzarella in the caprese on the buffet was not made in house as it was firm and flavorless. \\n\\n\\nThe real amusing part was on the dessert section. There was a plate of items straight from Costco, lemon bites, cookies and cinnamon twists just as you would by at Costo, on a plate and picked over.  \\n\\nThis is one relic that is better left in the past, horribly dated decor, sub par food at high prices means this place should be avoided.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

The service, atmosphere, prices, and most importantly cuisine are nothing but top notch at this establishment!!!!!!!  My server, whom by the way, has been in the hospitality industry for over 23 years, that I have had the pleasure to be served by for over 10 of those years, and is a well known and appreciated all around great and hardworking individual in the community got rather the short end of the stick tonight.  The table of four came in during,(as always Arrivederci had a rush during dinner in the restaurant side) as well in the lounge, would make any kitchen busy. Of course the kitchen is busy, but always highly productive in preparing food.  The table griped all night, rolled their eyes their server, complained about their entrees, and to my horror even after the \\\"happy hour in the bar only\\\" got explained to them, actually got up from their seats and walked to the bar, ordered drinks and so non- chalantly came back to their table!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Who does this????? P.S.  THEN. . . . . . as the server cleared the table, he opened the bill folder and saw the \\\"YOU'VE BEEN YELPED\\\" card!!!!! What I don't understand is why \\\"shoppers\\\" feel the need to come in and make the exprience the worst it could possibly be and treat the servers like that!!!! Why can't they just come in and have the real restaurant experiece the way we all expect and do when we walk into any other establishment or Arrivederci's?????   I have been coming here consistantly year after year and speak from experience first hand!!!!  I feel for the poor server who had to deal with this kind of behavior.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Having been here a total of three times I have never experienced much of a wait.  All three visits I've been in and out in less than 60 to 75 minutes.   On this last visit I was experiencing severe back pain and because I'm paranoid and couldn't pinpoint an injury, I assumed my kidneys were in trouble. Thank you, Google.  Of course just turned out to be muscle strain.  The doctor for this visit would get zero stars. One of the prescriptions she gave me was so new that no Smith's or Albertson's had it. When she was called from the pharmacy for an alternative she said no, and  she wanted me to drive to CVS or Walgreens looking for it. She just saw me barely walking and expected me to drive all over town. Unacceptable. After I got on the phone with her and told her what I thought she gave an alternate prescription bur I shouldn't have had to do that.\n\nStars:",

If their pho is as off-base as their banh mi, it must be made with linguini. Though the price was right ($4 for a sub and a big steamed bun), everything else was wrong.

        "Review text:\nEver since we went to Thailand in September, thai food in the states just doesn't seem to measure up. I just moved back to Vegas after being away for a few years. My hubby read the great reviews about this place so we decided to check it out. We got the Masaman and Pad thai, both with Tofu. The Masaman was okay, nice curry flavor, definitely could have gotten it more spicy (6 was too low) especially because it was a fairly sweet (as in taste) dish. The pad thai I thought was disappointing because it was VERY greasy/oily. There was a film all over the plate and you couldn't eat the noodles without getting the oil/grease everywhere. The serve was excellent though. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The thai iced coffee and tea were both good. I just think I'm still on the prowl for my favorite Vegas Thai place.....there was a place I liked when I lived here years ago...I'm going to try to hunt it down!!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

The food has always been great, because they are almost always very slow, service is quick.  \\n\\nToday, different story.  My husband went In to enjoy a beer.  And was denied service!  The working bartender said it was because he couldn't legally accept my husband's Swedish driver's license as proof of age.  (He's 25 & looks it! Not to mention, we have been here several other times, and his form of I.d. has never been questioned or rejected before by any other member of the staff.)  The bartender was rude and stubborn on his stance.  \\n\\nSo, I did some research and nowhere can I find information or proof that the law requires a certain type of I.d. or that the one my husband gave today is unacceptable. \\n\\nBefore writing this review, I called the bar and spoke with said bartender myself.   Calmly questioned why my husband was denied service.  He explained that their bar only accepts certain forms of I.d.  and \\\"we\\\" don't accept that here.  I made him aware of the plentiful times we've been serviced no problem with that specific I.d. at THAT bar.  He argued that no one should be doing that.  So I explained,  as to not seem nor be ignorant,  that I did my research and there is no accessible information about this I.d. not be acceptable.   His response that he actually isn't familiar with state laws regarding I.d.s but this was the rule there.\\n\\nI think it's totally wrong.  I respect proper checking of I.d.s.  I respect bartenders that care about servicing of age customers.  But my husband is clearly of age, has been serviced on multiple occasions there and elsewhere,  and his I.d. is as legitimate as they come.  Picture and date of birth clearly listed.\\n\\nDisappointed with Henry's today and that the bartender offered no compensation for his wrong doing.  \\n\\nSo, if you should still decide to go to Henry's, I strongly advise bring one of their very own special required forms of I.d. or you too could be denied service after you've walked in the summer...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

My husband and I had so much fun dancing together for the first time here!!   \\n\\nHOWEVER, from the moment you walk in, be prepared for the Hard Sell.  I bought a 5-lesson intro pack for my husband, and although we loved the dancing, the really pushy salesmanship from the moment we walked in the door slightly tainted the experience for us.  \\n\\nWe may very well continue dancing here, but the steep prices for a lesson package and pushy sales tactics are keeping us in the \\\"thinking about it\\\" category.  \\n\\nIf you want to learn to dance, and money is absolutely no object, come here - you won't regret it!  Otherwise, think carefully first.\\n\\nWhy 3 stars instead of 1 star??  \\n\\n1. The instruction really was tons of fun and the Arthur Murray system is a strategy that's quite organized, clear and effective.  \\n\\n2. At the end of our package, when we explained that we would have to take at least 6 months away from dancing due to prior commitments, our instructor didn't try to insist that we buy lessons immediately (not a time-share level of selling - think car dealership). \\n\\n3. Friends of ours tried a different studio in the area for wedding dance lessons and had exactly the same experience - hard sell from the beginning, and exorbitant prices for lessons.  Apparently, this is par for the course.\\n\\nAnother reviewer posted about a very similar experience.  Sadly, I didn't see the post until after we went, or I would have felt far more prepared.\n\nStars:",

The person taking the order did not even know what we were ordering so he had to go to the back to see if they make it. Come to find out yes they do so we ordered that and some sweet and sour chicken. When we got our order the Tom Yum soup did not look like what we normally order this one was full of noodles and had no mushrooms but we tried it anyway took a couple bites and that was enough for us yuck. Next was the sweet and sour chicken yuck fried way to long and the chicken was dry. My fried rice was suppose to come out with my chicken but they forgot to make it so I had to eat my chicken and wait for the rice to come out like it was my dessert. When the cook saw the waiter throwing away a whole bowl of soup she was curious why so she asked us. We told her that Tom Yum soup we are use to is not full of noodles come to find out the waiter ordered us the wrong dish!! She made us a new batch of soup to take home I have not tried it yet so we will see. I wish they would not have family helping out that does not know anything about Thai food.

I can never eat it all, the portions are extremely generous, but it's never very high quality. Just kinda seems like it is coming from a slop kitchen, and not really fit for a human. The house margaritas are actually pretty good, and a fair value. I recommend hanging out with a margarita and some chips and salsa (also pretty good) and then moving elsewhere for dinner.

        "Review: We went to Zinc to celebrate my son's new job.  After having made reservations, I was a bit non-plussed at being seated one table away from the kitchen.  Aren't these the tables for late comers?  As is my usual practice on a first visit to any establishment, I just suck it up and wait to get on Yelp.   The servers were very good and friendly - a bit touchy - lots of shoulder taps - which was okay, I guess.   I really couldn't decide whether this bothered me or not.  For about ten minutes, we had the sun directly in our faces.  The servers suggested me move a little to be out of the sun and assured us that it would only be a few more minutes until the sun would be out of our eyes.  I guess they can't afford window coverings.  This is when I noticed the extremely dusty banquette - I even stood up and ran my finger through a healthy accumulation!  Good grief - I am sitting there, eating 32 bucks worth of scallops and staring at dust.  Geez.\\n\\nFood was good.  It was expensive.  I felt okay about the prices, though I was not wowed to the point that I would make this a regular place.  If you look at Marie-Eve's review, they came in late, without reservations and were seated in the PATIO!!! Maybe we should have done that.  The wine list is pretty good, but no bargains there.  I might give it  a go for lunch some day, since my son's new office will be near there.  \\n\\nAnyway, to make myself all better after this not so great experience, we went to Delux Burger for dessert and nightcaps, otherwise, I would have pouted all night.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Thickener paste too pasty. \\n--Salad very crispy but was too cold. Some pieces had given in. Tomato too cold. \\n \\n--Cannelloni masterful. Finished in pizza oven. Worth the trip. \\n--Chicken Marsala. Masterful recipe. Alcohol just peeked through and the mushrooms, parsley and drops of lemon finished it spectacularly.

It had just been started.\\n\\nTHE CHEF!\\nChef appeared after I was enjoying my main dishes with a bucket of ice to fill the bins in front of me. He didn't say a word. Humble as ever.

What they don't tell you is it really costs $83 for this meal.  So.....we spent $25 on the coupon for $50.  You will pay the difference on this deal, plus drinks and they add a $20 tip on top of this (for you to cook your own dinner!!).  We felt totally ripped off when we got the bill for $79.63!  This is a VERY misleading coupon.  We have not had this problem with others from local dines.  Needless to say, we will not go back to the Melting Pot again, nor recommend this place.  Local Dines needs to be more specific with the coupons and what you are really getting.

Chunky pieces of yellowtail are mixed with spicy mayo in side with slices of yellow tail and scallions on the top.

I honestly felt discriminated against because we were 24 year olds. I saw no young people seated in the bar room and saw so many booths with two people at them I thought it was universal date night. Instead we were with \\\"our type\\\" in the back room receiving second hand service. My waitress spilled water on me while attempting to fill my glass and just giggled and put napkins over it. Haha are you serious? Again, thank god there were big screen TVs to watch or I might have cried out loud. \\n\\n8:45- fish fry arrives; soggy, greasy, and not very warm. Best part of my meal was the spotted cow and cheese curds for an app. \\n\\n9:15-I feel sick and want to go to sleep. My night is over.\\n\\nAdvice for anyone under the age of 30- don't eat here. Go somewhere fun where you are treated equally. Food and drinks-30 bucks. Gas money to get there-6 bucks. Never eating there again-priceless. \\n\\nThanks for reading\n\nStars:",

Generally the fish menu is sustainable but when I commented to the waitress about the CRITICALLY ENDANGERED Chilean sea bass she didn't even know the difference between farmed and wild caught fish let alone what sustainable meant - wait staff needs to be trained on that. Quality and flavor of the dinners was great overall, but the risotto side dish had zero flavor - where's the salt?? Beautiful view but in my opinion NOT totally worth $100 per person for dinner...and that didn't even include an appetizer or dessert!\n\nStars:",

        "Review: I was in the mood for something I don't always get for my lunch break last week so I decided to go to Z'Tejas.  I'd been to their other locations but never this one surprisingly.  The hosts at the front were very friendly, the one who walked me to my table actually stayed and made conversation for a couple minutes which hardly ever happens anymore.  My actual server was very friendly too.\\n\\nI was very happy to see that they had a Build Your Own bar where you could pick from a Bloody Mary, Mimosa, Screwdriver and one other drink I can't remember and it was incredibly cheap!  Only $4 for my Bloody Mary!  They had a wide variety of choices too as far as juices, fruits, vegetables, seasonings, sauces, it was hard to decide!\\n\\nFor my actual entree I ordered the Hickory Burger which has barbecue sauce, chopped onions, bacon, jalapeno mayonnaise and a couple different cheeses.  It was delicious!  Kind of a mess to eat but worth every splatter you get on your face and shirt.  I just wouldn't recommend ordering it if you're with someone you're trying to look dignified in front of... The fries were great too.  Nice and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.  I was definitely happy with my decision to switch up my lunchtime location and I will for sure be coming back in the future.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: I was at this location tonight to pick up a magazine as a gift for somebody with a 20% off coupon I had received in my email.  When I got there, the news-stand section was closed off and I could see all the shelves were covered in plastic sheets.  I went up to the checkout, since nobody was at or near the customer service desk, and asked how long the section was going to be closed.  I was told it was going to be a week or so.  I explained to the cashier that I had a 20% off coupon that expires on Sunday and asked if there was anyway that they could extend it.  The cashier responded, in an extremely condescending tone, that no they won't and if I wanted to use it I'd have to go to the Madison East store.  I've worked in retail for over six years and would never dream of telling a customer something like that.   B&N thinks now that Borders is gone, they can be rude to their customers and get away with it because they think \\\"Hey, they've got nowhere else to buy this stuff.\\\"  That is a horrible attitude. This is just another reason for me to order from Amazon.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The cold case is way smaller than most other places and they don't have all the usual salads available, including the one I came looking for which was the Tailgate coleslaw. No BBQ area, no pre-cooked meals to go or salads to go either. The smoothie place on site uses frozen fruit, not fresh fruit as well.

I would hate to see what a normal room looks like.  The corner room has 2 full size beds and is like a triangle.  You do have space but very little and the bathrooms well the toilet and the shower are like touching each other.  You can barely close the bathroom door if you want to do business in private!  The corner rooms also that face 4th street just expect a night of loud music as that side faces several rooftop bars and they play music loud late into the night.  Only saving grace is putting in the AC fan but that is loud as well.  Either music or white noise.  The signature lounge...again...small.  Overall the lobby is nice, nice restaurant and attached to BofA and the center of town with everything in walking distance.  As I said....for location unbeatable.  For a luxury hotel for the price NOPE.\nSo I would like to give it",

I have someone who can vouch for me on this.\\n\\nHead chef notwithstanding, this is an absolute lock.  If you want a delicious dinner (or lunch) there is no question that you'll get it at Houston's.  And I will make the bold claim here: they serve the best cheeseburger in the state.  When the fries are right, they are amazing--thin yet crispy and deliciously salty on the outside but steamy and soft in the middle.  Yet it's the cheeseburger that gets my vote every time.  And this is in spite of the fact that I have had the hawaiian rib eye (amazing), the chicken sandwich (delightful), the prime rib sandwich (a savory taste sensation) and even remember fondly the best pork chops I've ever had at a restaurant, back when they served them.  (Butterflied with--yes--a tab of butter melted across the top of each side.  Fuck.)  But it ain't broke, so every time I get the cheeseburger, medium, no onions, and the juices ooze out to form an oh-so-tempting puddle on my plate--generally the only evidence that something edible even graced the plate in the first place.  Trust me on this.\\n\\nAppetizers: The smoked salmon appetizer is fucking ridiculously good.  And I don't even like salmon.  Also the chicago-style spinach dip.  For dessert, if they still serve the warm five nut brownie, get it.\\n\\nSides: if they offer the braised cabbage, go for it.  The brussels sprouts are also a delight.\\n\\nWait: get over it.  Dress relatively nicely because they claim to have a dress code.\\n\\nBottom line: one sure way to know if someone is a moron is if they don't like Houston's.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

As I was paying (cash, since they only allow debit/CC cards at a minimum of I think $5), he asked if we were going to stay there for the evening or just to-go.. me, total optimist, thinking he is going to offer us the wifi password or even a sample of something or just plain being friendly and talkative, was surprised when he said \\\"yeah, because you have an outside drink and we don't allow those, so you'd have to leave\\\" adding a fake sorry face... my sister, next to me, holding her Starbucks water container filled with WATER... I'm thinking \\\"really??? are you serious??\\\" I was super surprised at that statement and frankly, really annoyed.  I just bought a product and am being told that because she has a Starbucks CUP (not even a Starbucks coffee), she has to leave.  WTF!\\nYou can tell that totally did not sit well with me.  We kindly said we'd leave as we were going to go shopping anyway... \\n\\nTHEN, as I go to shake the nutmeg and the cinnamon in to my latte (this is how I fake myself out that my latte is sweet without the extra sugar), I shake and shake and the flippin' spices come mixed with SUGAR - both nutmeg AND cinnamon... what's the point?  There were already 3 different kinds of sweeteners there... My rating for this place is",

        "Review text:\nMy husband and I had breakfast at La Grande Orange today. It was our first time and even though parking was difficult I had really high hopes going in. I read up on the reviews from my fellow yelpers out there--and was ready for the challenges that eating here brings. Even though I knew about the long lines and needing to find a table first--I still found it difficult to navigate through this place! \\n\\nOnce we got to the counter and we ordered, I was shocked that our bill was over $25. I had the oatmeal with an English muffin and he had the Daybreaker--egg white omelet--we each had OJ and that was it! I asked for a little side of cream and some butter for my oatmeal and it didn't come with our meal. When my husband politely asked for it--the gal at the counter showed little in the way of customer service skills and pretty much treated him as if she didn't have time to deal with his request--a common denominator from other yelpers as well. \\n\\nMy oatmeal was decent (although I've had better at Taylor's Cafe--costing about $2 less, much bigger portion and it comes with fresh blueberries, strawberries, banana's as well as cream, butter and brown sugar! :-). My husband's omelet was completely tastless--it was an egg white omelet with smoked turkey breast with avocado and tomato salsa. The tomato's were nice but the omelet had no flavor except for the salt from the turkey. If you're expecting cheese in your omelet--be sure to ask to have some added! It contains exactly what the ingredients lsited on the menu reads--no more, no less. The smoked turkey is your average sliced sandwich turkey meat on top of the egg white rolled up with the tomato's and scant avocado pieces tossed on top. \\n\\nI'm so disappointed--maybe we just ordered the wrong things? When looking around we did see some delicious looking sandwiches and it did seem that people were enjoying their food, we were just wishing that we were enjoying ours as well. We finished quick and got outta there. \\n\\nWe'll probably give it one more shot some time down...\n\nStars:",

I'M NOT DONE!!\\\" (I won't mention the airline, being that it's my airline of choice) -- so, yeah.

Mind you, I have been here several times before, so its not my first time.\\n\\nThe benefits of Einsteins is that they make all their tasty bagels in site. Flavors are tasty, with Asiago cheese, onion, garlic, and a few other flavors as well.  Great selection of different flavors of bagels.  They also have a few different options in cream cheese flavors as well.\\n\\nThey also have a great selection of lunch sandwiches, which I like.  Great selection pastries, juices, etc.\\n\\nWhere they loose points with me, is I don't care for the service here.  I always always always have to stand in line and wait; not only to place my order, but to pay and recieve my food as well.  Some could argue that maybe I am being fussy.  Others could say that I need to be more patient at times.  I do not argue that point. BUT, nothing irks me more then waiting...and waiting....and more waiting.\\n\\nI have never NOT had to step in line here, regardless of time of day.  Why is that? I don't understand.\\n\\nAlso, I feel that service here lacks.  I always see multiple staff members behind the counter.  If thats the case, why is it always the same 1 person taking orders, and one working the register?  I also sense that maybe other customers get frustrated with this experience as well.  I go here becuase they do have great bagels, and their stuff is tasty...but at the cost of waiting....and iffy service.\\n\\nPlus, sometimes this place is NOT super clean.

        "Katrina M. had stumbled upon this place not too long ago and was telling my other friends and I that it was the place to go. The drinks are cheap and strong. The atmosphere is fun with a large dance floor in the center and one lone go-go dancer... on a pedestal. I am not exactly sure where Charlie's is going with their mixture of drag queens and gay cowboys, but I'll roll with it. I am all about the western shirts anyways. Let's not forget Katrina M.'s favorite thing about the bar, the disco cowboy boots. That's right, forget about disco balls (even though it would be just as fitting), boots are much better.\\n\\nEach night has a certain theme and there were too many for my buzzed mind to wrap around. Tuesdays are drag queen bingo night starting at 9:30pm. I might just grab one of my Filipino moms and \\\"drag\\\" them along. Thursdays are all day country music and half price drinks. Line dancing lessons are provided as well. I caught that much. There are inked nights to show off your tattoos for free booze. Underwear nights for those who have an aversion to pants. \\n\\nSunday apparently is not one of the hopping nights. We came around 1:30am and it was semi busy at the bar, but barren everywhere else. The room gets smoky quickly and the ventilation is not that good. The bartenders are fun. A mixture of some sass and honest is appreciated. While one made fun of our initial hesitance to drink and our quick jump to doing shots, another was kind enough to tell us to wait a few minutes until they started their happy hour. After 2am, beers were $1.75.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I'm from Central New Jersey, otherwise known as Mumbai West, where authentic Indian restaurants are three-deep in every single strip mall.  Indian food is my favorite ethnic cuisine, so I know good Indian when I eat it.  And Samosa Factory is that good!\\n\\nThis was our first visit, and it's now our new favorite Vegas Indian restaurant.  The food was terrific, the service outstanding, and the waitress, Katie, was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  Just as important, we were made to feel welcome, by her, as well as by the owner.\\n\\nWe started with veggie samosas.  I love them, but don't often order them, because they're usually heavy and greasy.  Not here.  The pastry covering was light and flaky, the filling was fresh and delicious, and it was one helluva stuffed samosa.  The accompanying coriander sauce was the best I've ever had, and the chutney had a deliciously different taste.\\n\\nWe had Chicken Tikka, which was cut in bite-sized pieces and mixed with green and yellow peppers, onions, and an assortment of flavorful spices.  The dish was brimming with flavor, and happily, it didn't have the overwhelming heaviness that I always dread at Indian restaurants.  My nit with this dish is that we were sharing it, so presenting it on a small, flat plate made it a bit difficult to transfer to our own plates. \\n\\nWe also shared a Chicken & Spinach Curry.  I hesitated before ordering it, expecting the spinach to be drowning in cream and ghee.  It wasn't.  And the cubes of chicken were the most tender I've ever had.\\n\\nThe Onion Nan had an abundance of onion and again, was lighter and less greasy than I expected.  We also ordered a side of Raita.  I was intrigued by the description, which said that the yogurt was mixed with Granny Smith apple.  Hmm, different.  And it was; the apple added a slight sweetness, and was the perfect complement to the tanginess of the yogurt.  It was the outstanding accompaniment for the Chicken Tikka.  \\n\\nThe Mango Lassi was great, too.  (Be aware that the restaurant has no liquor license. ...\nSo I would like to give it",

I went in person to place a to-go order and the place was really busy - it was filled with people sitting down to eat, waiting for to pick-up a phone order, and placing to-go orders. The woman who took my order was still really friendly and patient, despite how busy it was. I ordered a large one-topping pizza ($10.50 with a coupon I found in the paper menu sitting on the counter), a dozen Honey Hot boneless wings ($7.99), and a small salad ($2.99). The wait was 20-25 minutes but the woman was upfront about how long it would be, and the food was definitely worth the wait!\\n\\nThe pizza was really good - tomato sauce that was savory, not sweet, the right amount of real mozzarella, and a crust that was the perfect combination of crunchy and chewy. The wings weren't the best I've ever had, but they used good-quality chicken and had a pretty flavorful sauce. The salad was also pretty good, with fresh lettuce and pepperoncinis. A lot of pizza places skimp on the salad, but this was a decent side salad for ~$3. \\n\\nVenezia's is a great place to get good-quality NY pizza and sides. They deliver, but I'm not sure how far they'll go. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.\n\nReview rating:",

        "My 2000 Audi S4 was in need of a full inspection and to see what it needed for repair, so I found Auto Xtreme Service on Yelp and decided to give this repair shop a try. I went on their website and used their Contact page but I didn't receive any response. Several days later, I decided to email them directly. Finally, I received a reply and we coordinated a time and day to bring my car in for a full inspection.\\n\\nI brought my car in and stopped by at the front desk. It took the staff awhile for them to notice me and I had to call them aloud to make myself known. I spoke with their employee and told him about my S4's situation. After leaving my car there for the night, I get a call the next afternoon that I should stop by to look at their parts and labor estimates. He provided a very detailed document of what parts needed be repaired, the labor costs, and etc. I asked which parts are the most critical parts that I need to take care of first and he was kind enough to bring the mechanic in, who fully inspected my car. The mechanic (I wish I knew his name) was really nice and pointed out which parts I needed to take care of. He also took the time to explain in detail to me why that part was broken and how that part works. I was really happy that he was patient enough to explain everything to me.\\n\\nI told them that I would look over the document and give them a call. I noticed that some of the parts seemed overpriced (not to mention the labor cost). One of the parts was priced out for $770.00. I jump on to ECSTuning.com (OEM/Performance German parts company), and found that it was $85.00 and the brand is from an OEM company. I researched all the other parts that Auto Xtreme had documented and found parts are priced higher compared to ECS Tuning. I emailed the employee back and told him that I would buy my own parts and would like to schedule an appointment. Unfortunately, they don't install customer supplied parts and that was the end of it.\\n\\nThe pros that I can find are that their mechanic I spoke with is...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: Im not a huge fan of Mexican because what so many consider \\\"authentic\\\" is bland and tastes like retirement food. When it comes to Mexican I prefer the frou frou such as Padre's or Barrio. So when the Urban Spoon app picked this place I was a bit reluctant but I go wherever the Urban Spoon App takes me. I had preconceived notions about what this place would be like. I figured order at the counter, they make it ,you sit down and eat it. I wasn't even close. It definitely would be what most consider \\\"divey\\\", dimly lit, tons of booths and dare I say \\\"adorable\\\" with full service inclusive of bar. Tvs in the corners with various sports going on, menus with pictures (awesome)..everything is numbered so you dont have to make an ass out of yourself trying to pronounce something you know damn well you have no idea how to.  Service was fast and with a smile, no complaints there. Now for the food. Im not a fan of the corn tortilla..possibly because Pink Taco was the only place I ever had one and it left me with the wrong impression. So I ordered their Taco Siberia (double wrapped in corn tortilla) and now I understand the fuss. It opened up a whole new world and I am no longer a corn tortilla hater! But what I really want to rave about is the side of potatoes and onions I had. OMFG. Freakin awesome. They were like perfectly seasoned non french fried french fries?Its the best way to explain.. trust me, order and you will understand. This place is true authentic flavorful Mexican food and the prices were ridiculously inexpensive. Such a find.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

It seems silly that, when the Taco Bell craving comes on, we should drive past one to go to one better, yet I think I should start doing this now.\\n\\nThough it's been through several changes in management in the two years we've lived in this area, this Taco Bell is almost always the same: lackluster, unenthusiastic employees and dirty surroundings. The tables are never, ever clean, and there is rarely someone at the front - the cooks have to call for someone to get to the register when someone comes in.\\n\\nLast time we were there, there were no straws, the tables were dirty despite having been open only 5 minutes, and the drink machine was malfunctioning, spraying soda everywhere.

A local recommended Bubba's, and I decided to give it a try.\\n\\nThe location is nothing pretentious, just your basic hole in the wall BBQ joint.  They do Eastern North Carolina Style BBQ (vinegar and pepper sauce), and they have a red tomato based sauce for chicken and ribs.\\n\\nI had a combo of chopped pork bbq and a bbq chicken breast quarter.  The chicken was incredible, and the sauce, a little on the spicy side, complimented it very well.  The BBQ was just a little dry and definitely needed sauce, and the vinegar sauce complimented it very well too.  I also had slaw, baked beans, and a small bowl of Brunswick stew.  I wish I had ordered something other than the slaw--I'm sure there are people who like vinegar based cumin seed full slaw, but I prefer mine mayonnaise based--just personal preference.  The beans were exquisite, you could taste the molasses and brown sugar in every bite.  The Brunswick stew was the most different I had ever seen.  It had the consistency of a cross between white chicken chili and chicken and dumplins.  It was quite good and included chicken, tomatoes, lima beans, and corn.  Although it was different it was some of the best I've ever tasted.\\n\\nIf I were a local I'd definitely be a regular.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\\n\\nBottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh.\nSo I would like to give it",

I've never been to a Macaroni Grill but heard some pretty great things about this place through the roomie. Because it was yet another new place, I took hold of the opportunity to review it!\\n\\nMacaroni Grill is definitely accessible and located on one of Henderson's busiest streets for restaurants and retail, Stephanie. The restaurant is located in a stand alone building and part of a long strip mall. As I was educated, all Macaroni Grills look the same indoors: You walk down a ramp to the hosting station. To the left of the station is a bar area and to the right is the open kitchen. Pass the station and you'll see a bunch of booth and table top seating. The colors are rich in browns and red. The tables have a cloth on it and then white paper on top of that so you can draw on it. The entire feel definitely gives off an Italian vibe. \\n\\nOur server was Sara. She was definitely a nice gal and super personable. At times though, it was a little too much. She would linger around the table and make jokes about something, even if my roommate and I were in the middle of our conversation. She also checked back with us a bunch of times. Too many, it seemed like every two minutes. I think it was because of the lack of guests for lunch. That meant more time with her tables. I appreciated the gesture but could have loved it more if it was done less. \\n\\nFor lunch, I got the Pasta di mare for $18. Scallops, mussels, shrimp, fettuccine, white wine, pomodoro and garlic. The proteins were soooo good! All three were perfectly cooked and really was the star of the dish! I loved that the fettuccine was aldente, not mushy and held onto the tomato sauce. They sliced the garlic so you had huge chunks in the dish. For me, that was great. \\n\\nThey also had a special going on for appetizers. You pick two items off a list for $9. We got a total of 4 items and here's what I thought:\\n\\n-Goat Cheese Peppadew Peppers - This was a cold dish....\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I was VERY pleasantly surprised. \\nAlthough the exterior of the building isn't very nice, the patio seating was perfect for this spring day with protection from the sun, a casual ambiance and attentive wait staff. \\nThe menu is pretty typical, although they indicate Gluten Free items, which is very rare for Thai restaurants! This is super cool and much appreciated as it's more difficult for me to intuit ingredients in \\\"ethnic\\\" cooking. \\nThe vegetarian Tom Ka was brilliant and our curry dish was one of my husband's favorites ever. We didn't try any other menu items. \\nI didn't experience the scene inside- we were dining on a weekday for lunch, so I can't speak to that. \\nAll in all, a great experience.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Food was expensive, but very good.  This would have been an easy 4+ rating but I repeatedly got jabbed in the back by a food server's tray three times so I'm steamed and have downgraded this to two stars.\\n\\nAfter reading Yelp'ers reviews and talking to my co-workers who were very positive about Stockyards Restaurant, I really had a desire to go.  Thanks to Erica's Yelp review she turned me onto the happy hour and recommended seating at the bar.  I found it easy to find two center bar seats at 5PM on a Friday night.\\n\\nBartender Tom was great; touted the Happy Hour prices, made sure I knew about the Happy Hour snacks and whipped up a mean 'tini ($8).   The Happy Hour sliders were made from a very good grade of Beef.  When it came time for dinner, I stayed at the Bar and had a great meal of The Cattle Baron's 18oz Prime Rib ($36).  Tom also recommended a great Cab by the glass ($5) to go with it.  Prime Rib was done exactly how I like it, medium rare, and well seasoned with salt/pepper.  Along with the meal, starters included a nice Caesar Salad, veggies and bread. I left an 18% tip.\\n\\nThe problem which reduced this experience to two stars was that I stayed at the Bar to eat.  There were two other food servers in the bar; a lady and a man.  The lady blazed through customers walking to the bathroom with complete disregard, pushing us out of the way.  The male server came to deposit his tables' empties at center of the bar right where we sat, so that we had to stare at dirty glassware.  Each time he did so, he leaned between us and rammed his tray into my back.  I leaned as far forward over the bar that I could but each of the three times he still jabbed his tray in my back.  We were so upset that we abandoned the coupon's for free dessert that we got when signing up on their website.\\n\\nThis should never happen at any high end restaurant.  \\n\\nI look forward to returning, having another great meal but being seated in the dining area so I can upgrade this rating.\\nSee photos I've attached.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "The problem with most airports: not addressing the needs of its customers. Usually, we need to check in early that we end up waiting around for the boarding and departure. What do most travelers these days do? They use their smart phones or tablets/iPads to entertain themselves while waiting. What do most airports lack? Charging stations! \\n\\nInstead, those of us who are using these devices end up fighting over the coveted spaces that have been equipped with charging stations. I've noticed that some of the seats have outlets built in along the bottom of the chairs. Why can't more of these updated seats be added to the airports? Not everyone needs a small workspace area as I've noticed in some airports. Instead, we just need the ability to charge our devices while we entertain ourselves or work during the waiting period for our departure. Until I see an airport that does address these needs, I can't issue anything above a 3 star rating.\\n\\nAs for the facilities, it looks like they've tried to bring in more restaurants with a modern look and feel.

        "I came here to see \\\"Miracle on 34th Street\\\" with my Mom, son and my mom's friends. Wasn't sure what to expect since I've never been here. We came on a Sunday night and they open the theatre doors at 5:30 for dinner. \\n\\nDinner was a buffet. One line was for hot food. One for salad bar and one line for deserts. The hot food had mixed vegetables, cream string beans, mash potatoes and gravy, shredded Turkey in a gravy, thinly cut ham, and thinly cut prime rib. The salad bar was a normal salad bar with limited topping and a few salad dressing. The desert bar had lots of pies and different bars. I would say the ham and prime rib were dry and would recommend that you put some gravy on top. Otherwise, I would say the food is okay. Not a real favorite of mine. I would put this in the same category as Home Town Buffet which is not a compliment in my book. \\n\\nSo they gave us two hours to eat which means the show didn't start til 7:30pm. They had a pre-act with a bunch of singing and dancing which was good. I really liked the show. Nice big stage. Really good acting. Enjoyed the show. First act lasted about an hour and the second act about a half an hour. So ended a little after 9pm. \\n\\nNow would I come back. That's the million dollar question. Didn't like the food so I would probably eat something before I came again but really enjoyed the show. I guess I would come back if there was a show I was really wanted to see. The reason for the 3 star is I didn't like the food and for a Foodie like me. It's important. I would give the show a definite 4 star. So enjoy.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "I came in wanting to like this place, but I was met with some squarely bad service at the beginning of the night, and things never got better to the point that they made up for it.  Waiting close to ten minutes by the bar, with nobody in front of me, and having the bartenders listlessly walk around without doing anything, and then immediately serving someone older that comes up (before they served me) really put a damper on the rest of the experience.  \\n\\nMy group got two baked potatoes: one of the \\\"buffalo\\\" variety, one cajun style.  The buffalo one was... not very good, and skimpy on toppings.  The cajun one was really good, and generously topped with spices, sour cream, chives, etc.  The fact that these two equally priced and supposedly equivalent dishes were inconsistent causes me a bit of alarm.\\n\\nDrinks-wise, the craft beers aren't terribly expensive ($4/bottle), and the Bloody Marys (also $4) were pretty good, and rather unique in my experience.  Live music was nice, and the bar had a nice ambiance to put the focus on the music, even if it was at the expense of conversation on this particular night.\\n\\nOverall, I'd guess that this place has the potential to be good, but I just didn't see that potential get realized tonight.

        "Review text:\nlet me start by saying...any place that offers 77% off your meal, just for being born in the year 1977 is alright by me! that's right, last week was the 32nd year anniversary for the Restaurant, located around AZ, so they offered several super cheap deals on some great food! We were there on the day of the 77% discount and my seester and i ate like hogs for $12.50, of which $6.50 was my mango margarita (arriba arriba! so tasty) i had the cheese enchilada, chicken hard taco, tortilla soup and of course many a chip and salsa y creama (sour cream) the rice was delicious as always, the soup devine (the broth was made with red enchilada sauce). the chicken taco wasn't my favorite (sorry my ma makes the best) because of the ground chicken pattie type of thing that was fried in the tortilla shell. on the other hand, my sister said the chicken taco has been her favorite for the past 10 years that we've been eating there. oh yeah secrets out of the bag in this review....the salsa served here is the best hang over cure you can find in AZ, not sure why, and it might even be the chips, but they work wonders! \\n\\nso the manager said earlier in the week of the anniversary, the numero uno was the same price as the day the restaurant first opened, but we missed that day. next year they will do the same, but take my word and don't wait,  the food was still very reasonably priced for everyday meals, and the happy hour is a local secret, one that is packed with cheap tasty treats, refreshing drinks and the tastiest salsa served with light crispy chips, i could fill up on those alone (and believe me there have been many a time i have!) enjoy this rare authentic treasure hidden in a tourist mall (go figure).\\n\\nmy only complaint is the lack of room in my stomach after that free basket of chips and the delicious salsa they pushed on me- which was actually very welcomed lol.\n\nStars:",

        "Review: I've been here once and I chose Nancy, because on the site, she had the most raved reviews. I'm never coming back. We texted back and forth so I could get a feel for the price and her experience. She said she charges $35-$80 depending on the complexity of the up-do...so I chose an easy yet elegant up-do for my formal affair. I would need the trial and then again for the day of. First of all, she showed up late to the appointment; about 15min. I brought with me the photo of a non-complicated up-do. She was going extremely slow....not just \\\"taking her time.\\\" As she was chatting and rummaging around for her curling iron she kept mentioning her other services...which is fine but after I say not interested...its rude to keep pushing for it, and pushing for more. To say the least I was annoyed at this point, I came to relax and get my hair done not have a yappy salesman in my ear the whole time. She was also eating up time by starting out with putting the curling iron on the lowest setting, I could tell because when the curl hit my neck, it was barely warm! (My hair is noticeably thick and I was wearing extensions that day). She kept saying, I'll turn it up a little higher but if it doesn't work, under the heat with curlers you'll need to do. What?! I straighten my hair damn near every day without damaging or burning it...what was she up to? Then at the end of it all, I knew. When it came time to pay I asked her how much.....Well, come to find out she charges...BY THE HOUR, not by the up-do like she previously texted me. Even though she was late, even though she took her sweet ol' time, I didn't complain because I thought I was being charged for the complexity of the up-do. Even though she was late...she factored in that time too. So 2 hours. Yep, took her 2 hours and she charged me $80 for this trial! Because this up-do was so NOT complicated, my mother in law volunteered to do it for the day of and it came out way more beautiful, cost me nothing, and it took her 30 minutes! I was scammed by Nancy. I hope she...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I have been to several different locations and this on in particular is the only place it happens. So I went to purchase Grey Goose Vodka which is behind one of the registers. There is no sign on the shelf where all the other brands of Vodka are that tell you where to locate them or anything that anything showing that they even sell the brand. As I approached the register with my husband and ask for the Vodka the cashier went and got it and said to BOTH my husband and for our I.D's. When I asked why she said because you both look under 40. And then when I asked why she needed to see both our I.D's she points to a sign that says if you look under 40 and purchasing alcohol and or tobacco products. Then she says it's the store policy to ask anyone who comes in the store together that looks under 40 for everyone in that groups I.D. I said again where is that written. She say it's store policy. I ask to speak to a manager. She calls over a store lead. The lead tells me that same thing and then I say well that makes no since to me because he's my husband and I've showed you my I.D. and I'm the one who's purchasing the alcohol.  The lead says would you like to speak to and assistant manager. I said I thought your were a manager that's who I asked for. She says no I'm a lead or something of that sort. So when that assistant manager was called over he said the same thing and I asked again WHERE IS THAT WRITTEN.  As I was talking to the assistant manager the cashier unrings the bottle of vodka and puts it back on the shelf walks away from the register without saying another word and a new cashier come over. At this point I just wanted to get the hell out of there so my husband and I BOTH showed l.D.s and HE (my husband) paid for it and we left. \\n\\nI have been to other Walmarts in the area and have purchased the exact same thing.

        "Review text:\nAwesome course, nothing wrong with the golf, but cant give five stars due to my last trip.  We had friends come in from out of town and i made the reservations for 4 on the website.  easy enough, thought i was doing the right thing by booking early and reserving our spot, since it was first couple days open after re-seeding. We get to the course and there are 2 AZ residents and 2 out of towners.  When we pay the local rate was $160 and the non-local was $145.  I asked why mine was more and he said it was because i made reservations too far in advance?  Their backwards approach is that if you make reservations 8 days or more out, non-locals pay less and locals pay more... if its 7 days and in, locals pay less and non-locals pay more. and it is a difference of $70 for locals! ($90 vs $160)  So i asked him how this works, and he said, with a straight face... \\\"what you have to do is make a reservation for 2 for non-locals in advance, then wait a couple days and add the 2 locals later.\\\"  I looked at him and said \\\"do you realize what you just said there?\\\"  he said, \\\"yep that's how we do it.\\\"  I don't see how you can say this to someone without laughing and saying, \\\"yeah, it doesn't make sense but we got ya bitch!\\\" So the 2 locals had to pay an extra $70 each because we wanted to make a tee time in advance for 4 people.

        "Review text:\nI have a son and a daughter who have attended Community Montessori School for the last 14 months. It is a one room school house with 4 teachers and less than 30 children. There is a teacher for the outside activities, and 3 that stay inside. The school is clean and orderly. The children eat a home packed lunch outside (weather permitting) provided by the parent. There is an emphasis on proper nutrition and appropriate lessons given on this topic. Parents are expected to donate  fresh fruit/veggies/ juice/etc,  and if your still naps, you will be given school laundry duty approx every 6 weeks.  The tuition for the private school is a little higher than other private schools in the area once all the extra fees are factored in. The reason for the low rating is because of the issues my family encountered due to the head teacher authoritative attitude and inflexible demeanor. There are two very good teachers (Jocelyn and Helen) at this school, however the attitude of the boss typically sets the tone and environment of any workplace and that is absolutely the case for this one room school house. \\n \\nThe school is academically strong. My children learned a lot at their time at the school.  They often came home talking about their day, their friends, and the new lessons they learned. I also made it a point to reach out to the teachers and ask how the kids were doing frequently. We always received feedback. When there were struggles the teachers were always willing to discuss and provide alternatives.  My experience was, as long as we took the advice from the head teacher, then things were ok, but if we did not conform, then it was her way or the highway -  there was no flexibility.  For example, after a particularly difficult couple of weeks, when my  children were struggling with proper behavior, the head teacher thought it best to have my son hold her pocket for the entire afternoon. He had to literally hold her pocket,  and could only go where she went, except for bathroom breaks. At this point my son shut down...\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nThey are HORRIBLE, AWFUL business people and I am officially boycotting them and here's why....a friend of mine, her 1 yr old son and I paid a visit to thier shop a while back and I purchased several items totalling more than $250 and when we were done, we walked next door to have lunch at Zoe's. We thought nothing of it as we had patronized thier establishment and were the ONLY 2 customers and the only 2 cars in the parking lot. That's it! Plenty of other spaces! Not even halfway through our meal the owner of Easley's shop came over and told us we need to move our vehicles. Confused and annoyed by this, I asked why and he said \\\"because you can't just leave your car here and go somewhere else.\\\" When I reminded him that I had just patronized his business and spent over $250 and that there were NO other cars in the parking lot, he responded very rudely with \\\"I don't care! Get your vehicles off my property!\\\"\\nAt which point I informed him that his sign stated \\\"Parking for Easley's customers only\\\" and that I was, in fact, an Easley's customer & showed him my receipt. After spending $250 on THAT trip alone, I was not about to move my car 18 feet. And there were NO other customers in his parking lot!!! So as we were finishing our lunch somebody else comes over and tells us that they are calling the police on us and they're going to tow our cars. Meanwhile my friend's young son needed his diaper changed so as I'm explaining to this cantankerous old man how we have done NO harm, spent a lot of money in HIS shop and that we were the ONLY customers he had in the whole 90 minutes we had been there AND had lunch, she (my friend) decides to change her son in the back of the truck. keep in mind it's July, HOT as hell outside and as the one-year-old is crying & fussing and his mother is struggling to change his diaper, this old man, and now 2 other employees, decide to come yelling and threatening us \\\"Get the %#$ off my property! I'm calling the police! You're going to get arrested!\\\"\\nTotally, utterly, absolutely...\n\nStars:",

        "This restaurant will find no shortage of rave reviews.  They know most people come here to celebrate a special occasion.  The beautiful Pittsburgh skyline at night, is an amazing backdrop for dinner.  And the staff is excellent in complementing the evening with friendly service.\\n\\nThe $70/per chef's tasting was pretty good.  Each selection, apps, fish, meat, and desert have 3 choices, so if you're with another person, you'll likely get 2 out of 3 dishes offered.  Some of the flavor profiles were pretty great, but a tad salty for our tastes.  One of our fish dishes was the Cobia, and we sent it back because we thought it was still frozen.  We're not sure - we were told it was cooked to medium-rare, but we couldn't even cut through the fish - and it was ice cold in the middle.  So I still don't know if it wasn't cooked right, or we just don't know how to eat Cobia.  \\n\\nSome other hiccups in the service, included the wrong glass of wine, and actually the wrong meat course.  I had ordered the lamb but got the short rib.  I didn't say anything about the short rib, because, c'mon, who doesn't love short rib? Regardless, that many mistakes from such a high-end restaurant is surprising and disappointing.\\n\\nWe still had a very pleasant experience, but I think felt a little wanting for more of a wow factor from the food.  \\n\\n------------\\nAppetizer - Choice of One\\nScallops - Nantucket Bay Scallops, Diver Sea Scallop, Cauliflower, Breadcrumbs\\nParsnip, Leek & Ginger Soup - Toasted Pepitas, Pumpkin Oil\\nRicotta Ravioli - Hedgehog mushrooms, Black Truffle, Hickory Smoked Chanterelle Puree\\n\\nFish Course - Choice of One\\nNorth Atlantic Lobster - Melted Leeks, Red Beets, Mascarpone Risotto\\nCobia - Kale, Shiso, Pickled Ginger, White Soy & Yuzu Ponzu \\nBass - Roasted Brussels sprouts, Golden Beet, Agro Dulche Buerre Blanc \\n\\nIntermezzo - Chef's Daily Sorbet Selection \\n\\nMeat Course - Choice of One\\nVenison Rack Chop - Black Pepper Crust, Spelt Berries, Persimmon, Roasted Fennel\\nNY Strip Steak - Salsify, Celeriac...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "This was, unfortunately, a disappointment.\\n\\nI think the key to art museums is that they don't have to have super famous works of art, but they should carry pieces that have significance. I realize this can be very subjective, but I've found amazing experiences and hidden gems in places like Kansas City and St. Louis. I was surprised by the Phoenix Art Museum.\\n\\nThe price is a bit high for admission, but I really like that they allow you to apply your funds for one visit to a membership if you'd like. It's big, clean, and well staffed, but parking can be an issue.\\n\\nThe pieces of work... hm. I think part of the issue is that Arizona is a relatively new state, and the art museum is just over 50 years old. My impression is that this art museum has not had the time to collect varied, interesting pieces to exhibit. I did also find the Asian art section small and disappointing.\\n\\nThat being said, I thought the Phillip C. Curtis exhibit was wonderful. He was a local artist from Arizona and his work is really interesting, especially the commentary on social class in Arizona and the town of Jerome. I think I spent most of my time looking at his work. This is definitely the highlight of the museum.\\n\\nI really hope with more time that the Phoenix Art Museum will grow, but as of now, I think one visit was enough for me.

        "One would think living so close to Mexico that allll the Mexican food would be good. WRONG!  DO NOT GO HERE!!!\\n\\n My friend and I ordered 2 Cabo Wabo Margaritas.  The first round was decent but the 2nd round tasted like a nasty $2 house mix.  I brought it to the waiter's attention that there was a large stash of salt at the bottom of my drink.  Which I found odd that there was zero salt on the rim.  He took the drink back and sure enough attempt #2 was yellow, tasted like a mix and once again had a large pile of salt on the bottom with none on the rim.  In speaking again to the waiter he assured me that it would be right the 3rd time and it was a learning lesson for the bartender since they were new.  I stated that it was fine and I really didn't want the drink.  He then brings back the same thing.  My friends drink was just as bad.\\n\\nThe highlight was that when getting our bill all drinks were left on the bill.  My full $10 nasty drink was left, in which was wrong and I didn't want.\\n\\nI will never return to this restaurant, not that it was my pick in the first place.  It is overpriced for what you get with bad service that does not care about the customer.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: Do absolutely everything you can to live anywhere else but here. It's a racket where they lock you in requiring a 60-day notice to cancel BUT NOT FROM THE DATE YOU CANCEL. It's to the next month so they're basically sucking you in for 3 months rent then charge you a month termination fee (because they never show you the models on the floors you'll deal with and the terrible conditions you deal with). It's 30 days anywhere else. Just a short list of the problems:\\n\\n-There are people that literally just squat in other peoples' apartments (I'm talking at least 12 to an apartment) who come and go and slam the doors all day and night.\\n\\n-You can't take the stairs instead of the elevators and there aren't enough elevators to accommodate the demand, so you'll be stuck standing and waiting to get anywhere for a very long time.\\n\\n-Whatever people are cooking (and smoking) in their apartments permeates the air in the hall and gets into your apartment.\\n\\n-If it's not the road construction that wakes you up and serves as your background noise, it's the work going on in the building at any given moment\\n\\n-A lot of the doormen are just incredibly rude\\n\\n-Prepare to get really uncomfortable as the multitude of ethnicities gawk and stare at you while they carry potent-smelling foods to various floors on the elevators...barefoot.\\n\\n-If you have a dog, also prepare to have other people make you wait for another elevator because they're scared (including maintenance staff).\\n\\n-The trash chute also permeates the hall with its distinctive smell of rotting strawberries, all the time\\n\\n-Really bad insulation on the windows\\n\\n-The 2 leasing agents gave me a hard time for ACTUALLY reading my lease when I said and told me they would send a copy. It's been 6 months and they still haven't and I'm still waiting on a copy after my 3rd request.\\n\\n-Don't expect anyone to get back to you with an expediency\\n\\n-It's an overpriced geriatric facility and/or dormitory. It can be quite confusing.\\n\\n-The only option for guest parking...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: WARNING. DO NOT GO HERE.\\n\\nMy family was visiting my sister in Pittsburgh and we had our eyes set on a specific restaurant, not Christos. A gentleman, I presume the owner of Christos, saw my family and I as we walked down the street. He flashed us his menu, pitching to us why his restaurant was the best and why his food was the best. I could barely tell if he was selling food or used cars. I kindly told him we were not interested. My family, however, was indecisive when it came to getting a restaurant. We ending up wanting to go eat at the restaurant next door to Christos so we backtracked. Again the owner flashed us his menu, sensing our touristy indecision. I again declined and pointed to the restaurant I was heading to. He then ignored me and pan-handled to my two sisters, mother and wife. They gave in to my dismay. As they said \\\"sure...\\\" I looked inside the restaurant of Christos at peak dinner hours.  No one was inside.  Absolutely no one. As my family walked in and I rolled my eyes, I thought, well let's give them a chance...my whole family seemed to feel bad for the guy and I like Greek food.\\n\\nAs we got in, it seemed nothing was going on. We had just came back from kayaking so we needed to wash our hands. They didn't seem to have a restroom but they took my sisters and mother through the kitchen and downstairs to find one. The silence was broken when they finally put music on and suddenly a couple of kitchen helpers came out and looked like they were warming some of the kitchen equipment up.  Were we their only customers tonight? I bet we were. Before I could settle in, he casually asked if I liked pita and hummus. Obviously I said yes. He was asking me so casually when I didn't even have a menu, I assumed it was complimentary when he said he would get me some, but as I waited I found his restaurant on Yelp with my phone and the first review gave them one star and mentioned how the owner didn't tell him the pita was extra.

I ordered the Caesar, and it was very good, but I would only eat small amount so as not to ruin my meal. Guess what?  It was an a la carte item I would not have ordered..it was an additional. '$12.

In making the reservation, he had casually mentioned this. \\n\\nWe show up to the restaurant, and first of all, I was really blown away with where this place is located. It has a beautiful view overlooking Phoenix and it's tucked away in a mountain side or something. \\n\\nThe hostess was incredibly sweet and greeted us and for some weird reason knew who we were right when we walked in. We were sat right away and everyone who came to our table were charming and polite. \\n\\nWe started with the butternut squash ravioli, seared scallops, and the lobster bisque. Oh my goodness. I can't even begin to explain, there was such complexity in the flavors, it was very good. \\n\\nMy boyfriend got the Artichoke pesto chicken and I got the trout. Again, I cannot begin to explain how delicious our meal was. The flavors all melded so well together. My dish came with mushrooms and I completely cleaned my plate. I despise mushrooms! But these were really something else. We skipped dessert, but the table next to us as we were leaving made us regret that decision because it looked incredible. The bill was pretty up there, but, what is to be expected from a place like this? The view, service and food; it all somewhat felt worth it to me.\\n\\nUpon leaving, the hostess not only remembered who we were but also told us to have a great time at the show. I know it's her job as a hostess to be inviting, but I feel that's something that takes a little more effort to do, and it was greatly appreciated and really made the dinner feel that much better. \\n\\nThis is a wonderful date night restaurant. My boyfriend and I both agreed if we ever find ourselves in Phoenix again, we will definitely come back to this place.\n\nReview rating:",

We started at the west entrance because we wanted to leave the aquarium and \\\"wet\\\" experience towards the end.  There are several stations where you can feed animals.  Make sure you get change at the gate ( you need quarters for the machines).  I didn't mind that everything is pretty much \\\"a la carte\\\".  The skyride is $4 per person.  It is worth every penny.  It was so much fun to ride above the zoo and observe the animals.  So beautiful.  The train ride was also $4 per person.  The carousel was $2.50 a person and feeding the rays was $3, which my little boy had a thrill.  He couldn't stop laughing whenever the rays touched his little fingers.  I got to touch them too, they are funky in a cool kind of way.  The only one that we thought was a little steep was the Log Flume ride, at $6 a person, we decided it was not worth it. The kids had a blast at the petting zoo, they still talk about it even a week after being there.  Another thing that was great was having a real restaurant available inside the zoo.  They have a Dillon's in there by the stingray station. We spent 6 hours there and we couldn't believe we missed the penguins.  I guess we will have to go back.  We all agreed, we couldn't find a reason to go to the Phoenix zoo anymore.\n\nStars:",

Bobby declined for a month every time i offered since it's easier to just grab breakfast in Oakland or downtown. \\n\\nI've become a little non-existent on yelp lately due to my urge to learn to cook (& cook well!) I've been making dinner at home and packing my lunch daily, so breakfast at Barbs last Saturday (which was also our 2-year special date) was our first time eating out in a good month. \\n\\nI ordered the traditional breakfast; 3 eggs, home fries, choice of meat & toast. Bobby ordered the kitchen sink after I informed him that many people on yelp recommended that option. He was satisfied and I think its pretty awesome you get to choose the 3 meats in your kitchen sink omelet. \\n\\nSpeaking of that, when I asked if they had sausage patties i was surprised to hear yes but even more happy that they had 3 different options in the sausage patty category (score!) \\n\\nThere were a few mishaps but we never mentioned them to server because the food was still delicious. (minor mishaps.. wrong sausage, no onions/peppers on home fries after requested & never given an option on toast. we were just brought out Italian) None of these were too big of a deal, but I thought there should be a reason behind my rating... Im sure any of the workers would have bent over backwards to fix the issue if we had brought it up. Everyone was friendly! \\n\\nWe'll be back and I'm sure next time it'll be even better.

This is a place for people to go, when they want a really nice atmosphere, with decent service, but don't really care about  quality food. For the prices, $100 to feed my family (2 adult meals, 1 app, 4 kids meals and 6 soft drinks, no alcohol, no dessert), the food should have been much, much better. Every thing taste pre-made, like out of a can or jar, not pre-made at the restaurant. It wasn't bad food, just way over priced for low end average.

By this time, there were 8 or 9 of us waiting...it was a hot mess in there.\\n\\nI went for the Carne Asada Burrito first.  I took one bite and didn't like it...it was way too salty.  The Burrito was all Meat & a little Guac/Salsa combo...no Rice or Beans...that's a common recipe in some of these Taco shops.  Since there wasn't any other ingredients to soften the salty flavor, it was just bad.\\n\\nNext, I went for the Beans/Rice/Cheese (BRC) Burrito.  I took one bite and that one was bland.  I don't know if my taste buds were shot from the salty Carne Asada Burrito, but it wasn't good either.\\n\\nThe Salsa wasn't *meh* too and couldn't save it for me.

        "Best kept secret in off-strip Vegas! Small, hole-in-the-wall place for down-home grub. Had the NY steak and petite lobster tail special ($9.99). To the person who whined about the size of the lobster: it's PETITE, that means small. They are a different species than the red monstrosities  you see in high-end restaurants. They also tend to be sweeter and more tender. These were exactly the size I was expecting - and were cooked to perfection. Tender and juicy - not rubbery at all. Yum! The steak was decent, though not great, but still better than what I was expecting for under ten bucks.\\n\\nYes, the roll was giant. I'm not big roll fan, but it was good, I guess.\\n\\nJim had one of their skillets (some kind of omelet with chili on it), and from the sight of nothing but a spinning fork left over, I deduce that he quite enjoyed his meal, too.\\n\\nService was just fine. Yes, we had to wait for a table - but you have to do that at hoity toity places, too. This is a very small, very busy joint. Our drinks were always full, our order taken right away, and our food brought out nice and hot.\nSo I would like to give it",

Had an OK crowd inside. On the menu Board, it says \\\"try it, you'll love it\\\" So i did. I paid almost $7.00 for my steak sandwich. It didn't take that long to cook. (that part I was impressed.) When I got my sandwich, it was a skinny little thing. I took my first bite & the sweet peppers were cold. I usually like to eat the whole sandwich, but I had to leave pieces of bread behind because they were, just that, bread!\\n\\nI've had steak sandwiches before (in philly) & they are soooo good.

The Ethiopian Coffee came in a french press, so you could probably get 2-3 cups out this one. The Kijafa Crepes came with 3 large crepes covered in cherries and this awesome sauce.  Each crepe itself could have been its own serving. \\n\\nBut I do have to remember that this is the South...so therefore everything comes in extra large.  I wish I was able eat all of it, but the my body will reject the greasy fatty goodness.  So the one crepe that I was able to eat was yum-tastic.\n\nReview rating:",

A friend invited yesterday for lunch,so we jammed on our cruisers..well, you know the parking and it was a beautiful day yesterday. I was so craving the tuna melt sandwich have been salivating about it for months..months I tell you. I order from a chipper little gal...I asked if I could have it open faced. She didn't think it would be a problem...wrong answer! The kitchen obviously has never made an open faced before..oh yes they have and use to get it right..guess the new peeps from down south didn't get the how to memo. \\nThe 1st time it came out with two slices of bread with a square of slightly melted cheddar laying there flat with a huge dollop of cold tuna on top...Really?? I took it back..a different girl said what's wrong with that? Apparently everything you nit wit! So, they remade it, check my photo..this is what I got back..except I added the zig zag of color just so I could choke it down. The \\\"manager type\\\" person actually handed this to me and said, \\\"your remake\\\" Really? But I was so hungry and frustrated, I took it..not even any fruit..so for $7.50 I got a plate of tuna poop. 3 bites later, it hit the trash receptacle. Don't ever expect anyone there to step up to the plate and offer you a refund or a do over..cuz it just ain't happening right. I was here a couple of months ago, ordered potato leek soup, came out curdled and cold..an employee walking by my table said, \\\"wow that doesn't look right, gross\\\" wouldn't take it off the bill and was like, \\\"glad I'm not eating it\\\". And I'm glad I'm not eating here anymore and that Bertha's and Acacia Cafe have moved into the neighborhood. The people watching may not be the same, but the food is great, service outstanding and even better prices. What a shame!\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nI recently got my little baby pug Penny from a private breeder, so I wanted to take her to a vet and get her checked out. Animal Care Hospital was close to my house, so I figured I would give it a try. \\n\\nThey were able to see me SAME DAY, which was an awesome treat. I was afraid I would have to wait several days for my new puppy exam and the medical guarantee from the breeder was only good for one week.\\n\\nAnyways, the vets office was conveniently located, the office is clean, the staff is friendly and everyone was in love with Penny. (it's hard not to be.. I know I am a proud mommy, but she really is adorable!)\\n\\nI sat down and filled out my paperwork and they took me back right away. The vet, Dr. Temple, was extremely friendly and thorough and answered all my questions. I signed up for the \\\"puppy package\\\" that basically takes you through all of the shots they need for the first few months, wellness exams, fecal test and a microchip and also includes a start up of heartworm preventer.\\n\\nPenny had her second set of shots the day prior when I purchased her from the breeder, but for some reason Dr. Temple gave her another set. She told me there was nothing to worry about but they didn't charge me, so I think she may have made a mistake. Penny was fine and she told me that it would not cause any problems, but I'm glad that she didn't make a mistake on something life threatening. (This is the only reason I am not giving ACHS five stars.)\\n\\nWe went back three weeks later for our third set of shots and got in immediately. They were quick, friendly and efficient again and able to provide me with some suggestions on how to curb Miss Penny's biting habits.\\n\\nThe only issues I have encountered were with the billing. I think that the puppy package confuses the billing girls a little, because both times I went in they had to make adjustments. Not a big deal, they took care of everything and refunded the incorrect amount immediately, I just hope it doesn't keep happening.\\n\\nOh, another really cool feature is that...\n\nReview rating:",

We called Home Depot to set up an appointment and the Home Depot advised that we needed to pay a fee to have the house measured. We set that up and paid the fee to get the area measured. We requested a quote for wood and tile, tile in the entry and kitchen and wood in the family room. We decided to do this and move forward with the flooring. Home Depot required 100% payment upfront. After about 5 weeks the day of the install comes.....6 hours late the installer tears out 50% of my old tile and informs us the measurements are wrong and we needed to pay additional for extra supplies and installation. We called Home Depot and complained, they said that they will take care of the extra installation for the portion that was not measured by them but we need to pay for the extra supplies. Home Depot told us that if we did not agree they would stop the work that I already paid 100% of and not take care of the extra installation that they missed leaving my house torn apart. The extra cost of the job is $400 on a $5,000 job and this is crazy!! We pay to have an area measured to get a job done that ends up being measured wrong and without any other option we get stuck with extra charges.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Yes, Cabo Fish Taco seems to be like a mecca for the throngs of people standing on the street corner waiting to get in on a gallery crawl Friday night in NoDa.  And Guy Fieri stopped by to film his Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives show for food network there.  And it is known to be a favorite of NASCAR driver, Kasey Kahne.  But it is also just plain old solid food.\\n\\nThe owners finally knocked out the wall and expanded into the adjacent space after years of slowly doing the construction themselves and it was worth the wait.  They did a fine job adding the nicely finished surfboard bar as well as a refreshing street side outdoor dining area.  If you close your eyes you can imagine that the cars driving by are the sound of waves crashing... alright maybe not...\\n\\nThe fish tacos are obviously good.  The barbecue mahi mahi is insanely tasty.  Personally, I stick with the shrimp tacos when I am going the taco route.  And that is only because there was a lot of inconsistency with the steak tacos.  Sometimes extremely oversalted.\\n\\nThe wraps are also good as I am a fan of the Southwest Chicken wrap.  The combination of just enough spicy with the cooling cucumbers is the key.\\n\\nFor heavier fare, the Surf and Turf Pasta is good.  Plenty of shrimp and steak with bowtie pasta.  Although, it would be easier to eat if they finished prepping the shrimp by taking off the tails.  Sometimes, you just don't feel like eating with your fingers.\\n\\nThe margarita menu is expansive and good.  When the mood hits me, the Silver Surfer satisfies.  Otherwise, they have a solid beer selection to choose from.\\n\\nYes, the chips are usually cold, and the corn in the free salsa is canned.  But if you throw in a side of queso, it will curb the appetite that you built up while waiting on the street... My rating for this place is",

        "Review text:\nAfter driving around Vegas a little bit, I passed by the Howard Johnsons on Las Vegas Blvd and against my friend's better judgment, we tried out a little Cuban restaurant attached to the hotel: Florida Cafe.\\n\\nExcellent little place. Well, excellent if you're not vegetarian. While my friend indulged in the one vegetarian entree, I had the chicken over rice with pimentos and peppers. Pretty sure it wasn't the healthiest meal in Vegas, but the taste of the fried yellow rice was enough to put the restaurant on my permanent list. And while the rice was stealing the show, the chicken (I think it was roasted) fell off the bone when I pulled at it with my fork and produced a simple and yet flavorful combination.\\n\\nCuban food, at least as done by Florida Cafe, is sweet and slightly spicy, but with a totally separate spice that other Latin or Caribbean food. It doesn't overpower like jerk (Jamaican) or feel dusted in cumin (Latin). Instead, it offers a subtle sweetness mixed with a slight spice.\\n\\nWhile I'd heard a recommendation from someone at work, I wasn't expecting much since the restaurant was attached to a HoJos. I think the best way of explaining how good the place was is to tell that they screwed up my first drink order and served me Jack Daniels instead of Jim Beam. And I still have not a bad word to say (about the food--service is a totally different story and not what I talk about here).\n\nStars:",

        "Review: I bought a sofa yesterday - but it wasn't from Pruitts.  I do thank them for having a large selection and being the only store I went to that had a sofa I wanted though.  Helped me to be able to find it online, shipped to my door for less than their price.\\n\\nThat said, if one of the seemingly 10,000 sales people there would have shown even the slightest interest in making the sale, I would have bought it there and been done.\\n\\nInstead we walked about 30% of the way through the first floor without anyone saying a word.  I stopped and asked a sales lady (and I am 110% positive she worked there as she was JUST helping someone else) if upstairs was more sofas.  She ignored me.  Flat out ignored.  Thinking perhaps she didn't hear, my husband said something to her about being too busy to acknowledge, and STILL she ignored us.  So we wandered up there on our own.\\n\\nAbout 80% of the way though the store, and after making eye contact with at least a dozen other sales people and smiling as I normally do, one finally decided to ask if we needed any help.  I said we were looking for small love-seats.  He pointed us to the direction of the entrance, where we had been, and said that was it.\\n\\nWell, so we went back to the entrance to the one sofa I initially saw and liked.   I was sitting on it, laying on it, taking pictures to send to a designer friend, measuring, etc in the same room about 10 feet away from FOUR sales men and not a single one asked if we needed help, had questions, etc.\\n\\nThere was also I rug I was keen on, except for the colors.  This was Hubby's conversation with the sales man closest to him:\\nHubby: Hey, do you work here?\\nSales Guy:  Yes\\nH:  I have a question about this rug\\nS:  Oh, we work in rooms.  I don't work in this room.  I don't know anything about it\\nH:  OK, so you can't help me then?\\nS:  Nope. \\nAnd he walked away.  No offer of getting someone to help, or asking what the question was, NOTHING.\\n\\nSo - we walked out.

        "My experience here wasn't as great as I thought it would be based on the number of average stars Food Express has for the number of reviews.  We had a language problem a couple of times last night.\\n\\nI ordered the moo shu pork for an appetizer for the two of us and chicken with green beans for a main course, also to be shared.  The moo shu was brought out in a relatively quick time.  There were four plump pancakes filled with goodness.  It appears that Food Express used the tortilla like wrappers instead of the thinner, traditional pancakes.  The rolls were flavorful but before we even had one eaten, the server was back with our main course.  I hate that so much.\\n\\nWhen the chicken arrived, it was not chicken with green beans but chicken with broccoli.  That was a language problem or simply an error on the server's part.  We took the meal.  I wouldn't waste that food for one vegetable.\\n\\nWhen we were finished, I asked if there was a dessert menu.  The server mumbled something, pointed to the kitchen, and then left the table.  A few minutes later, he came back with two small bowls of warmed, sweetened red bean soup which was our dessert I guess but he never said anything more.\\n\\nMy wife didn't care for her dessert so I finished two.  I'm glad it was small.\\n\\nThere are many things on the menu I'd love to try but I'm a little gun shy.  I'm not sure I'll be back.

Family owned - mamma is in the upstairs and Jr. waits tables - all food seems hand made, which means the pasta is fresh and the red sauce is yummy. The best thing on the menu is the eggplant in all forms. Meatballs and sausage are second rate, though. Grisly is the word that comes to mind. Stuffed mushrooms too bready. But the greens and beans are good and the dumpling soup is authentic with delish homemade broth and dumpling - ask to make sure it is cooked through to avoid it being sticky in the middle. Excellent chicken parmesan. The bottled beer list is good but pricey, as is the wine. So split an appetizer and a pasta dish and have just one glass of red and all will be well.

Could have used a little salt and pepper - neither to be found.  The pork was tasty - definitely smokey.  The side of sauce made it, however.  Sweet, tangy, spicy.  While I was eating it, I thought \\\"yeah, it's okay - but I wouldn't rave about it\\\".  Later, however, thinking back on the meal, I thought, \\\"you know, that was REALLY good!\\\"\\n\\nWhile it doesn't best the BBQ I've had in Memphis, it certainly cuts itself from the same cloth. I'd have it again.  I think my meal was around $9 (no drink - had a water).  I was full, and content.  Mission accomplished!\\n\\nMy coworker had some ribs, and they looked very good - not too fatty, cooked well.  I would like to go back and try them sometime!\\n\\nTip:  Limited seating, so show up early (or late!)\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "First, let me start off by saying that  usually I try to stay out of anything that I feel should have a \\\"Super\\\" in front of their title (ex. Super Walmart...Super Target), but this Walmart is close to my house so for convenience I visit it on a regular.  This Walmart actually closes at 11PM...I know right I couldn't believe it also b/c I'm so used to Walmart staying open 24HRS a day.  They have a few aisles that's set up for groceries but that too is not extensive.  There is no produce (tomatoes, lettuce, etc.) here.\\nI  found that items here are way overpriced if you should go to a Super Walmart.  For example, gel inserts for your shoes are almost $20 here when you can get some at the Super Walmart for about $8 - $12 (exact same brand).\\nAs with any Walmart they usually have one or two lanes open when it's the busiest time of the day (don't look for this to change).\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Okay, I might have been a tad harsh after several bad experiences two years ago!  \\n\\nOne of their waitresses moved back to Europe, and things kind of went down hill for a while. We have been back to this location several times and the service has been improving.  Today is a good example.  I came by for a Baker's Dozen around noon time. It was a madhouse! Folks standing everywhere waiting to be seated. \\n\\nBut, I was in and out within ten minutes or so.  David was directing traffic from behind the counter and doing a very good job.  BTW, it was only $9.42 for those thirteen bagels/ bialys!  So, so much better than the ones at Fry's and almost as good as New York Bagels 'N Bialys.\\n\\nThe major drawback continues to be their slower period around dinner time.  Like I said it's getting better. I guess if you've been on your feet for 5/6 hours and things slow down; you look for an opportunity to catch your breath.  \\n\\nThe food is very good, lets say Four Stars.  Service is Three Stars-ish.  And that New York kvetching?  Priceless!\\n\\nEnjoy!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nMy husband and I checked the place out for the first time on a First Friday (http://www.artlinkphoenix.com/alp/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=27) and were really impressed by the setup - the house right on the corner has a huge circular bar in front of it and the house on the left is the actual restaurant (with 4-5 tables in front for outdoor dining). The outdoor area was filled with people sipping drinks and waiting to be seated and the vibe felt really hip and urban, just like the artwalk taking place in the surrounding streets. \\n\\nThere was a wait for a table, so we put our name down. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the hostess isn't particularly warm and is actually a bit snippy. I don't think it makes the place seem more desirable if the staff is aloof and plays hard to get, but hey, maybe some people fall for that. We then walked over to get a drink at the bar. I tried the Pad Thai martini (a mix of lemongrass and basil, I think it was). It was strong, for sure, but for $12, I expected a slightly larger portion. The flavor was also really strong (very herbal) and not particularly tasty. \\n\\nWe were seated inside after about 20 minutes of waiting, which wasn't too bad given how busy the area was for First Friday. Unfortunately, however, we were seated at this high, communal table - across from each other, but sandwiched (literally) between two other parties. We didn't necessarily have a problem with this arrangement, but what did piss us off was how *ridiculously* uncomfortable the bar stools were. They were made out of this hard metal criss-cross material and literally dug into the backs of our thighs. My husband commented that they should have sat on them before they decided they would make sense for seating during a meal. On a positive note, the inside was decorated in this really cool urban-loft style and being so close to the kitchen created a really homey feel (although on this 110-degree night, we couldn't \\\"stand the heat\\\" but couldn't really \\\"get out of\\\" or...\n\nStars:",

        "Review: So, I grew up a 35mm junkie and gradually had to work myself up to a digital SLR. Though I lament the fact that I can't sustain a hobby of shooting 35mm or medium format film and developing anymore, it's nice that Biggs is in town with plenty of supplies. I've been a customer for a few years now and have always been pleased with the selection of gear, resources and used/rental equipment. \\n\\nThey've got all of the necessaries for Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Sony, and other brand loyalists. I'm a Canon guy and have always been able to find what I'm in the market for. I most recently found a lens hood for my 50mm 1.4 that was pretty hard to track down even on the internet. Also, recently sold an old Pentax K1000 and some old darkroom gear here. For the shape that some of it was in, I got a pretty good deal. \\n\\nWhere I think Biggs has some serious shortcomings is their customer service. Here's the deal, if you're not a professional photographer, (I personally am not. Just a hobby I've had for years) then you don't need to be condescending. I've had a few instances where a few of the staff members seemed to act a little more than inconvenienced to work with me. Not that it's a huge deal, but when I'm interested in checking out a lens from behind the counter, I don't need to hear a diatribe on WHY I shouldn't purchase that particular lens. It's what I'm in the market for. I do Just a bit of a flaw for the hobbyists on the customer service side of the coin. \\n\\nIn a pinch, these guys have always come through. Glad to have em in town. Clean up the attitude a bit and I think it'll spit-shine up to 4 stars no problem!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Public libraries are awesome and this one is no exception. There are thousands of books, plus magazines, video, audio and even tools (did you know you can check out tools?) all for free. There are plenty of places to sit, tables if you're trying to get work done, and computers for public use. There's also a big meeting room where they hold a nice variety of interesting events. There are several themed book displays around the library, which is nice when I wander in just looking for something, anything, to read. I think my favorite feature, though, is the hold service: you can request any item from any library in roughly half of the state, and it will be delivered to this library in short order. I know, it's a common library service these days, but have you ever stopped to think about how amazingly helpful it really is? And for free!\\n\\nMy only disappointment is that the circulation desk staff are pretty consistently unfriendly. Rarely rude, never incompetent, just very few smiles and no unnecessary words.

Got the email stating the pizza would be here in 30-40 minutes. After 55 minutes, we called and were told it is an hour for delivery as they have only 1 driver.  Okay, but shouldn't your confirmation email state that?  I understand you get busy, I can accept that.  \\n\\nOur pizza arrives 15 minutes later. We pay for it and tip the driver in cash because from what we've heard from the store, its not his fault he's the only driver tonight.  Maybe someone called in sick, again not my problem but I understand. \\n\\nPizza was cold and the order was incorrect, they gave us black olives for mushrooms. We checked the email and they screwed up, no black olives on our order.  So we called back and spoke to someone who told us the manager was too busy to talk to us now. No give me your contact info and I will have him or her call you back, nothing.  \\n\\nSo we contacted their corporate office on line. We got a response back pretty quickly apologizing for our experience and stating the store would be contacting us soon to resolve the issue.  Canned email for sure, but a response none the less. \\n\\nIt's been a week, we have heard nothing from this store. I guess they are still too busy to care.

        "i took my son here after he pleaded that after seeing the commercials about the new stuff on the menu...we had to give them another try. On previous visits the service was so bad we never wanted to come back. On this visit the service was much better and the food was typical, nothing to make me want to return. The biggest issue though was how dirty the place was. The menus we were served were filthy and the hostess kept wiping down tables with a rag she kept at the front. The rag was not rinsed out between tables and I thought it was pretty gross. Our plates were dirty on the bottom and the glasses looked dingy.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I couldn't find it from the actual review page! \\n\\nHere is the review I posted on June 13th, 2011:\\n\\nDear Caf\\u00e9 Luna,\\n\\n    You had ruined my graduation dinner on May 14th, 2011.  There are so far about, let's say, 2,000 restaurants I had visited throughout my lifetime across the globe.  I had experienced from no service at all to service styles that would leave someone feel so much like a prince or princess.  The restaurants also vary from home dinning to where President Obama and other diplomats would dine at.  None of them, even for the ones provide no service at all, had left me with such a horrific memory.  I had made a reservation at 8p.m. to celebrate the night with my family and friends who came all the way to this seemingly middle of nowhere.  We had arrived a little bit early, waited for at least 10 minutes, asked the others who were waiting, and then been informed that they all had been waiting for at least 30minutes.  One customer told us to find the host wearing white with an apron.  We waited for another 10 minutes to finally found him, then been informed by him that we would have to wait until there is an empty seat.  As a recent grad expecting an exciting and enjoyable dinner, I started to fume up with anger.  Then finally after another 15 minutes, we were being seated.  However, this nightmare did not end then.  We were sitting there for yet another 20 minutes to be finally served with water (and that's after we asked for it).  The server served the water to people next to us who were there later than us first.  Again, the server had our neighbors ordered first before we were allowed to order.  And, we were finally allowed to order after 35 minutes of sitting!  Neither the server, nor the host, was attentive and helpful.  The server had this terrible attitude toward us the whole time.  There was also no water being refilled (unlike our neighbor), so we had to head to the bar to get water ourselves. ...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

When I went to talk to the office manager Kristie about updating to a two bedroom apartment she said pitbulls aren't allowed. I tried talking to her but she like ether we get rid of her or I have to move. When I asked her about our neighbors having pitbulls she was like they will be caught.

        "I originally took my lawn mower there for what I thought would be a warranty repair. I was pleased with the repair even though it wasnt under warranty and I had to pay to the tune of $90 out the door. \\n\\nA little over a month later, my mower malfunctioned. I called the store thinking someone could help me and I got Mrs. Ayers. She claims that she is the owner of the store and her customer service skills are non-existent. This interaction was mild but I could immediately tell that she was volatile. She told me that due to the fact of the mower sitting for a month since its last use, condensation had built up in the gas tank and water had diluted the gas causing the malfunction. I was prompted to always keep the tank full. \\n\\nI wasnt informed of this when I picked up the mower from the initial repair. I called around as this seemed like sketchy advice. Four other reputable shops informed me that this couldnt be the case due to thermodynamics. The average low temp in Las Vegas over the last four weeks was in the high 50's and the dewpoint was in the mid 30's. In order to get condensation, the gas or ambient air would have to be in the mid 30's to achieve dew. \\n\\nI called and let her know that without knowledge of what was the issue and that they wouldnt get the repair due to warranty of work, four other shops disproved her advice. \\n\\nMy third call found to be less friendly as I couldnt get a word in as Mrs. Ayers insisted on screaming the whole conversation. This resulted in me talking louder due to not being able to get a word in. \\n\\nI let her know that if keeping the gas tank full were an important piece of information, why didnt they tell me to do such a thing when I originally picked up the first repair?\\n\\nShe told me that I needed to read the manual. I was informed to use the proper gas, stabilizer, why the mower had malfunctioned but they did not tell me how to keep the mower from malfunctioning again? When asked why again, she blew up and told me its not her job to make sure I know how the mower...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nMy children have been patients at Scottsdale Children's Group since my first son was born in April 2005. I absolutely LOVED this place and could not have imagined better care for my precious bundle. As the stork dropped off two more babies over the years, I continued to choose for them to be cared for at the Shea location of Scottsdale Children's Group. I constantly referred new moms to SCG. In 2010 (after being a 5 year veteran), I noticed a change. There was a lot of new front-office staff and the overall \\\"vibe\\\" of the entire practice seemed unhappy. I brushed it off thinking that we are in a recession and things must be difficult for ALL businesses right now. I hung in there for another 3 years through times of NO available (same day sick) appts. and grumpy comments from staff (including doctors) during well-check appts.. Until today. I have TWO sick children home from school. I called at 8am to make an appt. for both children. 10:15am (thank goodness it was available)! I get them fed, dressed & out the door with time to spare. We arrived promptly at 10:15am through the sick-child entrance. They took my $25 per child co-pay and asked me to have a seat. ONE HOUR LATER, we are still sitting in the front waiting room. My daughter is lethargic with her head on my lap and my son is crying, \\\"Can we please just go home\\\"?! We were there for help that never seemed to be coming. I asked for my co-pay back at the front desk and drove my children home. My daughter threw up on the car ride home, but I felt as though I only had myself to blame. I should have left Scottsdale Children's Group years ago when I only had good memories of baby days in my rear-view mirror. I will NEVER go back. My children deserve better...... and so do yours. If you are reading this in search of a pediatrician. Keep looking. While the doctors are very skilled, the \\\"customer service\\\" is severely lacking. Ask friends for referrals, but don't decide on SCG if your children, your time and your money are hot ticket items for you. You can...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

Apply sunblock and reapply every hour! That can't be stressed enough.\\n\\nSalt River Tubing surpassed my expectations in terms of customer service and comfort. Given the sheer volume of customers as we arrived, things moved pretty quickly, from waiting in line for our tubes or waiting to board the antiquated bus. $15 buys you an intertube rental and roundtrip bus ride to/from your riverside entry/exit. But if you can supply your own tubes and/or rides, it's free, or $12 for the roundtrip bus ride. Lucky for us it was Pirate Day and our bus driver was an absolute riot, taking the corners extremely fast and mumbling at his parrot. Additionally, we got to gawk at all the pirate themed groups of people as they floated past. Tubing veterans are apparent with their inflatable rafts, blow-up swimming pools and waterproof sound systems. THAT is the way to do it folks.\\n\\nBe prepared to be pelted by marshmallows from fellow floaters and to see other assorted garbage floating about.

I guess their HUGE wine/beer/drink list was pretty impressive, but the food...was not.  My first disappointment was in the size of the menu.  I looked it up online and they seemed to have a wide array of choices, when I saw the actual menu, I think there were 5 entree choices, in addition to a wide variety of tapas.  On top of that, the one dish I wanted, was sold out, so I went with the Smoked Duck and Brie Pizza.  I mean, it was OK, there was a good amount of duck on the pizza but the whole time I was craving more brie!!  They could have seriously doubled the amount of brie on the pizza and it still might not have been enough, I could hardly taste it.  Also, it wasn't really a pizza at all, more like a cold flatbread, so be forewarned.  I also ordered a small side salad.  It was a delicious spinach salad, but lived up to the \\\"small\\\" definition....AND it was $6--give me a break.  If I'm looking to drink, maybe I'll stop by next time I'm in town, but I'll hit up K.O. Fusion or Jim Gould over this place ANY day!\n\nReview rating:",

        "To put it in one line Fleming's is a 3-star restaurant posing as a 5-star restaurant.\\n\\nThe issue for me at my visit to Flemings was service.  The hostess was rather unenthusiastic.  It seemed was just her job to point us in the correct direction, which was the bar to wait as our table got prepared.  For a 5-star place, a reservation is a reservation, and the table should darned well be ready when advertised.  I expect to wait for a table at Outback, with the little buzzing and flashing beeper, but Flemings isn't Outback.  Right?  And as I will state later, getting the food orders correct was an even larger issue.\\n\\nFor background, I was part of a large group (11 people) for dinner.  The bread served before the meal was absolutely delicious; fresh, hot, with a crispy crust, tender middle.  Drinks and salads were ordered.  I got a Caesar salad, and all I can say is that it was adequate. I have had a better Caesar salad at my employer's cafeteria.  But, I'm not there for the salad.  Fleming's is all about steaks.  \\n\\nThe server moved around the table and took orders.  Our server was cheery and tried to make small-talk conversation with the table.  She took the orders where overall there were 8 steak orders (some of the couples got one meal and split it) and various sides.  I ordered the prime rib-eye; whenever I go to a steak place, it is my benchmark meal.  When the food arrived I had a very nice, although I would call it a bit small piece of Filet Mignon in front of me.  A very nice cut of meat, but it wasn't what I ordered.  Also, one of the couples at the table was not brought any food.  So, doing the math, the serving staff has a 25% chance in bungling your order.  The staff re-took the incorrect/missing orders and about 5 minutes later the manager was by to apologize.  The couple who had the missing order was offered a shrimp cocktail; I was not.  Maybe that is why I'm the odd person at the table.  I started munching on the community sides watching my other friends enjoying their steaks.  As for the... My rating for this place is",

        "Review text:\nOne of the best lunches I've ever had was eaten at The Capital Grill. Sure, it might have been because it was free and I was able to order anything I wanted. Plus, we got complimentary apps and the dessert of our choice, but even then, the food was excellent. Trust me, \\\"excellent\\\" is not a word I throw around very often. \\n\\nIt was a business lunch, but I couldn't help but admire the wine list and imagine coming back here for dinner sometime. It would make a really great date place, especially if you splurged on the valet out front. After all, it is the Biltmore. And, let's face it, even I like getting dolled up every once in a while. \\n\\nBack to lunch. I sampled the jumbo shrimp in the shrimp sauce, along with some really perfectly breaded calamari, which was the best calamari my lips have ever come across. I ordered the crab/lobster burger, which was presented as a seafood mix between a whole grain bun. Every bite was better than the last. I delightfully ate the entire thing. \\n\\nThen, it was time for dessert. I chose the flour-less espresso cake. Unbelievable. It was so thick and rich, though, that I left half behind. Then again, who really needs to eat the entire piece? Granted, it was packed with so much sugar, I immediately began to droop into a mid-afternoon coma. But, I didn't care. I just had one of the best lunches of my entire life. \\n\\nSometimes I remember that lunch and I shake my head. Never mind it was for business. Never mind I didn't have any wine. Never mind I had to go back to work after wards. I still rate that lunch and this restaurant at 5 stars. Imagine how wonderful this could be if you order a glass of wine and go for a special occasion with a special someone. Wow.

        "First I'll start off with the homemade beer.  Nothing spectacular, but it has flavor and is very reasonably priced, as is the menu.  I went with the potato pancake Reuben.  HOLY CRAP.  Probably the most filling meal I've ever ate, but it was worth it.  My boyfriend was pretty happy he got to finish my leftovers.  The German potato salad I had for my side was equally as good.  It had a bit of a bite to it, which I really liked.  I also had to try my boyfriends meal.  He went with one of the wursts, but the exact name is escaping me.  It was made with veal, and was so light and tender - YUM.  That will be my meal when we return.  I can't believe it took me so long to eat here!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "I walk into this place and there's not one single soul in sight. I walk towards the back and find two women working what I assume is the deli section. I ask for a menu and she walks to the draft section and brings me back a paper pamphlet. I was craving soup but couldn't find any on the menu. They must have soup, after all this is a deli. I ask one of the women if and what soups they have. She mumbled something. I think she said there's only a little vegetable soup left. I expected a few options, broccoli and cheese or something at least. So I turn around and notice a couple coolers full of beer and bombers on shelves. But why waste the money? I know they're all overpriced like all Pittsburgh bars are. I'd be better off going draft, so I walk to the draft section. Once again I had to ask for something, this time a beer list. The lady walks to the deli section and brings me back the beer list. So the menu is in the draft section and the beer list is in the deli section? That's logical. I look over the list but it's literally all local beers. Maybe they are attracting tourists? Don't get me wrong, there are some great local beers, but us local connoisseurs have had all the greats. Boring. So I walk out. That's that. I was fascinated that not one person walked in throughout all of this being the middle of South Side and Wednesday lunch hours. I'm assuming all these reviews were from a Friday or Saturday night, and that's the only time I'm giving this place another chance. My rating for this place is",

Chips are hot and not greasy.  Two kinds of dip.\\n\\nTheir $7 lunch specials are all uniformly good.  Try the chicken quesadilla lunch special if you are feeling bad, or the $8 shrimp enchiladas in jalapeno butter if you are feeling decadent, or grilled chicken salad with tortilla soup (more like stew here) if you are feeling healthy.\\n\\nOn Wednesdays, you must try the best fish tacos in Arizona.  NOT FRIED.  Grilled tallapia type fish, with a little cream sauce, some shredded cabbage, in a corn tortilla.  I go with coworkers and they order 5 for $1.25 each, and along with the chips, they are stuffed to the gills and only spent $5 plus tip.\\n\\nSeriously... Wednesdays for Fish Tacos.  Remember.  Even if you aren't usually a fan of fish tacos.\\n\\nIt's tacky decorations.  It's cheap vinyl booths.  And the service is not terrific (secret... if you are in a rush, bring your bill to counter to pay, don't wait at the table).\\n\\nIn a city of good Mexican food, if you are looking for entrees less than $12, there is no better Mexican food in Phoenix.\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nTraditionally this has been one of my favorite restaurants growing up in North Phoenix.  I do miss the good old days when their menu was awesome and the waiters and waitresses had a bit of a pep in their step and were eager to please.  I realize that the economic conditions have been less than ideal but I had one of the worst experiences around Christmas time.  Our waitress seemed to sympathize with us and our long wait as she comped our soft drinks.  I left heart broken and came to the sad conclusion that this place is a shell of its former self and will never be the same again.  With that said, everyone deserves a second chance and from what I understand this family owned chain has been to hell and back and are somehow still open.  Because this place is iconic in the valley of the sun and because it gave me so many warm and happy memories, I will be back shortly with an open mind and a healthy appetite.  For now I will base this review on my collective experience at this restaurant as I think they are entitled to it.  Just wish that my fellow diners who are new to the Big Apple or Phoenix for that matter could appreciate this place for what it once was and what I still believe it can be.\n\nStars:",

My first visit for lunch since the changes was great. Unfortunately, I thought dinner would be the same and it was borderline terrible. My falafel was cold and one side was a cheaper substitute for the tabouleh that I'm accustomed to having. Other patrons complained that their food was cold as well (which had to be reheated). My appetizer came near the end of dinner, the baklava was ridiculously small and the pitas I purchased were completely molded 3 days later. I've been a loyal customer for more than 10 years. It will be a long, long time before I ever go back and I won't recommend my friends eating here until I see improvement.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

We badly needed a break and a place to just sit down, eat, and talk about something else.\\n\\nWhen we first entered, the hostess, a blonde older lady, already had a crappy attitude. We'd come in two cars and there was a little confusion about whether my friend's husband and son were already there. The hostess was very snippy with my friend, I suspect because my friend is a larger lady. We let it go.\\n\\nBrisket sandwiches and some catfish: flippin' awesome. Our actual waitress was nice enough, thankfully. Desserts were consumed in spite of being stuffed from the nice entrees.\\n\\nWhen we finished we sat a bit and talked. The hostess approached and brought a bag for the leftover boxes. It was clear she wanted us OUT. My friend asked for water and the hostess said hotly, \\\"To GO?\\\" My friend said no, and that hostess was preeeeetty huffy about it.

Shortly after I moved in we had an ant problem in the first week. I went to the office so I could be put on the pest control list and the ants never went away so I had to buy my own bug spray and fix the problem.\\nThen about a month into being moved in the lock on my front door came completely out. When my bf told the office that our lock was broken and we both had work that day the lady told him someone should be there to fix it within the next hour. When I went on my break 4 hours later I called the office to make sure my house was locked and they told me no one had been there yet. Finally someone got there but they installed the new lock wrong and it's always a hassle to lock or unlock my door now. \\n  A few months after this I went to get a direct tv installment paper signed by the office and the First Lady I spoke with I could barely understand and she seemed to not know what she was doing. Then the property manager came out after I asked the First Lady if I could speak with her and she wouldn't go get her for me, and the manager was extremely rude about the situation with me. \\nAlso my laundry room closet door fell off the tracks completely one day and almost fell on my head. There are also a lot minor reports that weren't made before I moved in. \\n Lastly this week my boyfriend got his car out of the shop after 5 months and the tags he had were expired the day after we brought the car home the management put a tow away sticker on his car even though it was parked in an uncovered parking space and was doing nothing to anyone. \\nAnyone who is looking for a place that has a good management run complex DO NOT GO HERE!

I told them I have a family history of estrogen induced breast cancer. Their solution was to prescribe me a very high estrogen birth control pill which made me have horrific hot flashes. By the way, I'm 36, with no prior history or births. At this point, my mother insisted I get a second opinion.

Also they can get you in quickly for your initial visit and follow-up visits. \\n\\nThe Bad--he took out all four of my wisdom teeth, and I had to make two more visits for him to finish the job and get the remaining shards out.\\n\\nThe Ugly-- He's very arrogant, his professionalism is subpar, and he's insulting to his patients at time. \\n\\nWhen I came in the last time for him to remove the last part of the tooth he missed the previous two visits, he rubbed some ointment on the area to numb it. So as he comes towards my mouth with what looked like pliers to \\\"snip\\\" the tooth off, I asked if there was going to be any local anesthesia, his reply was the ointment was good enough and to \\\"stop being a wimp\\\". I was kind of shocked but knowing he's got these pliers in my mouth, I figured I'd laugh it off. Well then when he poked the side of my cheek with the pliers trying to get to the tooth, I kind of flinched. Woops, my mistake! He slings the pliers and mirror onto the tray, tells the assistant to get a local, and storms off. \\n\\nI had read reviews on another website of Dr. Day and they pretty much said the same thing. But I figured, i'd give him a shot anyway as my situation is a little more complicated that impacted, adult wisdom teeth. I don't regret going to him, but I can't recommend him.\n\nReview rating:",

Half of the things are at the end of their shelf life and some are even beyond that- basically some of the things are already gone bad that they are selling. Good luck returning things as the old lady will go psycho on you and start screaming...haha what a joke! I feel pity for them and anyone who might get an experience like I did when i tried to return honey that they sold me which was already bad, probably due to poor temperature control they have in their shop. \\nIn summers they rely on air coolers and you can imagine AZ 110 degree days. You would feel like you just walked in a oven....\\nThe old lady (owner) is rude and has no etiquettes of how to deal with a customer....I would recommend never walk into that shop or learn from your own bad experience. I wasted my time, money and had bad experience that is going to stick with me for quite some time. Feel bad for other single owners as she is representing them in the worst possible way. For the first time I realized some of the good things that big chains offer. Sorry for being so verbose...but she made us and my wife real upset!\n\nStars:",

        "This gym tends to get below average reviews due to its size, cleanliness, and volume of equipment. Having said that, this may be most people's worst gym. However, this gym is actually my favorite. I'm here about 4 days a week, sometimes twice a day. This gym is full of regulars. Like Cheers, where everyone knows your name.  I don't have a problem with the staff. In fact, they are like an extended family for me. I'm always greeted by name when I enter and leave. And no, they are not cheating by reading the computer screen. Usually greeted before I sign in. Feels like home here. When I walk in, usually get the hellos and nods from the other regulars. What I like most about this gym is that people are here to workout. Get in, get out.\\n\\nI do avoid this gym on Monday and Tuesday nights due to how crowded it can get. And, it's only crowded, because it's small. The rest rooms are filthy, but I don't use them anyway. \\n\\nOverall, gave this gym 4 stars because I'm able to get the type of workout I search for. People here tend to respect your workout and save their chatter with you once you're done.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I'm getting ready to bring our sweet baby Heart in tomorrow for her \\\"Big Girl\\\" surgery & caught up on her shots and routine examine health/ check up. I don't want to be up all night physically sick stressing over other people's reviews reading over and re-analyzing every last word. But I would like to thank CRAH- if it was not for your entire hospital and staff Heart would not be here alive now and have made it passed 5 months old- she just turned 5 in September. Before Heart we had Little Bear and with him was our first introduction to CRAH. They saved both of our Shiba Inu's lives Heart & Little Bear who has since gone to the rainbow bridge (who they handled his cremation for us). We didn't know about pet stores and thats where we got Bear in 07. We call both our rescue babies as we did save their lives from their start in a puppymill then to a \\\"death shop\\\" -  with the help and thanks to CRAH they both where saved. Little Bear  was beyond sick he was knocking on deaths front door. If you know the gimmick of how these death stores oops I meant pet store- how they operate and with their \\\"free vet\\\" visit then you understand what we went through pneumonia- incubation nebulizer treatments for both both of them . My grandma accidently let Little Bear out Jan of 09 when he was about a 1 1/2 old he was hit on the 215. My mom went to the same pet store traumatized over Bear and come home with Heart. \\n\\nSame thing all over with the pneumonia but she was even more sick than what we had already been through. There are just no words that you can express when it comes to saving lives and thats exactly what happened for our family 2 seperate times their lives where saved inside your hospital. Our little Heart girl is the glue that holds our family together she is our reason for living breathing and existing my girl is our lives. \\n\\nNow she is getting ready for her \\\"Big Girl\\\" surgery tomorrow.. Why now at 5 years old? Well we are bringing home our Shikoku puppy within a week and we have to get Heart ready so they...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nI wish I had a 'to be fair' line I could throw in here, but it's impossible. My wife and I ate at the Golden Steer on 5/16/13 (Her review is before the Golden Steer plant's review below mine.), and the food was simply horrible. For starters, we sat at the Marilyn Monroe table. Yes, the place has been open for a while, but they do stress the old star-power a bit much, making one wonder of the quality of the food. You'll see why I say this: \\n\\nWhen the bread and butter was brought out, we were eating it and noticed a really strange flavor. I tasted the butter on its own, and it tasted as if it had sat in the fridge for a very - very long time before being brought to our table. Sure we wanted to sit in Marilyn's booth, but we did not want to eat the same butter that was served to her!!! Right then and there I wanted to get out as fast as possible. Nevertheless, we decided to overlook this, notify the waiter, and give them another chance. He didn't bring out any more bread and butter, hence the bad butter must've been all they had. NOTE: Steak is often cooked with butter....\\n\\nThe ceasar salad came out and it was prepared at the table. We passed on the raw egg, which I feel is a wise move after reading previous reviews alleging salmonella. Barring that, the salad was edible. \\n\\nI ordered the ribeye medium rare, and my wife ordered the porterhouse steak. Mine actually was tasty, though bloody and borderline raw. My wife's porterhouse, on the other hand, was a different story. She told me her steak tasted a bit off, similar to liver. I took a taste. To me it tasted like pee! I spit the bite into my napkin.   The waiter attempted damage control by bringing her a slab of prime rib. She didn't like it. I tasted it, and it was bland, unsalted, and I have had better at $15 buffets - time and time again. \\n\\nI really wish I didn't have to write such a scathing review, but this place is priced like an exclusive fine-dining establishment, yet prepares food like as if to act in direct defiance of the health dept. We will...\n\nStars:",

        "Me and my fianc\\u00e9 haven't been to this restaurant since 2010. The food was good but the service is HORRIBLE. We used to work across the street and on certain days we weren't able to leave on our lunch break because of limited staff. We only had the option to bring lunch or order out. One day we ordered a sausage Rosatis pizza and when it came it was pepperoni but we didn't notice until after the delivery person had left because we were with customers. When we noticed it was pepperoni we called to ask that our pizza be replaced with the correct order. Whoever answered was very rude and said that they took the order themselves and that we had ordered pepperoni. I hate pepperoni. I never order pepperoni. It just adds pools if grease to your pizza. Anyway, we were stuck with the pizza because no one would fix our order and I have never been back. It was such a bad experience that I have told everyone I know about it. I've never been treated so poorly. I wish I could give it 0 stars.\\n\\nBottom line: double check your orders before you get off the phone. These people do not take ownership of their mistakes and  you could be stuck with what ever they decide to give you. My rating for this place is",

        "Review: Two things really stood out for me when visiting the Flying Saucer. 1. The beer selection is amazing. Excellent draft selection and a long bottle list. 2. The service is top notch. All the servers were beautiful, attentive, fast, and beer knowledgeable. The food is good but not great. Had the Hippie Burger which was supposed to have a jalapeno pesto. The burger was good but there was no taste of jalapeno at all which is what I was hoping for. The group I was with shared the pretzels (incredible spicy mustard) and the rocket tots. The pretzels were good but the tots were nothing to rave about. The next time I went had the beer and cheese soup and shared a pizza, which again both were good but not great. I would definitely come back again for the beer and service though.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nThis store will not let you photograph their lighting fixtures. We browsed for a while and found a chandelier we liked, and my husband took a picture of it on his cell phone. The salesclerk told us that was not allowed. We were dumbfounded. We are renovating a house and need a number of light fixtures, plumbing fixtures, etc.-- the only way we can keep track of them all (and check if they actually might look good together) is to photograph everything we're seriously considering. We tried to explain this and the clerk said nope, not allowed. We asked why. She said, \\\"I don't know-- they just don't allow it.\\\" Well I bet I know-- they don't want you going online in search of better pricing. But hey, NEWSFLASH-- that's how things work in 2012. I'm not going to drop $1,200 on a chandelier without looking it up online. (For the record, I understand that local businesses aren't usually going to have the lowest price available. I don't mind paying a bit of a premium to support a small business in Pittsburgh that gave me great in-person service. But like hell am I going to spend that kind of money without making sure I'm not getting completely ripped off.)\\n\\nWe tried to press further, though-- what about matching finishes or colors to other fixtures? The salesclerk said, \\\"Oh, people just tell us what colors they have in their room and how big the room is and we tell them what works.\\\" I'm sorry, but unless you're omniscient, this is not acceptable. \\n\\nThe most insulting thing, though, is the clerk telling us \\\"I don't know\\\" about a policy that's so clearly the exception to the local norm. If you're going to have a ridiculous, anachronistic rule, at least have the guts to explain why to customers when they ask.\n\nReview rating:",

Sometimes experiences are extremely that bad. \\n\\nMy experience took place last weekend as I was in Phoenix to attend my Graduation Ceremony at Grand Canyon University. The weekend of my graduation there was a lot of events happening. There was a  rodeo and county fair going on this particular weekend. This brought in sleazy and trashy individuals who ruined any chance or relaxation. Basically every neighbor was getting loud and drunk and it prevented any rest. I did not feel safe in this environment. My parents who are 60 and 70 could not rest in their room, so they left to my state to drive home. \\n\\nLaQuinta, during check out Jesus a matter of fact said since I purchased my stay from a third party Hotels.com, that I would have to contact them, and then they together would authorize a refund for  a night. I just called Hotels.com and LaQuinta had the gull to deny they had told me they would refund me for one night. \\n\\nI would suggest you choose to stay somewhere else as much as possible.

Everything has been super tasty, especially the pepperoni rolls that everyone have been raving about. We got the prosciutto ravioli to cook at home and it was tasty! I would also recommend buying pizza crust here because it's super cheap and much better than any store bought crust.

        "A-OK.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, this is a Korean restaurant, but supposedly, they do have fish and chips.  Secondly, and equally important, is that this is a cash only establishment.  Now it's no secret that I'm especially critical of Asian cuisine.  It's not that I'm that much of a connoisseur (I wish); it's that my expectations have grown to be that high.  Don't let my rating fool you away from this establishment.\\n\\nI also need to curb my enthusiasm some because I'm such a big fan of mom & pop restaurants.  This place quite literally is only that: pop serving up front and mom cooking in the back.  That fact alone makes me giddy about this place.  The locale has something to be desired, but as a lunch option, it's nothing scary.  Also, for being cash only, I thought this place was kind of pricey.  Entr\\u00e9e portion size wasn't too bad, but the kimchi selection was definitely sub-par.  Luckily, it was all friggin' delicious.\\n\\nI got the pork bul go gi.  Those unfamiliar: it's Korean BBQ.  Those familiar: no, they don't have the DIY grills -- it's served already cooked on a cast-iron hot-plate.  They offer in mild, medium, or hot.  The hot will get your attention, but I recommend going for medium and supplementing with the hot sauce they have at the table.  I swear they must lace that sauce with something-something because it's that awesome.  The food is all made to order by the one-woman-team, which means in a group, someone will get their food before someone else.  She doesn't make it all at once, and he doesn't wait until the whole order is ready.  Yet that signifies how freshly the food is prepared.  Service was prompt, courteous, and friendly, with the language barrier not really an issue.\\n\\nPlaces like this seem to be a rarity in Vegas, so I highly encourage local support.  At least give it a shot.  I yearn to find more places like this, but in the mean time, I'll probably be back here. My rating for this place is",

        "Review: Uncle Sam's specializes in cheesesteaks, and that's all I've gotten so far during the three times that I've gone here in 3 months.\\n\\nHere's the breakdown:\\nMeat - Mediocre.  Not distinctive/nothing special. my friend and i usually grab the seasoning on the side table and season each bite we take with that seasoning + black pepper.\\n\\nveggie/meat ratio = just right. this is one of the more important factors when it comes to a delicious cheesesteak, imo. you need the greens to help regulate the meatiness.\\n\\nbread: a tad heavy/thick for my taste, but the fact that it doesn't get soggy satisfies me very much so. too many times, I've tasted a cheesesteak where the bread was starting to melt with the juices coming from the meat inside.\\n\\ni'm also a huge fan of sweet potato fries, and i would say that they do them very well! some people cut them too short and fry them too long to the point that the sweetness got completely fried out of existence.  the thickness of the cut of each sweet potato fry, along with the length in which they fry these things for makes for a perfect sweet potato fry! i'd come here simply for the sweet potato fries. too bad you can't substitute the regular fries that come with your cheesesteak with the sweet potato fries. you have to get them separately. if you make the mistake of not realizing this and tell the cashier you want a cheesesteak with sweet potato fries, prepare to eat a lot of fries (to me, it's a dream come true until my next blood test).\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Seriously, it was kind of amazing.\\n\\ni highly recommend this clinic.  it took us half an hour to get there and it was totally worth it.\\n\\nthey also offer boarding and some supplies and toys.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "First time going to a hooters joint other than Vegas locations. Very attractive looking servers...but thats about it. I was unlucky to discover that my 9th wing out of 10 was undercooked with chicken juice...yuk its been over a day and i feel sick to the stomach still. My waitress was a very nice girl but is uneducated or is she an air head she laughed at me when i showed her the bloody chicken. She was like...oh my god...bahahahaha..! I am a waitress myself and i just could not understand her behavior. Doesnt she know the basic health code? She has a health card...duh..Asked her carefully to have her manager out to my table. Same...same..same.. He had his hands in his pocket. Looked very bothered. Insisted to me that it is the tendon. I squized the blood juice out of it and showed and he just asked. \\\"So what do you want?\\\" I told him they were very lucky that it was my 9th wing. If it were to be my first few wings(?) whats. Up. Ugh. \\nHe made me feel like some cheap customer asking for a free meal. I told him i just dont want to come back. And told him how they dealt with this situation was very unprofessional. Sarcastically. He gave me a 2 dollar discount. And his waitress circled the 2.dallor off and wrote thank you! On it. Haha. He tossed a 10 dollar off coupon saying if u want.. Blah blah after his insulting 2 dollar discount. \\nSomething similar happened to me about 5 years ago at wingstop. They closed down a few month later. Man. Cook and treat your chicken right!!!!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: Pleasantly surprised. Located adjacent to O'Reilly Auto Parts- Padre Murphy's offers a Sports Bar Oasis to those who find it.\\n\\nWe were there for the 'St. Pierre vs. Shields' fight. We were not charged a cover and were able to find a booth for our party of 6.\\n\\nFYI, after the 'Live'  coverage, they do offer replays of the match AND offer $1 Sliders to go with. I had ordered the prime rib sliders and paid $9... I could have waited.\\n\\nDrinks were pretty standard. They did have mojitos, which many sports bars don't seem to offer. TONS OF TVs. My BF thought the on-tap selection was pretty average but did like the mini pitchers they offered for any draft beer.\\n\\nA disappointment was a server. I think she was 12 years old and had no idea what beers were on tap. Even when my BF ordered Red Rover because he saw the tap head, she said that they did not carry that beer... we had to convince her to just put the order in and see what happened. Low and behold, a mini pitcher of Red Rover came out 15 minutes later!\\n\\nFood is pretty standard- no gross disappointments. My slider wasn't that great but they do have a Huge variety of sandwiches.\\n\\nOnly true negative is the parking. Many of the parking spots are reserved for the surrounding businesses. There were a few announcements being made throughout the game about people's cars getting towed by O'Reilly's.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I honestly thought I was going to have to leave the restaurant. However, they were bringing out DELICIOUS looking lobster, crab, and some whole fish. Smell went away after about a minute and I have no idea what in the world it could possibly have been coming from. \\n\\nWe ordered Mongolian Beef, Kung Pao chicken and a vegetarian mushroom dish.

But the menu looked terribly typical of what you'd find in any ol' diner. I had the vegetarian quesadilla out of hunger and everything else looked terribly deep-fried. It was decent but made with regular cheddar or American cheese--so definitely not special. A person in my group had a Vodka gimlet that he said was all Vodka. The waitresses with eye make-up and other thematic elements of the restaurant didn't do enough to disguise the fact that this place is nothing short of mediocre. Maybe I'll upgrade if I ever go back and try something else on the menu and like it.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I have purchased a few dresses and tops from this location over the last couple of months and every time I have been in my experience has only been so so. The sales associates in the women's dress department can be either too pushy or completely non existent but not a good balance of one or the other. I have had a little bit of a better experience in the accessories department and the associates in that department seem to be more interested in what you are looking for and how to help rather than just making a sale. I also had an issue recently with needing to return an item that was in perfect condition with tags attached but it had been just a few days over the return policy limit. The manager was able to give me a store credit which I appreciated because I knew I was over the limit of the return policy. Overall this store is just okay.

We sat for about 15 minutes before anybody greeted us or took our drink order. I felt abandoned many times. I had to sit there and stare at my salad (once I finally got it) for a while before they brought silverware.

They have bread bowl with broccoli and cheese soup or clam chowder. Yum. I suggested it to my husband and he was so excited. We ate there and of course I ordered a bread bowl and salad. My husband ordered a sandwich and a bread bowl. He loved it. Now we have a place to go to when y husband is craving a sandwich. I gave Dilly's 4 stars only because the floor looked kind of dirty and it needs some decorations.

        "Review: The place is pretty crowded most of the time, so the first time i was here the waiter was super unattentive and we got charged 14 dollars for an OATMEAL?! say whuuuuu, it's 5 dollars for fresh strawberries, uhmm they give you like 5 chopped up strawberries, then its 3 dollars for half a banana, such a rip off they dind't tell us, although the manager did take off money which was super nice, then i got my baby cousin a silver dollar chocolate chip pancakes with no whip cream and no powdered sugar, guess what, they put all of that on, ohkay wow, so lastly i got the chocolate chip pancakes it was pretty good, but the whip cream is a bit too thick, and after about 2 pancakes, you really don't wanna eat it anymore, you feel really groggy and gross, although it is delicious, the second time i came it was a lot better, but still.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I have been to other Denny's that have taken expired coupons and many other restaurants will take expired coupons too, so I wasn't pleased with that.

They start at 10 am so it's not a early breakfast place. It's a little spendy for breakfast that's why only 4 stars.

Hard to beat that.\\n\\nThis location suffers from one major flaw - that it is located alongside a busy road in the parking lot of a Home Depot.  So, this means there are tons of... let's say... loiterers.  When a patrol car occasionally makes a round through here, the loiterers all scramble into Del Taco or run in various directions.  They also stare at your car in the parking lot if it happens to be nice.\\n\\nSo, drive your beater if you eat here, and don't eat here if you're bothered by a lot of loiterers outside.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I ordered the burrito lunch special which was $5.99.  The server asked me if I wanted guacamole and sour cream.  I said yes. When the bill came, I had been charged a dollar extra for each item.  My cheap burrito wasn't as cheap as I wanted it to be.  A dollar for a dollop of sour cream???  Give me a break...\\n\\nOne of my coworkers ordered extra lettuce and tomato, got charged 50 cents!  Iced tea was pricey too, $2.50.  We also got the cheese fundido.  $8.00 for a little skillet with melted cheese and jalapenos.  The food was good but I think that a little warning of if you want extras, be prepared to pay extra $$$.\\n\\nThere were three of us and we each paid $17.00 for lunch!

        "Review: I'm visiting Mesa from Los Angeles. I checked in at this hotel last night. The older front desk woman obviously did not like me and my face full of piercings (I'm really nice, I swear!) I have a temporary bank card while my bank mails me my new one, she wouldn't accept it. I've never run into that before, but it makes sense. But she was NOT nice about it. So I walked in the 100\\u00b0 heat to an ATM and back. Then she wants a $20 deposit that wasn't mentioned when I called earlier to inquire about the price. Fine. She asks if I'll have guests, I said I wasn't sure yet. I was charged for two people. Ok. She asked about 20 times if I was sure I didn't smoke/have a dog/or a car. Where she thinks I was hiding a dog, I'll never know.\\n\\nThe room itself was clean and comfortable enough for the price. No complaints about the room itself. Vending machines, a fridge, and microwaves available.\\n\\nLater that night I went outside to play on my phone and get some fresh air. She chased me outside asking \\\"if I was leaving yet?\\\" Nice.\\n\\nI had a relative come to say hello. Except, she chased him off the property saying \\\"this was a quiet place\\\". He's a middle aged, boring looking business guy. So I was specifically charged for TWO people, and she ran off my relative anyways.\\n\\nI go down to check out. At this point it's obvious she thinks I'm a prostitute, so I pack up to leave. Shoot, even a prostitute would deserve better customer service than this. I give my key, and the old office guy asks if there's anyone still in the room?!? He knows darn well my only visitor was chased off twenty minutes prior. He gives me my deposit, and I leave.\\n\\nI've worked in motels before. As a guest I am quiet, sober, clean, and I always tip. But yes, I look goth/punk. I was treated beyond disrespectfully. Technically, I was ripped off too. I can't recommend this place to anyone. Though I'm sure normal looking folks don't receive this sort of treatment. I'm still beyond offended.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Disappointing ... I really enjoy The Capital Grill most times and this experience left a poor taste for the Charlotte location. Our service and the food was, at best, two-star. I know I did not have the steak but typically I can count on this chain to deliver a good meal - if not great (my last visit in Downers Grove, IL in December was fabulous).\\n\\nWhen we were told we could not get a table for an hour we decided to sit at the bar.  After about 15 minutes the host said he could seat us - we should have been suspicious at this point. We went outside to our table that had trash and leaves around the edges of the patio (hey, wait they didn't just blow there last night).  Our tablecloth had stains and spots on the silverware. \\n\\nIt took a good 15-20 minutes for our server to come take an order after bread and water were dropped. We asked to start with the fresh mozzarella, tomato, and basil with 12-year aged balsamic. When it arrived it was two neat stacks on one plate and one empty plate. When we asked the server why it was not split his response was \\\"we can't split this salad.\\\" Ok - not as if we asked to split an escargot- the salad was almost perfectly portioned for two. Not to bother we just shared. The sliced tomatoes were mealy and flavorless and only one leaf of basil per stack. There was a nice marinated grape tomato as a garnish but I didn't pay for a tasty garnish. \\n\\nThe main course we tried the grouper special. I've had better. The grouper was ok (notice the theme) but the shrimp that came with the special was overlooked and tough. Our sides - saut\\u00e9ed spinach and the wild mushrooms were good. We ordered a 1/2 order of both which is just perfect for two people. My only comment is we pulled eight whole cloves of garlic out of the spinach before eating it. Vampires beware ,,,\\n\\nOur drinks were never tended too and the front server never bothered to follow up on the salad. I hope everyone inside had a better experience.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "If this place wasn't up on a hill, it might be a hipster paradise. As it stands, it is a beloved and well-attended local bar with frequent karaoke nights. I've been there twice, and so far the bartender has been the same wonderful, slightly hurried lady, who remembered us the second time around and who was willing to help me experiment by making a manly cocktail with a raw egg shaken into it. I guess it helps that the other half of Billy's bar is Billy's restaurant, with eggs to spare. A good time is always had, belting out the classics with friendly faces and free popcorn abounding.  Be forewarned: if you start coming every week, some of the classics will become even more \\\"classic\\\", as you start to realize your new friends have favourite songs to jive to on a regular basis....\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nA great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. \\n\\nThe staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.\\n\\nWe ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!\\n\\nMy advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know.\n\nReview rating:",

The pizza is really made well. Favorites include the Hawaiian and the Mediterranean.  The tortellini is also done very well and the portion size is good for one and won't leave you hungry or hurting.  The calzones are very good too and very large!  They come out very quick. The Caesar salad is one not to miss as a starter. Their dressing is outstanding!  The service is so helpful and friendly and the atmosphere is very cozy Italian.

        "Review: My go-to place for Chinese food here in Las Vegas. Used to be Food Express on Decatur but since the chefs all moved here, well, you get it.\\n\\nWe come here almost once a week since my mom loves the garlic salt and pepper (Bei Fung Tong) crab not to be mistaken for the salt and pepper crab (which is also good). The ginger and scallions lobster is good too! As of course is the fresh steamed fish with soy sauce.\\n\\nIf you like fish, for less than approximately 1/7 of the price of the fresh (swimming) fish, order the sea bass tofu clay pot. The fish is lightly fried and stewed in clay pot. This is my favorite dish. My other new discovery thanks to my less adventurous nephew is the fried chicken. Mmmm...fried chicken.\\n\\nThey offer a lot of specials known only to locals, like cheaper lobster between 3-5pm and late night happy hour on food. You also get a free steamed chicken if you order the crab and have more than 4 people eating.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The food is well spiced and flavored, but the main problem I had was that some dishes tasted exactly the same.  The Korma and Mattar Paneer should be two distinct tasting dishes, even though the color of the sauce is the same.  The Korma has a little bit of a sweeter taste normally.  The naan was not too special and slightly burned.  I would say the service was similar to an upscale restaurant.

Are you kidding me?  $6 for a milkshake?  It was tiny.  Not to mention it was not much of a milkshake.  It was a peanut butter cup shake.  They took some peanut butter cups, crushed them and stirred them into custard with some milk.  I saw the whole process.  It was not very impressive whatsoever.  The flavor was ok.  \\n\\n2 - The food.  I had a chili cheese dog.  This is my standard order when it is available on the menu.  The chili tasted like Hormel.  The hot dog was hot and the chili was warm.  I like that they have shredded cheese on it, rather than liquid cheese.\\n\\n3 - My dining companion got a burger.  It tasted ok, but it was a very thing patty. He also ordered cheese curds with it.  They were so greasy and lacked any good flavor in the breading.  \\n\\nOverall, we spent nearly $20 there and I was not satisfied with my meal.  Every talks so much about how great the custard is.

        "I've been to this place a couple of times, mainly for team lunches, so I thought I'd review it this time.  When you walk in, you get that classy Asian vibe.   It's fairly upscale looking.  But the first thing I noticed was how few Chinese people there are.  I think I was the only one.  \\n\\nWe had the chicken lettuce wrap for the appetizer. The chicken was not as tender as some other lettuce wraps I've had, and the soysauce may have overpowered the taste of the chicken.  But it was edible.  I tried one of the lunch bowls: pepper steak.  It said it should by spicy, but I couldn't feel the spice.  The beef was cooked well, but they ODed on the sauce making it too salty.  \\n\\nI thought the dessert shooters were really cute.  It's a good portion for those who want to have some desserts but not overstuff ourselves after a heavy main course.  The tiramisu shooter isn't as good.  But then it's not expected to have a tiramisu flavor in a Chinese oriented place.  It tastes more like a tiramisu cake instead of the traditional soft and creamy tiramisu I'm used to at an Italian restaurant.\\n\\nWhat I do like about the restaurant is the different tea flavors you can choose from.  And they bring it out for you in a traditional Chinese/Japanese like teapot to set the Asian mood.  It's a good alternative for a tea house. \\n\\nPf Chang's is good to have food for the people who like the Chinese-American fusion.  It may be a good place to start if you're scared of \\\"real\\\" Chinese food.  It's not a good place for authentic Chinese food.  And the price is more than I would pay for average tasting lunch.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nHorrible! I would score with no stars if there was such an option. This store ruined a $200+ silk shirt that is dry clean only.  This shirt has been dry cleaned once before (by a different dry cleaner) and was handled with care.  After the trip to D'elia's, the sleeves were totally ruined and tiny holes were punctured in the fabric.  (It looked as though it had been caught in a machine.)  After bringing the blouse to the store to report the issue, I received a letter in the mail from \\\"Anthony D'elia\\\" with an insert from the \\\"International Fabric Institute\\\" explaining why my fabric now looks the way that it does.  The note said I can pick up my damaged shirt at my D'elia's location.  Absolutely condescending.  The bottom line is that I brought in a shirt for cleaning and when I picked it up it was in a condition that was no longer wearable. \\n\\nAs an aside, I mentioned this experience at my firm and one of colleagues chimed in that she used a different D'elia's location to have a designer evening gown cleaned following a black tie event and they damaged her gown as well.  She received a similar note.  What a joke.\n\nReview rating:",

Ok, listen, I know Iarrived about 5 min before they closed their kitchen but I called about 15 min earlier and phoned my order for pickup. This still doesn't excuse them for selling crap. The pizza was super thin with virtually no sauce or crust. I know NY pizza is kinda supposed to be thin but \\\"common man\\\"! Even the ingredients were terrible. Low quality bread cheese n pepperoni. I really honestly feel that a Tony's frozen pizza from the super market would have been better. The wings were overcooked, sauceless and very very salty. The only reason I did not take this stuff back is because they were about 4 miles away and my brother n I were very hungry. I come from Los Angeles and I have only been in AZ for a little over 1 month but so far my experience with pizza hasn't been great. This place should be ashamed to serve the crap they do. I never even write reviews good or bad but they got me to actually write one. I would have rated negative stars if I could... SMFH!! I will neva, eva, evaevaevaevaevaevaevaeva.... come here again! Go to Oregano's instead. It's like night and day even though you have to wait forever, it's well worth it.\n\nStars:",

Hot & crispy with just enough sauce to give them a little bite and not loose the crispiness of the big juicy wings. \\n\\nThe beer was cold and the shoot of Tequila I had was ample to say the least. Only they don't stock my friend Jose' ...What's up with that so I had some off brand I never heard of call Tres Amigos.

        "I contacted Superstition Springs Lexus via the internet and expressed interest in a used vehicle they advertised. We made an appointment to go out and see the vehicle and made sure the internet person was aware I was driving over 40 minutes to see the vehicle.  I received a number of texts letting me know they were waiting for me and provided me with the appointment time via text and email.  So far my experience was great.  About 30 minutes before our appointment, While driving out there, I received a message from a sales person named Steve.  His message said and they were waiting for us and wanted to confirm our appointment.  When we arrived, we met Rashad the internet sales person and he said we would be working with Steve.  We met Steve, and he was not the least bit friendly.  He appeared disheveled and was the typical used car sales person - not what I would have expected at a Lexus dealership.  He started talking about finding us a vehicle to which I told him we were out there to look at a specific vehicle.  He said he knew nothing about it even though I saw he was holding the sheet that had the information about the vehicle we were looking for.  He said he wasn't sure it was available.  I told him that if it wasn't, we would be leaving.  He went  and got the internet guy Rashad and we were advised the vehicle was no longer available but they would be happy to show us a different vehicle.  I told him the least he could have done was called me to save me the drive.  I completely understand that vehicles come and go, but the fact that they didn't advise me  when they had just left me a message, leads me to believe they were up to typical used car sales  tricks.  I'm assuming by the reviews that buying a new car at Superstition Springs Lexus is a different experience than buying a used one.  I made the decision to go to Superstition Springs Lexus because I thought they were a reputable dealership, I wanted to completely avoid the typical used car sales people.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what we got.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I know this turns many people off, but if you give the place a chance, I don't think you will be disappointed.  As I said earlier, the food is quite good.  My favorite is \\\"The Straw\\\".  It contains mounds of hot pastrami, melted Swiss, and sauerkraut.  You have your choice of bread and I always choose the onion roll.  If you like corned beef, try \\\"The New Yorker\\\".  It's similar to \\\"The Straw\\\" but with corned beef and coleslaw.  All sandwiches include fries and a pickle spear.  You can add everything from macaroni and cheese to steamed veggies on the side.  A typical lunch will set you back $10-$11, but most people can make 2 meals out of the sandwich.

The entire establishment had about 3 other people in here at 8pm on a Thursday.  Where was everyone?  \\n\\nSeeing that they had a great variety of beers on tap (the main reason why we came), we decided to order 2 separate flights of 4 beers.  I gotta say, I'm a big fan of Levante Brewing Company.  Their maltier beers dominated my flight, and I really enjoyed the experience.  As with any flight, a few of the beers for both my colleague and I were hit or miss, but the 4 beer samples for $7 made it a worthwhile experience.  \\n\\nWe actually left without food because we wanted to seek out a place with a bit more atmosphere for dinner.  I would definitely come here for a quiet place to sample beers!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "We went to Pedro's tonight for dinner.  We haven't been there in a couple of years, after having a mediocre dinner last time.  We thought we would give it another try.  BIG BIG BIG Mistake.\\n\\nThe place is filthy.  The entrance is a mess with cigarette butts all over.  The booths are appalling with the fabric frayed to the point that the foam rubber is showing.  There is dirt on every surface.\\n\\nThe food was awful.  The chips were very salty and the salsa is bland and uninspired.\\nThe enchiladas (chicken) had little chicken.  The waiter brought my dinner and a lemon on the platter fell onto the table as he was delivering it.  Instead of taking it and getting another HE PICKED IT UP off of the table and placed it in the middle of my plate.\\n\\nThe restaurant will close sometime soon---no question about it.   There is so much deferred maintenance, the place is filthy, the food disgusting and the wait staff and management a group of amateurs who have no vested interest in providing good service.\\n\\nI remember the Pedro's of years ago and it bares no resemblance to the disgusting restaurant it has become\\n\\nIf the cleanliness of the public spaces is any indicator I would hate to see what the kitchen looks like. I hope the health department makes a surprise visit sometime soon.\\n\\nAVOID AT ALL COSTS. My rating for this place is",

        "I come to Courier Cafe pretty regularly.  Their burger options are a good bargain.  I've always enjoyed their shakes- especially the strawberry or peanut butter.  I prefer to get the specials because I go there so often.  I had a delicious fish fillet sandwich with a HUGE fillet.  Then I got it again, and it was pretty small.  I noticed that sometimes the food isn't very consistent.  \\n\\nThe one thing that might surprise you is that their salad bar is AMAZING.  I get a huge salad with everything on it.

        "You know it's bad when you get in your car practically in tears because of how bad the haircut is. Having curly hair, I've had my fair share of terrible haircuts. The one I had at this salon was among the worst. I explained to the owner of the salon how I wanted my layering, but apparently because I didn't tell him exactly how to cut my hair - since after all, I figured he's the one who should know how to cut hair, including curly hair - it's my fault that I received such a terrible haircut. Sorry, I guess I was too busy watching in horror as he blunt cut horizontal layers into my hair (exactly the opposite of what you're supposed to do with curly hair). The owner clearly has no idea how to cut curly hair. And he's overpriced to boot. The other stylists may give better cuts, but the owner's attitude (\\\"It's not my fault\\\") suggests this salon deserves no one's business.\nSo I would like to give it",

Remember that day I told my friend we should try it. When we arrived to the window where you order food the customer service was horrible and very unfriendly. The guy that was taking our order was just rude and not happy at all. It seem like he was upset about something and was taking it on us. It was our first time being there and I would of thought that the guy would of mention the daily special or even recommend he's favorite dish but instead was so commanding and rude. To make matters worse; we did not get our food until an hour later. The burger was dry and not tasty. There was no love to the burger.

        "It's OK but certainly not great.  We stopped by on a Saturday night around 8.  It was busy and we sat at the sushi bar.  We ordered a couple of rolls and a half dozen nigiri sushi and everything was alright but nothing beyond that.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is old-school neighborhood Japanese like you used to find in LA's Japanese neighborhoods 20 years ago.  Unpretentious and slightly divey.  Service was friendly and efficient from the waitresses.  The sushi chef never made eye contact or spoke to us even though we were sitting right in front of his workspace for 45 minutes.\\n\\nOur platter had perhaps 3 pieces of ginger so I asked the sushi chef for more ginger.  I got maybe another tablespoon of ginger - without a word.  Annoying. The sushi was decently made but nothing terribly special.  The rice was a bit loose/wet, the fish quality was very average, with the exception of the hamachi, which was quite good. The fish portions were also a bit small. When we were there,  they were out of uni. \\n\\nI would stop by if I was in the neighborhood and in the mood for sushi but I wouldn't drive across town for it.  Our bill was $60.00 for two with tip for a moderate amount of sushi, a sake and a beer.\\n\\nAs several other Yelpers have observed, the plethora of 5 star reviews for this joint are baffling to me.  My response would have to be \\\"huh?\\\"  I've been eating sushi for 30 years, been to Japan many times and I know what great sushi is and this isn't even close.  The sushi chef seemed to be mainly making the very non-Japanese rolls (cream cheese, etc.) that are so popular throughout the Valley.\\n\\nIf this is \\\"the best sushi in the Valley\\\" then people in the valley have set the bar a bit too low or else they've never had really good sushi.\nSo I would like to give it",

We've tried just about everything and love each and every dish. Whenever I have the sniffles, I want their Pho that comes with the freshest condiments. Their broth is so flavorful all on its own but blends beautifully to all the condiments.  My personal favorite is the grilled marinated pork/pork chops. Whether it's served with rice or on vermicelli, it's a win! The finished product after grilling is just amazing with its sweet & savory marinade caramelized to perfection.

        "Review: I ate here with my family the other night, 7 of us, for the second time and once again found it to be an exceptional place. With Athena's gone, The Golden Greek in my opinion is the best Greek restaurant in town. Being Greek we don't often go out for Greek, because we can usually get better at home, but TGG is worth going out for. Everything on the menu is solid if not excellent, in our 2 visits we've tried most of the menu. The dishes that stand out the most are the Lamb Shank, it's a special- not sure how often, and the Garithes Yiouvetsi- shrimp baked in tomato sauce w/ feta. I'm not a huge lamb fan ( I never order it, but tasted someone else's in this case), but this shank, slow cooked in a tomato sauce, was wonderfully tender and flavorful, I would go back just for that. The tomato sauce that the shrimp were cooked in was very garlicky and delicious. There were quite a few shrimp in the dish, more then you'd expect for $10.95. The homemade bread is just made for dipping into the leftover tomato sauce. W didn't get dessert this time, but had the rice pudding last time and it was very good as well. Prices are unbelievable as well. Seven of us ate, w/ a couple doggie bags, for $85 including tip, great, great value. One of these days we'll have to try something from the Italian side of the menu. \\n\\nTip- you can view their whole menu on Idine.com\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

It included coffee, make your own waffles, tea, a variety of milk and juice, fruit, hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, pastries, muffins and 3 kinds of cereal.  I had a waffle, coffee and a couple of eggs.  All were tasty. For what we ate for breakfast we probably would have paid $10-15 for at a restaurant so it was a good deal!\\n\\nThe rooms were very clean and had more amenities than I anticipated.  Refrigerator (this was not cold at all when we arrived... I think they had it on the lowest/warmest setting), microwave, coffee maker, blow dryer, iron and ironing board were all provided.   Plenty of towels, toiletries and coffee were also present.\\n\\nI maybe would have liked 4 pillows on the bed instead of 3 but really?  For the price and location Continental Inn couldn't be beat.

        "Review: Taco Bell has really been pimping out their Happier Hour specials with the rolled tacos and $1 drinks. Figured it was a safe spot to grab a late lunch/snack to share with my BF, as we'd planned on a late dinner.\\n\\nOrdered two of the tortilla rolls and a medium Baja Blast, and was really confused when my total came to $6. Figured maybe I was early for the HH pricing or had missed fine print somewhere. Order was out quick via drive thru.\\n\\nAnd when I pulled up at home I realized the mistake. Somehow my order was doubled to two of each of the two tortilla rolls, and a nacho wrap was thrown in. A little frustrating, since that now made a gigantic amount of food instead of a snack, and I hate wasting.\\n\\nBut then I tried the food. And the nacho wrap was about the only thing that was edible. The tortilla rolls were two different types: a chipotle chicken flavor that was somehow just a couple of grilled chicken pieces and a ton of sour cream, then a chili cheese fry flavor that had spicy chili in an amount that seemed like it was trying to cover up the fact that the potatoes were burned. And oh yeah, there was no cheese. Weird.\\n\\nThe Baja Blast was just meh. I'm not a caffeine fan and for some reason I thought this drink was more of an Icee/Slurpee, but it's just a flavored Mountain Dew. \\n\\nEven with the order being butchered and the food being subpar, I didn't expect my stomach to hurt afterward.

We decided to leave and on the way out my wife said, \\\"Thanks for the help\\\".  The worst part the little smart ass dark haired girl blurts out, \\\"Have a nice day\\\" as we were going through the doors.  I went to another place bought a wet suit, spent a little more money but got the service I deserved.  I'm sure the $400 I spent at the other place would have more than covered the salary for all 3 of the employees at Sport Chalet for the day.  I sent an email to customer services and their response, believe it or not, was not to respond.  I will never do business at that place and have been spreading the word of the crappy service and lack of caring for their paying customers they have.  The attitude of \\\"Spend your money and shut up\\\" does not sit well with me.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "The Fiesta Rancho is how do I say it ..... Ghetto. Very Ghetto!! \\nOk so this is part of a Stations Casino, but nothing like Red Rock or even Santa Fe. It is a older and dimly lit casino with lots of smoke, dirt, and of course equally dirty people. I would have to say that this casinos best friend is the bus line and the people who come here from the bus. Most people in this place I believe are spending welfare money and trying to win enough to pay for another week at the budget suites and other low income housing around the surrounding area. \\nThe ceilings are low, the machines are pretty old and there will always be some form of cigarette ash and debris you will remove from your play area. There is a bingo hall which is ok.. however you will smell cigarettes and urinal/fart smells most of the time playing. Even though there is no guarantee of winning coming to any casino, there is a guarantee that your hair and clothing will smell of smoke, and trash when leaving this place. \\nI have never experienced the ice rink, or even stayed at the hotel as a guest... which I would never do even if comped. I have experienced a older woman vomiting in a trash can who was chain smoking and then telling the staff that she had some bad Chinese food. I also experience a woman who was sitting at a Buffalo machine tell me and my girlfriend that another man at the bar was \\\"trying to get at her butt-hole\\\". This place will play 90's hip hop/ popular music and does actually have some really nice employees. Please tip them well as they really deserve it. \\nWith all that said, don't worry about getting dressed up or even doing your hair when coming here as it is totally not needed. If you wanna fit in just wear pajamas, have some smokes, have some gold in your teeth, and of course understand the meaning of lowered expectations. Who knows you might be able to bring a hood rat heffa home with you if thats your thing. Enjoy ! My rating for this place is",

She comes across as smart and interested and for that you overlook the sometimes extremely long wait times. She sent me for a mammogram and part of the scan was unclear so the mammo office wanted me to go back. When I went back, they wanted $380 to do the repeat scan (license to print money, right?) So I said I'd wait for my next free one and told Kimberly Adams what had happened and she didn't seem to have any problem with it while I was in front of her. Then yesterday I got a letter saying I have to find another doctor because I refused to have the follow up mammogram. So beware - if you don't keep her referrals well funded, she'll fire you too.

When it came for the check the meal was not even discounted! I asked for the manager. The manager who looked like \\\"Gomez\\\" (Adams family) said he didn't know that could have happened... and was not very apologetic.

This review fits into the second category.  \\n\\nMany years ago, I used to work in Phoenix, and used to eat lunch at the George and Dragon.  I used to be served promptly, the food was delicious, and I enjoyed the place.  But time has not been kind to this place.  \\n\\nWe went on 03/22/2014\\n\\nWe were kept waiting for 15 minutes before our 'server' brought us menus. \\n\\nWe kept having to ask for refills on our sodas.  We placed our order, and she didn't write anything down, which is actually a peeve of mine.  \\n\\nWe noticed other people came in, were seated, and then because they ordered alcohol were served their meals promptly, and the server scurried over to refill their drinks.  \\n\\nWe called another server over twice to ask for refills, and he couldn't be bothered.  \\n\\nWe ended up waiting almost an hour and a half before we ended up paying for our drinks and leaving.  We complained to the manager but he didn't seem to care either.  We walked out, and warned other patrons going in.  \\n\\nIt is sad that what was a good place has slipped so far, and that the only customers that matter are those that order alcohol. \\n\\nAvoid this place.

However, as adults sometimes it seems that even listening to music can be a hassle to our busy schedules. \\n\\nAs You Wish is a great excuse to go and be a kid again. All those things we do as kids are relaxing and allow us to operate parts of our brains we probably don't get to in our careers/jobs. You don't need to be an artist or have any art skills to do this stuff, just come to have fun. Will your piece come out looking like something you want to put on the mantle? Probably not - but that isn't the point... the point is that you are going to have fun.\\n\\nI can see this as being really fun to do with your kids if they are kind of craft/artsy. I know as a kid, I would have loved doing stuff like this.\\n\\nSo what removes this place from a 5-star? Price and music. Just to come in it is $8 per person and then whatever the cost of the pottery piece you pick. It is a little pricey, but meh, this isn't the place you are going to be making a full dinner set. The in-store music was kind of bleh as well. It may be advisable to come with an MP3 player or something and just zone out in your own music instead of whatever random stuff is playing on their radio.\\n\\nThis is somewhat of a side note, but make sure that you give yourself enough time to paint. Every place you paint has to be painted with 3 coats... and if you have a large piece, then that is going to take forever. Furthermore, if you are planning on something intricate/complicated... just remember that you are going to have to do the exact same design three times. It is more difficult than it seems.\\n\\nOverall, it was fun. I'd like to go back. you can also get their cards and get discounts. Also, look online for coupons. You can get $2 off the sitting-fee or something like that.\n\nStars:",

What should have been an easy fix was a disaster.\\nThe plumber ' Johnny' was totally unprepared when he first arrived and had to go to Home Depot to get parts. Home Depot is about a 5 minute drive from our house but this trip took this guy over an hour. When he finally returned,  he messed around for a short while and determined that he still didn't have what he needed. So, he said that he would have to come back at 5:30 the next day.

Maybe my expectations were too high, but I didn't find any of the dishes to be anything more than average.  The sauce with the crispy & spicy chicken was salty and lacked any real heat.  The chicken itself was prepared fine, but it was not unlike any other chicken breast that has been pounded, breaded in panko and fried.  The green curry was good, but I there was not enough coconut milk in the recipe and the dish was very heavy on the onion.  I also wished there was more of the green curry sauce....lots more.\\n\\nThe service is what redeemed this visit.  We were greeted and then seated immediately after we entered the establishment.  Waters were brought to us with out having to ask, including a small cup with a lid for our daughter.

        "Review: I recently had an awful experience at Big O Tires on Rural Rd. in Tempe. It all started when I brought my car in because it wouldn't start half the time.  After a quick diagnosis the technician said that all I needed to do was replace my starter. I went by the technicians recommendations and a couple hours later my car was ready to be picked up. When I went to start my car and drive away I noticed that there was a grinding sound when I started my car. I asked the technician what that might be and he said it was likely the aftermarket starter that he installed in my car. I wasn't exactly happy with this response and demanded that something be done. That's when Don the less than friendly store manager stepped in and recommended changing the starter out for a different one. At this point I was agitated but I had no other choice but to leave my car at Big O for another day. After the second starter was supposedly installed the sound still never went away. Upon further diagnosis of the car by a reputable auto shop it was found that the flywheel had been broken when the starter was installed by the technician at Big O. I took this up with the technician and Don the store manager and they denied any wrong doing whatsoever. Along with the denials they also had an air of complete disrespect, lack of customer service, and outright rudeness. My only option after that point was to contact the owner of the store who is a guy named Adam. I can now see where Don and the technician got their training because Adam was even more rude and arrogant than either of them and he was also unwilling to be accountable for his shops mess up. At the end of the day I've spent a lot of time and money dealing with this issue. At this point Im better off writing it as a loss and moving on. However, I wanted to make sure everyone out there knows what they're getting into before they spend any money at Big O Tires in Tempe on Rural and Broadway. As a long time resident of Tempe I would suggest using Tempe Auto Repair or Oasis Auto Repair. I...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I waited at this location for hours before I was seen (yes I know they are busy), but it even took long to pick up my computer.  The Scottsdale Quarter got down to the reason why this kept happening (3 times) and wouldn't give up until they found out why.  It turned out to be an external component I was using.  The Genius reps were nice enough but the Chandler location never tried to find out why this kept happening and left me scratching my head.  In my experience, this location just didn't go above and beyond which is what I expect from apple stores.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Although we did determine that she was a bit over the top by the end of our experience.\\n\\nThe parlor looked nothing like the pictures on this website.  The technician was telling us how it was closed and had just reopened.  It had the old time feel of a parlor back in the day but was very empty inside.  The character of the place was great but could use a little TLC.\\n\\nThe menu was very small and hard to read and understand.  It was only posted above the counter and the ice cream technician told us to take a seat.  Good thing I am far sighted!  \\n\\nThe ice cream technician could only take one order at a time.  She made my guest their ice cream first.  I ordered mine, chocolate, and cried vanilla.  She didn't listen at all.  I didn't return it because we had already been there for about 30 minutes and were running late at this point.\\n\\nI gave them a 2 star instead of 1 because the actual flavor of the ice cream was pretty good, vanilla or chocolate.  I adde strawberries to mine and received the typical strawberry topping.

        "Review: Too bad there's not an option for no stars. The only thing more atrocious than the fungal smell and lack of working equipment at this gym is the customer service. Today I cancelled my entire family's membership because I've had enough. After touring three other local gyms - I'm willing to pay the extra money to switch to one that gives a crap about its customers. Having had my membership for 11 years it's a sad move, especially since I pay peanuts - but it's just NOT worth the headache of working out here. When the manager accused me of lying about my child's age, I went back home and brought back her birth certificate to prove I wasn't lying, and still I remained a customer. When the manager bitched at me about not answering the overhead page when it CLEARLY states on the app (in permanent marker) that they MUST call me on my cellular because I am hard of hearing and I run plugged into my iPhone, I stayed a member. Now they're saying I haven't paid up my account even though I have a RECEIPT in my possession from last week, when I paid in person. If this is how they treat loyalty, I'd hate to see how they piss on everyone else. Take my advice - pay the extra few bucks and switch to Gold's, LA, or ANYWHERE else.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: While a single visit is not enough to justify an excellent or terrible rating, I was impressed with my recent encounter here. My dog had become very sick in a short amount of time and I called several vets who had no opening until later that afternoon. Crossroads was able to get me in right away and they were very helpful and thorough. The vet tech/front office employee was obviously very busy but she stayed polite and professional the entire time.\\n\\nThe doctor did not simply tell me what he was going to do, but he discussed the options with me and let me decide on the care that my dog received based on price and desired level of care. They were very efficient; it took less than thirty minutes from the time I arrived until my dog was treated and we were out the door. The price that I paid for this care was reasonable, even less than I was expecting. I am grateful that they were able to help us so quickly and thoroughly.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The counter girl was having trouble telling them apart and I got one of each instead of two almond. No big deal, I told her it was ok and to just guess when she was trying to figure them out since I enjoy chocolate croissants too.\\n\\nNow for the bad. I was super excited to tear into the baguette I got but the texture is all off. Don't get me wrong, its passable bread, but definitely shouldn't be called a baguette. The crust isn't crackly, the crumb is dense, the whole thing a little too chewy. It still scratches the bread itch but... that loaf ain't right.\\n\\nThe plain croissant, unlike its sweet cousins, suffers from the same problems a lot of American croissants do, being doughy and stolid and not flaky at all. Better suited to cradle some various fillings and be stuffed in a lunchbox than to be enjoyed on its own.\\n\\nSo overall I will probably be going back if I have a craving for sweets, but I'll have to find somewhere else with a baguette that suits my picky picky needs.\n\nReview rating:",

She never asked us to get up or explained the \\\"unwritten rules\\\" to us.

        "This place is seriously awesome. You get a bucket of peanuts to start (feel free to throw the shells on the floor) and the service is super friendly. Maybe because he was our friend, but I think they're friendly with other people too. We had the soft pretzel appetizer and my mouth just started watering just from typing that. So delicious. i had a chicken sandwich that was decent - a bit big and overwhelming for my taste but definitely tasted great. But the drinks - mmm. They had a whipped cream flavored vodka and put that in rootbeer to make the most amazing \\\"root beer float\\\" ever. Loved it. I also really like places that have cute specials for every day of the week, I like that feel of a place that you could go several times in a week and have a good time every time. If you're looking for a chill place to eat, hang out, have a few drinks this should be on your list.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: We tried this for office lunch as a change from Chipotle, since the menu has some interesting options that Chipotle lacks (like fish!) and the dieter (not me) was impressed with the low calorie counts.\\n\\nNext time, I'm going to suggest we all bond by getting root canals together.\\n\\nCredit the low calorie counts to tiny portions, so figure your meal will cost the same as at Chipotle, but you'll get maybe 2/3 as much food.\\n\\nThe one counter clerk correctly noted that, since I was clutching a list of items, I was a captive customer. She did the obvious thing for corporate efficiency and kept me waiting (and waiting and waiting), then was snippy while taking the order (after having been sweet to the family ahead of me). She was even snippier to the person after me, so I guess it's not difficult to be inadequate to the glories that are the Blue Burrito.\\n\\nThe carnitas in the street tacos were dry and flavorless, so it's a good thing the portions were so small, as it would have been unkind to ask me to chew through more of that. Refried pinto beans tasted as if a box of black pepper had been spilled in the pot, but the rice was quite good. I can also summon mild enthusiasm for the chips, though the \\\"hot\\\" salsa also tasted more of black pepper than of jalapeno.\\n\\nSo if you're looking to pay $7-$10 a meal for small portions of mediocre (but varied!) food dished up at low speed in a mildly hostile but industrial-chic environment, this Blue Burrito will be your go-to lunch spot in Scottsdale.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: Hotel is okay, but not great. \\n1. You enter the hotel on a main floor with a security guard then ride the elevator up to registration. It's not the warmest or most welcoming feeling.\\n\\n2. The main guests are those receiving treatment at the University of Pittsburgh hospital, so much of the hotel caters to the hospital staff or patients. Many hospital staff park in the hotel lot and ride a UPMC shuttle to the hospital, and I honestly am not a fan of non-hotel traffic at any hotel. Also, even though I made a reservation on the shuttle I missed it because I was a minute late and the hospital patients where on a tight schedule.The shuttle runs every 45 minutes, so I had to call a cab and that was annoying. I was late, but had someone previously told me the patients were dependent on it as well I would have understood the need for a super prompt schedule. \\n\\n3. The hotel is an older property in a neighborhood with very little immediately available. You have to either ride the hotel shuttle or drive. But all the drives are short. \\n\\nThe one thing this hotel did well was have very nice staff. The only hiccup came when the night attendant scheduled a cab for me, but the cabby misunderstood the pickup times. Everything was also very clean and in order while I stayed there.\\n\\nAgain this hotel is OK, but not my favorite Residence Inn.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Well I went to try the wall and feel like I got hit with it. I did not go for the dim sum. Not a huge fan of dim sum. We went to have something on the regular menu. The restaurant is huge. It was busy the entire time we were there. Many of the patrons were Asian which in my opinion is always a very good sign when dinning in an oriental restaurant. The staff is friendly and very attentive. I think we had 5 different people serving us. \\n\\nI went to try the walnut shrimp with mayonnaise. Some call it crystal shrimp others mayonnaise shrimp. One of my fellow yelpers had mentioned it was her favorite here. So I had to try it out. Well it was ok, the walnuts were odd almost praline. The shrimp seemed on the verge of being undercooked and a couple of the shrimp were not cleaned well. That just stopped me in my tracks and I couldn't finish. I guess I have been spoiled by my beloved Gina (Big Wong) her walnut shrimp with mayonnaise was incredible! \\n\\nWe also tried the fried rice and was not impressed here either it was very bland no flavor at all. They served a mountain of it but it just didn't have any taste to it. The egg rolls were crisp yet greasy, they were small and the inside was mush almost liquefied. My friend experienced the same problem with her dish under seasoned. \\n\\nIt was a little like dinning in an Asian old folk's home; you know no salt everything bland, edible just not appetizing. : ) I really wanted to like this place. I will not be back. My rating for this place is",

        "Last year I gave it 5 stars, this year, 3.  The chef has just gotten lazy - they have gone from a full menu full of fabulous choices to 2 set menus - a 3 Course at $65 (granted, selections within this, but nothing enticed at all...) and a 7 course, all if which sounded delicious, for $125.  Since we are not allowed foie gras in California, I'm on a mission on my yearly visit to Wisconsin...  The usual plan is to sit at the bar and let the excellent and knowledgeable bartenders guide us through wine, drinks and food for dinner 2 nights in a row at L'Etoile, as their fish selections were varied and always wonderful.  Usually only one incredible foie gras starter, but the helpful Bartenders would have a word and the chef would create something new, different and exciting for our return the next night to accompany one of the other fish dishes we were dying to try...  That is no longer possible with this set menu.  I'm normally all for Prix fix, IF you have a choice of that or the usual menu.  2 Set Menus only?  Not happy, and neither are some of the other regulars we met last night.  \\n\\nSo, onto the menu which granted, we shared, but still incredibly puny portions.  Montauk Grilled Scallops - was one of the teensiest scallop singular I have ever seen sliced into 4 slivers.  Had to put on reading glasses to find its accompaniments and impossible to experience all together.  Foie gras 2 ways and all to myself as husband knows better... - one teensy pear \\\"cracker\\\" with buttery heaven on it - would have killed for a bowl of this, a 1\\\" seared piece in a duck reduction that was very interesting in a good way... Would have killed for more than 3 little bites of this too.  I was able to accompany with a lovely glass of Sauternes, but the foie was gone well before the wine.  Lobster was small but yummy.  Lamb \\\"Rack\\\" - ha... Not memorable.  Eye of Rib - again, meh.  Hooks 12 year cheddar with apple - I missed the usual calcium lactate crystals I love to find in the Hooks 12 year, so this was a letdown.  Pumpkin...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

We had a male waiter who handled our giant group with ease and was very pleasant.\\n\\nThis time, we had a girl serving us. I did not catch her name, but she was short, kinda squat and had darker hair. She seemed to have a bit of an attitude, and was nowhere to be found when we needed refills, dressing, or the check. Another server also delivered all our beer from the bar, so she must have really been pulling a vanishing act.\\n\\nAs for the food... We had chicken alfredo and a pizza. The alfredo sauce was ridiculously salty and the noodles undercooked. The pizza was lukewarm when it arrived. The crust was insanely chewy to the point of making your jaw hurt. The only good thing about the meal was the ranch dressing.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: Great back patio, despite the rather angry staff.  Apparently it was a bad night for staff at the TST.  It was chilly outside, so there were a couple of tiki torches lit.  We stepped off the porch and down to the patio by the ping pong tables, and there was an unlit torch, so I decided to go light it from the one on the patio myself.  As I was about to light it, someone grabbed the stand, and I wheeled around to see one of the staff with an angry face ask me \\\"What are you doing? The fire marshal told us yesterday that we couldn't have these, and now you're dripping oil all over the patio.\\\"  Now I understand that this guy probably has to deal with lots of drunken crazies with pyro fetishes (after all there's a table at the outside bar that has a fire pit in it), and he needs to be firm to get his point across, but I did not at all appreciate that tone when there were clearly other tiki torches lit around the porch, and there was not a drop of oil on the ground under the torch that I was holding.  Ok, whatever, \\\"I'm so sorry, I'll just sit down\\\".  Three minutes pass, and the same guy walks out to light the said tiki torch.  He then pats my arm and says \\\"There you go, honey, your torch is now lit.\\\"  Please don't touch me, particularly if you don't know me, and you were just reprimanding me with angry eyes.  I know you're trying to make nice, but the touching only makes it creepy.  5 minutes later, a different guy on the patio who was smoking and talking on his cell phone closes his phone forcefully while uttering a choice expletive and walks up to the tiki torch, blowing it out with wet, smoky breath.  He then proceeds to walk up to the porch and blow them all out, and recruit the original employee from my story, and they carry all the now blown-out tiki torches back to the shed where no one can mess with them.  Guess the fire marshal did call.\\n\\nWhatever, I understand, just wish they'd had their story straight.

Chicken Quesadilla is awesome (I have ordered it as both an appetizer and entree in the same meal before, it is that good), colorful waitstaff, good margaritas and large selection of mexican beer at a good price.  A few months ago they had a waiter that looked and acted like captain Jack Sparrow and somehow pulled it off (although he kept calling me darling).  No reservations, be prepared to wait (only downside).  Skip the queso.  Fish taco is also solid.  Make sure you don't go on a gallery crawl night or it will be a 2+ hour wait.

We all enjoyed our drinks, including my husband's and my dirty martinis. My only gripe was that they didn't come with the blue cheese olives mentioned on the menu already in them. Instead, the server brought them to our table and then asked if we wanted the olives. \\n\\nI still don't think I'd linger at Merc Bar for hours (unless I was drinking Red Bull drinks to stay awake!) because I find the vibe just a bit too underground for my tastes, but I will definitely be back for a pre or post dinner drink.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nSo I have been in the market for a small pocket hand gun and a tactical shot gun, I have been researching on line and pricing. But I wanted to check the firearms out in person and get a feel for them and buy locally if possible. A friend of mine recommended Pistol Parlor in Mesa. 1st off its off the beaten path which I don't mind, I understand business to keep prices down sometimes you have store fronts in less desirable locations to help deliver savings to the customers. The shop is off southern and country club in a strip mall with many empty store fronts, it's a little hard to see from street. Once inside the store it is well stocked but very small and narrow. However they probably have what you're looking for from firearms to ammo and accessories. The layout is pretty standard all firearms behind the counter and 3 employees behind the counter. No one greats you or asks if they can help you find something. I located the Ruger LCP 380 in the glass case myself, asked the employee if I may check it out, he pulls it out of the case and just hands it to me. Correct me if I'm wrong don't you always clear a firearm insuring there's no round in chamber, ok whatever maybe it's just me being a former Marine. I inspect weapon and price tag. Its $50 more than the average price I've seen online and other shops, hmmmm.... So much for less desirable location meaning cost savings for me. I then ask to see the Mossberg 500 12 gauge tactical shot gun, immediately I get sticker shock they're priced $100 more than average price  I've seen. Ok so they're very impressed with their guns and I'm not. So I decided I will not be buying my firearms from them. So not to make my trip completely worthless I grab a box of 40 S & W ammo its priced a couple bucks higher than average but whatever I'm here so I'm going to buy. Mean while I'm browsing there's another customer a female there inquiring on hand guns on what they would recommend for her. The employees behind the counter answer her questions but she decides she needs to do more...\n\nReview rating:",

One thing to know beforehand is they do not take reservations and they pack the place on Friday nights. Expect to wait a while. This is a nice little neighborhood bar on the east side of Madison that has a huge following. They offer several different types of fish for the Friday fish fry. Fried or Baked Cod, Perch, or Walleye. I went with the fried cod which was absolutely delicious. I couldn't turn down the garlic chili fries or their home made chili. Needless to say I could have used a wheel chair for the way out! It was by far one of the better fish fry joints to go to in town and I will for sure be back. My only complaint with the place was that they don't take reservations and they won't do carry out during lent (due to an overwhelming amount of business) but it's good to see a business that does so much business they have to turn some away.\n\nStars:",

My big issue is that the employees stand directly outside and smoke. This looks awful and smells awful- especially when it blows in the front door choking you while you wait in line. I have no idea how they manage to keep the clothing from reeking (or maybe I've just gotten lucky). I could certainly come here more than I do, but I despise walking through a cloud of smoke every time.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nI decided to branch out and try a new Korean place.  I wanted to see how good/bad my usual place (Cho Dang) was.  I wasn't surprised to find out that Cho Dang is in a league of its own when it comes to Korean BBQ in CHandler.  Takamatsu was as underwhelming as it gets.\\n\\nThe decor is like a cafeteria.  Patrons are very loud.  It seems that everyone goes there for the all you can eat sushi.  The person who sat us thought we were there for it and our server did a triple take when we didn't have anything filled out on the sushi form.  Call me a sushi snob all you want, but I don't go to a Korean place to get my fix, and if I did, I wouldn't go to an all you can eat place.  I'm not trying to maximize calories, I am trying to maximize flavor.\\n\\nWe ordered two dishes we routinely get at Cho Dang, Bulgogi and another dish. we had some miso soup that was included which was good.  That is literally impossible to screw up because it comes from either a powder or a cube.  No points for not screwing that up.  \\n\\nOut came the sides and the dishes.  This is when it got very disappointing.  The sides were inedible.  Most were very bland while others were just bad.  I don't think any side was edible.  The bulgogi was decent, but still not as good as I'm used to.  The other dish was poorly executed and just tasted bad.  \\n\\nOverall, the place was really bad.  They deserve 1 star but if I could I would be generous and give them a 1.5 stars because we ate the bulgogi and didn't leave completely unsatisfied.  I'll never go back considering there is Korean food that is in a different league just down the street on Ray and Arizona.  \\n\\nThis place looked like a chinese buffet, and the food execution was on the same level.  I didn't see a single Korean there eating which is a bad sign.  I saw a ton of wannabe sushi eaters, a few SE-Asians and several old people. \\n\\nI gave it a shot once and won't be back.  Worst Korean food I've ever eaten without question.  Yelp reviewers are really starting to get a bad rap with me.  If this...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "I love Zimbrick Acura. I love every Zimbrick in the city for that matter. I have never had a bad experience here. I have come here for every little item I needed done and have never felt cheated or had the blanket pulled over my eyes. There have been a few things where I was expecting a HUGE bill for things like the stabilizer for my rear suspension that had been slightly bent. I bought a new one and brought it in thinking well Labor will be $100. Zimbrick got me right in, said it would take an hour, had it out in half an hour and didn't charge me a dime. Another time I have come in expecting to replace all my breaks and rotors and Zimbrick saved me about $300 without having to replace everything. \\n\\nI have worked with a few guys here and they have ALL been extremely professional and treated me like family. The guy I usually go to even just chats with me about cars and such while i'm having service done. (Mainly getting my oil changed). The facility itself is nothing less than perfection, in my opinion, when it comes to dealerships. It is clean, well layed out, they have a great lounge with a Big Screen TV, leather chairs, FREE WIFI, and the best of all... Free Starbucks Coffee. I have had nothing but great experiences from Zimbrick and not just Zimbrick Acura. However, BECAUSE of Zimbrick Acura I expect to buy another Acura and stay with them for a VERY very long time. Thank you Zimbrick Acura! YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST.\\n\\nP.S. When I was having major service done they let me choose what I wanted to drive while I waited for the day.  NOBODY does that. So I had some fun with a brand new TL one day on a secret \\\"test\\\" road Zimbrick European showed me when I was buying my car just off Rimrock Road.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

We went during lunch time and I was sorely disappointed by everything from the rude reception the taste in my mouth hours later, aside from the free crackers that come on every table.  The sushi options sound nice on the menu, but the quality of the fish was not high enough for how long the fish had obviously been sitting in the back. (The freshest sushi I've found, at a low price, has been at Tokyo and Whole Foods, though the latter puts way too much avocado in everything) Finally, when we went to pay the man at the counter was kind of snippy for no reason, again.

The first thing that bugged me was that the young man at the window did not have his LONG hair in neither a hair net NOR tied back. If females are required to tie their hair back in the food industry, same should go for males. I ignored this and waited for my order, which was a chicken sandwich (keep in mind I did not order beef for personal and religious reasons). When I got home to unwrap my sandwich, everything fell out... everything that I did NOT order.. jalape\\u00f1os.. an extra patty of BEEF... which was just made sloppy. To top it off, a BITE WAS TAKEN OUT OF MY SANDWICH. I REPEAT, A BITE WAS TAKEN OUT OF BOTH PATTIES, THE LETTUCE, TOMATOES, AND BREAD. This place is disgusting and I will never be back. They were closing in 5 minutes, so rather than driving back in anger, I called and the lady who took my order apologized and told me it was a sandwich she made for a co-worker and accidentally switched my sandwich for his. If you're going to work in a fast- paced, fast- food atmosphere... double check your orders and put a customer before an employee. The ONLY reason I rated this 1 star is because I cannot post my experience as a review without giving at least one. If it were up to me, I would give negative stars. Don't ever come here, because I will never be back.\n\nReview rating:",

It took so long to get through Immigration and Customs, I swear the employees were on some kind of slow motion drugs.  We were about to miss our flight- in fact someone had to call the gate to ask them to wait for us.  When we saw the mile long line for security, we panicked.  I thought if I asked the security man very nicely if we could go to the head, since the plane was waiting, perhaps he would help us.  WRONG!!!  He was the rudest, most ignorant employee I encountered in the entire airport.   We ran our asses off and got to our gate just as they were closing the doors.  Luckily they let us board.

        "Review: I've been visiting V's on and off since they first opened in 1999. For a while I thought that I needed to pay a Scottsdale stylist big bucks to cut my hair but as I get older I've come back to the realization that a good barber is all I need.\\n\\nI'm not sure why I ever strayed because I've never had a bad haircut at V's. I've gotten a shave here as well, although I tend to think a straight razor shave is overrated, and I also really appreciate the fact that they offer a shoeshine service. In fact I've stopped in many times just to have a polish put on when I'm headed to an interview or an important meeting.\\n\\nCurrently I'm working in California so I only get back to Phoenix about one weekend a month, but if I can make it work, I try and hit up V's to get my haircut.\\n\\nToday I took my two boys with me so we could all get our haircuts. As always the atmosphere was great and the service was excellent. It's fun to see all the other fathers with their sons and I know that when I move back to Arizona permanently this will become a regular event for my children and I.\\n\\nIf you need a great place to get your haircut, get a shave, get your shoes shined or just to hang out with the guys, head over to V's - you won't regret it!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I was in this shop once when I was picking up my girlfriend. She was still finishing her final paper after a 2 week crash course that kicked off her graduate school education. Mind you I said grad school, yes I am a fully grown man in his early thirties with a girlfriend who is in grad school. Not a 18 year old undergrad with no money. I was just killing time and saw this shop. I stopped in to browse, as I was browsing I knelt down to get a better look at some books on the bottom shelf grabbed one to figure out what exactly it was,  this takeing maybe a full 10 seconds. Mind you I'm kneeling (not a comfortable position that I would stay in for long) and the guy behind the counter comes tells me that your not allowed to sit on the floor and read. I look at him like Huh?! I explain I am kneeling and wasn't even reading just looking. He points to a sign and says \\\"those are the rules\\\" rather rudely. I take the 3 books I had in hand (and was planning on buying) put them back on the shelf and walk out. I haven't been treated that bad in a store since I was 12. Judging from the other reviews this guy isn't very friendly and his store is kinda dirty. I mean really when was the last time you dusted dude? Your little model cars on the wall were filthy.

By the way, I do mean LITTLE, I've seen someone's bathroom bigger than this joint.\\n\\nLet's be real peeps... this place is put in the \\\"Dive Bar\\\" category for a reason.  Besides, the place is called \\\"Jeff's Bucket Shop,\\\"  I seriously for the longest time don't even know of its existance... or what the heck Jeff is selling by the bucket, or if Jeff is trying to sell buckets, or who the heck is Jeff?!  So yes, there maybe a little weird smell (frankly I don't even pay attention to it, and I have a super good nose, but I do have high tolerance for \\\"weird smell\\\" courtesy of my heritage lol).  My personal suggestion is stop asking what the heck that smell is (because you probably don't want to know) and just keep drinking.\\n\\nI have been here mostly on Fridays and they have karaoke.  I think they have karaoke on other nights too.  Not sure if they always have the same host, and if he is the regular, let me warn you, he doesn't play... he will gong you off that stage like you're on Apollo if you are seriously tone-deaf.  \\n\\nThis place gets packed.  So if you have issues with being too crowded, well... not sure if you want to sardine your way into here on a weekend night.  And again, if you are the high-er maintanence type, you may want to stick with your \\\"safer\\\" choices and go next door or across the street or uptown.

        "I finally made it to Mi Patio last Friday after working up an appetite checking out First Friday. The service was impeccable- chips and salsa brought out right away and replenished as often as needed. I am a salsa fanatic so I loved the fact that they refilled my salsa without it even being totally empty- thats amazing!!\\n\\nWe started with a cheese quesadilla, because whats better than melted cheese on a tortilla? And I tried a margarita on the rocks and really liked the taste of it.  Maybe not the strongest thing, but at least it wasn't loaded with sweet n sour mix. Blech!\\n\\nWe had all but decided what to order when we found out the menu had another side to it- so many choices! I went with a combo plate with a chile relleno, cheese enchilada, beef taco and rice n beans. It was a feast! Everything was wonderful, even the rice. I liked that the chile relleno wasn't battered and fried but simply wrapped in a corn tortilla and stuffed with gooey white cheese. JD had the chicken burro because of the reputation it had earned from other Yelpers and he was very happy with his choice. The burrito had moist, flavorful chunks of chicken that tasted incredible.\\n\\nWe were also totally impressed with the prices! This place is cheap and doesn't skimp at all on food, salsa or service! I can't wait to come back!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: Food is absolutely delicious and also well priced considering the fresh homemade ingredients and the certainly ample portions! Went with my mom and we each started with the soup of the day - lentil - which was creamy and flavorful. It came to the tank at the proper temperature which is important to me with soup. I HAD to try their tzatziki so I ordered a gyro plate (boring, I know) but the lamb was absolutely amazing and very flavorful. The fresh pita was warm and fluffy and I also loved the taboule on the side. The tzatziki, while fresh tasting, is not the best I've ever had. It was good though. My dish also had rice pilaf on the side which I found to be a bit bland but my mom enjoyed it. \\n\\nMy mom got the special of the day - slow cooked lamb shank. It literally fell off of the bone. She loved it and also enjoyed her fresh pita and grilled veggie medley that came with the dinner. She did not like her rice, but I loved it so we traded. Hers was a mixture of rice, pine nuts, and ground beef. Great!\\n\\nWould go here again if I was in the area. Place is very cute inside. Only negative for me for the waiter/possibly owner who stood next to the table while we counted our money for the bill and discussed the tip. Very rude and not appreciated. Otherwise a good experience.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I just went there tonight with my dad my brother, and his wife.  My dad, brother and I love trying new places and watch the FOOD Network regularly.  My dad had been wanting to try this place out for awhile now - because he saw an episode on Diner's/Drive-Ins & Dives.  He had wanted to go for this past father's day but thank god we opted to cook him a meal at home....\\n\\nWe all love mexican food and we have no idea how this place made it on that show - either Guy (Food Network host) has never eaten decent mexican food in his life or they were paid.  \\n\\nThe food was REALLY bad - I'd rather take my chances eating off a street vendor in Mexico City.  We were fine that it was inside the gas station (which was very clean).  But, the food was just horrible.....I ordered the El Pastor plate - pork in a red chile sauce with rice & beans.  The pork, in small chunks and very greasy, had a horrible taste I can't even describe.  I had my dad try some and my sister-in-law and my dad deemed it inedible.  \\n\\nMy Dad, poor thing, ordered the fish tacos.  He took one bite and almost spit it out - and then proceeded to dig around in the tacos to survey the contents.  What was supposedly fish, although smelled like fish, COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FISH.  It looked like little rings with a skin of some sort, cut in 1/2\\\" pieces - with the flesh pointing into the center of the rings - kind of the like the \\\"choke\\\" of an artichoke.... So, my brother insisted he return it and get something else (to the obvious distain of the girl working the counter).  He, reluctant to complain, ended up getting some steak tacos instead - which were better but still not good.  He didn't eat more than 1 or 2 bites.  \\n\\nMy brother got the carne asada and his wife got the chicken chimichanga.  They were both edible but nothing memorable.  The rice and beans were just okay.  Nothing special there either.  \\n\\nSo, this place was a TOTAL FLOP in our books.... DO NOT GO THERE!!!!\\n\\nFor the money, you're better off going to Carolina's on Cave Creek &...\nSo I would like to give it",

Today, for example, they had blah Shepherd's Pie (soup to put over potatoes), blah Scalloped Potatoes, blah Penne Arrabbiata, blah macaroni & cheese, three kinds of blah focaccia bread, blah low-fat cottage cheese, & so on.

It is definitely on par with any of the other similar restaurants I have Yelped.\\n\\nVery wide menu, which includes several vegetarian options as well as the usual carnivore stuff. The chips brought to our table were warm and fresh, along with two bowls of salsa. The mild one was just that. Mild. No spice at all. The hot was well peppery. I was able to mix one into the other to make one that was \\\"just right\\\" though it was still not the chunky style I prefer.\\n\\nThe food was served promptly and accurately. The rice was fresh and not crunchy or stale at all.

        "Review: Friendly staff, good food, but they cannot simply get our order right...ever. I am not exaggerating and its not just sometimes, it is every time. Whether it be as simple as forgetting extra dressing on the side, or an extra baguette we paid for, all the way up to forgetting the roast beef in my Asiago roast beef sandwich! We have even had pieces of a plastic bag in the soup we ordered. I've eaten at other Paneras across the country and I do not recall as many issues as this particular location has, which leads me to believe poor management is responsible. We have brought it to several different manager's attention, and the issues are still ongoing. So beware if ordering takeout, be prepared to double check your order, even unwrapping your sandwich to make sure they didn't forget the meat. If dining in, chances are you will be asking the server to bring you an item they forgot to include, but at least they can correct that while you are there.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

They don't serve food which can be annoying for an early evening show. Also, depending on the night, this place can turn into an utter sausage fest with all kinds of creeps creepin' up all over any undefended lady.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Not without its inconsistencies, the Scottsdale Hilton Resort is an elegant and beautifully appointed hotel in a location convenient to both Old Town and the local highways.  \\n\\nThe front desk and concierge service are absolutely top-notch, customer-centric and on their game.  The little details are tended to; good coffee and flavored waters in the main lobby, outstanding poolside bar service, thick cotton towels and robes and clean public areas among them.  In fact, so much attention is given to hosing-down the outdoor concrete that you would never suspect that the area has a water shortage.\\n\\nRooms were right-sized, neither spacious, nor cramped, and attractively furnished.  Water pressure was good on the first floor, but temperatures were extremely inconsistent and variable.  Beds appeared to be a bit old and not as comfortable as in most Hilton properties.  The available television stations were at least a decade behind current tastes, but high-end LG flat screens were appreciated.  WiFi bandwidth was outstanding, and didn't require constantly repeating a log-in process.\\n\\nThe Scottsdale Hilton Resort has two restaurants, an independent Fleming's (a top-tier chain steakhouse) and their own Blue Fire.  While I found the food at the Blue Fire to be adequate, I believe that the other members of my family will disagree.  Service is amateurish and slow, while prices are high.  No worries, however, as there are dozens of places to eat within an easy walking radius.\\n\\nWe checked-in as a family of four, yet received only three sets of towels.  The front desk was apologetic, and promised that additional towels would be delivered shortly.  Three hours later we called again and the extra towels arrived within five minutes.  Yet for each of the two remaining days of our stay housekeeping brought only three sets.  It is an attention to details like this which separate \\\"very good\\\" from \\\"great\\\" motels.\\n\\nThere is plenty of free parking, but the campus is very large and long walks may be necessary if you don't...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: The hubby and I were out running errands and time was flying buy, we were starving, and I have been on a constant craving for Italian subs (thanks Jersey Mikes!) so I said lets go to streets, we were in that shopping center anyway... I remembered about six years ago, a friend who worked there hooked me up with an Italian sub, and I remembered it being good. I also remembered having pizza from some other Streets location at some point and it was fresh and good also... I didn't feel very skeptical. We were sat but it seemed like we were forgotten for a while, it took like ten minutes before our waitress came (there were only two or three other tables sat, and at least four servers there). I ordered the sub, hubby ordered medium wings. They brought the complementary bread and I realized it was about to be a sucky meal. The bread was old, the marinara was nasty. I got my Caesar about another ten minutes latter, it was also nasty, the dressing was like Kraft or something bottled and low quality, there was the most powerful BO smelling red onion slice on top. The wings and sandwich didn't take as long... The wings were like precooked Tyson frozen wings with some kind of weird glaze, flavored like buffalo sauce. It didn't even look like real wings. The sandwich was soooooooooooooo gross. The bread was gross, the dressing was flavorless... I hate spending money (yeah it wasn't that much, only a $20 lunch for two, but still...) on food that is nasty. Even the water was nasty. It makes me so mad! Only good thing, our waitress was nice.  We should have went to Greek Corner, where I know the food is GOOD!  Streets needs to make their food fresh to start improving...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Once you get past the fact that you're surrounded by graves and, well, dead bodies, you realize that you're in the middle of a gorgeous outdoor area, smack in the middle of Charlotte. \\n\\nI go running here a few times a week, and I'm not alone. There are great concrete paths that weave in and around the grounds. One loop is about 1.5 miles by the way, if you're trying to get a sense of how much ground you're covering. It can be hilly at times, so be warned. \\n\\nElmwood is also popular with dog walkers, although there was an issue a few months back about dogs being off their leashes, but that has since been settled. Most people have their dogs on leashes now, although a few stragglers are yet to get the with program. If you're looking to socialize your dog or meet other dog owners, Elmwood after 5 pm is a good place to head. \\n\\nBut more than anything, it's just a nice place to take a quiet walk (again, assuming you're able to ignore the graves or appreciate them). Take a walk and check out how long some of them have been there, and the various passages they have on them. It's actually a really cool walk to take.\n\nReview rating:",

Cooking below medium-well is against the law here, but the cooks at the Penguin do not need to press every bit of juice out that they can.  The fried pickles are too salty -- meaning pickles are salty enough on their own, so the batter and dressing should have no salt or at least low salt.  Almost all food is luke-warm.

        "Review: This would be my second brake service with them. Both times they did a great job in a timely matter. Both times the guys were polite and answered all questions without being annoyed or trying to sell me something I didn't need. After the inspection of coarse they came back with some things my vehicle needed. To be expected, that's what they do. I am not a mechanic but i know the basics.The recommendations were legit. Although I passed on all and just had the brakes done cause that's all the budget would allow. I have been happy both times and those times were on two different vehicles about 5 years apart. Fair price,good service. going back in a few weeks to get the rear brakes done next. Thanks guys.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Was in Phoenix and decided to stop off at Filiberto for a quick lunch before I had to catch a flight home. \\n\\nI would best describe Filiberto's as a fast food joint a set up from Taco Bell. Basically it's a fast food joint with lots of mexican fast food items such as Burritos, Tacos, and Tortas. Prices here are a bit more than you would expect from a fast food joint and you're looking around $4 - $8 depending upon what you order. \\n\\nI decided to go with the Carne Asada Tortas Combo. I was hoping to be in an out but the food took a long time to cook. I probably waited about 10 minutes before the food came out. The Tortas was a good size and was a mix of good and bad. The Carne Asada had good flavoring but was tough and the guacamole while good was layered on there thick. It was to the point where I got a guacamole torta with some carne asada topping to it. The fries here - well frozen Costco fries. \\n\\nAs to ratings, Filiberto is ok. It fills a need and nothing more. Overall you can do better but if in a jam and looking for someplace, will work. 3 Star rating for Filiberto's.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nI've seen Ana 3 times for a total of 5 piercings. First my belly button in December of 2010. I'm an incredible needle-phobe and have been since I was a kid but through her incredible \\\"chair-side\\\" manner, she got me calmed down enough to bring my anxiety down to a manageable level. She was very calming, took her time and joked with me until my adrenaline was down. She was incredibly careful in lining up the piercing which was important to me since I've had friends who had crooked ones or ones that didn't heal right due to being improperly lined up. My ring fell out and needed to be replaced some months later and when I went to get one, the employee who sold me the ring just guessed on the size and sold me one that was wayyyyy too long. When I went back and talked to Ana about it, I was perfectly willing to pay for a new ring but Ana refitted me with a proper size and installed it all for free even though they don't do refunds or exchanges on jewelry as a policy. She accepted responsibility for the employee's mistake and completely remedied the problem. In July of 2011 she did 2 helix piercings for me which was a pretty specialized project. I wanted an industrial but she explained that my ear is the wrong shape to accomodate it so she worked with me to create what we termed a \\\"faux-dustrial\\\" where she lined up 2 piercings as she would for an industrial but put two separate barbells in the piercings, just lined up to look like they should be connected. She said that once they healed we could put a bent industrial barbell in to accomodate the shape of my ear. When piercing the top piercing, the skin on the top of my ear rolled and caused the piercing to be set at an awkward angle that would have caused problems later. Not only did she notice right away, she removed it and repierced it. She wanted it done perfectly so that I wouldn't have problems down the line. While I wasn't happy about having a third needle stuck through me, it was not her fault that this happened, it's just one of those things that happens...\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nThere's a reason this place only averages 2.5 stars.\\n\\nThis is what I consider a boaters paradise..... It is where boaters come to watch and to be seen. It is common to have quite a few beers while watching the boats try to aimlessly dock in a narrow slip with amateur boaters.  I will refer to this event as the bumper boats at T-Bones.\\n\\nI am perplexed at the statement that they take reservations, but they do not do call ahead seating.  Tonight, was only a 5 min wait, so I was able to entertain myself by watching two boaters trying to dock their boat.  (very cheap entertainment if you ask me)\\n\\nNow for the T-Bones review.\\nI have been craving oysters lately, and prefer Oyster Rockefeller, but since this was not offered, I opted for the Angels on Horseback...it is bacon wrapped oysters deep fried on a bed of rice w/ a side of oriental sauce.  I give this a 1/5 stars,yes one star.  The bacon was burnt (black) and the rice was very dry and hard.  The sauce did not really help, but it did add flavor to a very bland dish.  Definitely not worth $9.99 ( I have added a picture) \\n\\nNow for for the Burgers / Chicken sandwiches.  The burger was very nice, juicy, the provolone cheese was properly melted and the bacon was cooked perfectly.  The Chicken Sandwich, which I requested plain, was very juicy, moist, and without any extra help, from condiments, lettuce etc, was very tasty and flavorful.  \\n\\nNow you may ask,how can bacon be burnt black and then be cooked perfectly at the same time.....remember that one was on my appetizer (burnt) and the other was on the hamburger.\\n\\nOur server was very friendly, prompt with the drink refills and attentive, all the way up until we were ready to leave......after she took our plates away, it was 5 minutes before she returned with the check.   She apologized, but by that time.....I was ready to go!\\n\\nHere's the breakdown of my rating:\\n\\nLocation: 4/5 Stars  \\nIt is right on the water at Buster Boyd Bridge.\\n\\nAtmosphere: 3/5 Stars  \\nNeeds to be updated somewhat.

        "Review: I am never going to this Lenscrafters again. The service is awful. I've been a customer for several years now and I've put up with 30 minute wait times for far too long. They need to staff this store with more associates. The latest incident occurred when I went in to order replacement lens for teenage son's glasses. Luckily they were still under warranty, so it as only $25. But, just to order the lens, my son and I waited 30 minutes. We tried to place the order, then the computers were down. So we had to move to another station. The lady was also trying to help another waiting customer at the same time. OK, lens ordered. She told me to take home the frames because they didn't need them yet. They called, I went in to pick up the lenses. The lenses hadn't been cut down to fit the glasses yet, so after yet another 30 minute wait, I found out I had to come back an hour later. Well, I work for a living and I'd already spent my entire lunch hour waiting to pick up my lenses. So I go back at 3:30 figuring it won't be that crowded. Wrong. Yet again, I waited 30 minutes. Finally, they give me my glasses with the lenses fit in and I was so aggravated I stormed out. I'm also going to write a letter to the corporate headquarters. We've been to one other lenscrafters location in PV mall and it didn't seem as bad. But regardless, Lenscrafters has now lost three customers because three people in my family wear glasses.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I was on my way back to the West Valley, from the East Valley, and did a search on my beloved Yelp for a highly rated Chinese Food joint that was on the way. China Chili kept appearing. We called in the take out order, and it was finished before I arrived. \\n\\nWe ordered the House Chicken, Spicy Garlic Eggplant, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and Fried Shrimp. And... BAM! It was bomb!\\n\\nThe House Chicken was delicious. Garlic-y, with little bit of spicyness to it, and a very subtle nuttyness to it from the oil in the wok. Great texture, great smell... It was fantastic.\\n\\nI'm not an Eggplant fan, but my gf is, and she ordered it. She said the Eggplant was a 3.5. Good, but not the best she'd ever had.   \\n\\nThe Kung Pao... Again, a very good dish. If there was a complaint, it was that it was a tad heavy on the zucchini in the dish, which was just a tad overcooked. It changed the texture in the dish in an obvious way.\\n\\nMongolian Beef. NOM NOM! Perfect. Great flavor, great texture. Very happy with the dish. \\n\\nThe Breaded Shrimp was perfect. I can only handle so much fried shrimp. Tried one, and it was spot on. \\n\\nThis was a perfect way to end a 15 hour day.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review: Jury duty has me in downtown Phoenix 2 days a week. I have never spent much time in this part of Phoenix and have made it my lunch time focus to find a good place to eat or places. I wanted a burger looked on Yelp. Coney Island Grill was close. I liked the feel of the restaurant. It is small and the tables have sewed vinyl tops to cover the tables. I liked this touch. Made the tables look very cleaned.  I went in and asked the gentleman at the cash register I was wanting a burger but did he have any recommendations. He went through several items he liked and when he recommended the Bacon Cheese Burger. About the employees. While I was waiting on the burger I had a chance to watch how they treated their customers. All I can say is WOW. Everyone got the same great service I had received. The employees were very friendly and helpful to everyone. They get an A+ for customer service. My burger came out and it was very good. It was flavorful and just the right size. I especially liked the bun. Not sure what kind of bun it was but it really made the burger. Out of all the places I have eaten down town this is one of the places I am coming back to and trying something else off their menu. If you want good food and great customer service give them a try. You will like them. Now what am I going to try next. (I will probably just ask for another recommendation). Oh Oh. The price for a burger and a drink no fries?? $7.00 plus some change. Great value!!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nOne of a must in any Korean community is the existence of a good jajangmyun and jamppong restaurants.  This is because, unlike most other Korean foods, these dishes are very difficult to replicate at home.  Many good cooks can whip up a good dwenjang jjigae, ddukbokki, or jun, and even more can fire up a kbbq or jungol on their portable gas grill that every Korean family owns.  But trying to perfect the sauces that are the catalysts for these two noodles so that they taste just like the ones from the old country, that is a monumental challenge.  For this reason, jajangmyun restaurants that make great sauces are known by every Korean in that community.  In Vegas, apparently there is Island Style.\\n\\nI guess to non-Koreans this is a Hawaiian place?  But in the Korean community, this place is known as Baek Li Hyang, a Korean-Chinese restaurant that serves up Jajangmyun, jamppong, and tang soo yook (sweet & sour pork, Korean style).  They also have other Korean dishes, one of which I noticed is the beef jun.  We were here specifically for the noodles, and thus ordered a dish of each.  Expectations were high because we heard consistently that this is the best Chinese noodle restaurant in the valley.  As a result, disappointment was also high as we realized that it was not going to meet those expectations.\\n\\nFirst the good.  Jamppong is pretty good.  The soup has that requisite taste required, and the ingredients were ample with fresh and plump seafood pieces.  The deep red color is accompanied by an equally deep taste, although not quite as spicy as it appears.  Now the mediocre.  The noodle on both dishes were just okay, not as firm and chewy as it should be indicating it's not handmade.  Take note, noodles are a big differentiator in these two dishes.  When they are not proper, it will \\\"tire out\\\" the dish.  This will result in the symptom where you will initially like it, but then find yourself not finishing the dish.  It was such here.  The bad is the jajang sauce.  It was too sweet, and did not possess that...\n\nReview rating:",

Tough to mess up fries, although they didn't have the distinct flavor they sounded like they would have. The other two dishes? I didn't know you could call the same dish under two different names.

We asked about the draft specials and they rolled their eyes and responded rudely like we were in the wrong for asking a question. I ordered an IPA, It cost me $7.75 for a Pint glass during happy hour.... anyways Upon asking for the check which took forever to get, she charged us wrong because she said she couldn't find the right button, we told her to fix it she brought back the right bill and apparently she cant count either because the Bill came out to $14.75 for 2 Pabst and an IPA, I gave her a $20 and she brought us back $3.75... These Girls were rude, no eye contact, never checked on us after she brought us our drinks just plain rude, Not sure if we got this service because we were a young guy & girl couple and not two horny dudes, they just didn't make us feel welcome. regardless we still tipped above 15%, I work in the service industry and am a Hospitality student at Unlv and it just sucks going into local bars that have employees not service oriented, that leaves places with a bad rap, and is just bad for business.\\n\\nNow the reason I gave 2 stars and not 1... Im giving the extra star to our server who was not either one of the bartenders. Ill give her and the kitchen 5 STARS. She was super sweet and prompt and checked on us unlike the bartenders. My wife got the Ahi Salad and I got the Hotiyaki Wings which both dishes came out awesome. \\n\\nI would recommend the dining part of this establishment however I would not recommend the Gaming/Bar side, and thats sad because Vegas needs a better Food and Beverage scene for locals off the strip. this place can do way better on the bar side with a friendlier staff without stuck up attitudes!

        "So this is heartbreaking.  I've been going to Havana cafe for years and over looked a lot as far as decor and service, but once the food goes... So do I.  A friend who used to live here, who was visiting, suggested Havana cafe for dinner since it was always great.  Our food was not good.  It was ok at BEST and our service was lack luster- snotty really.  Then they cleared our plates before we were done and started to vacuum while we were still eating. If we were the only people keeping them there late, which it was NOT LATE AT ALL (and we weren't the only patrons there)  I could understand, but overall the service was poor right out the gate and our food wasn't great, So we will not be going back, which breaks my heart. Since I've had many good experiences in the past. I always knew I was paying more, but I figured it was worth it, but I don't think $400 for 5 people was worth that kind of poor service.  ESPECIALLY since SO many places are closing up these days.\nSo I would like to give it",

I know that, I've gone to the airport dozens of times. (It's actually 12.2 miles).

When I ordered I wanted to get a gryo with fries the meal but the girl cut me off very quickly and didn't even try to up sale me to the meal so I had to go back in line to order my side. Also they call out number orders when they should give out table #s because its very hard to hear in there and I couldn't hear them yelling for any number over the crowd so having the table number would help people get there food faster. Lastly they did not quote me a time my food would be done for a Togo. I waited for 40 minutes to get my order not knowing when I  would get it. All in all good food poor service.

They can range from mildly uncomfortable and headache-inducing (due to the clicking, clacking, and jack-hammering sounds) to ones that have left me shaking and crying. \\n\\nSimonMed in Scottsdale has been the best experience by far. I was able to get an appointment before 7:00 AM, so I could be to work on time. The waiting room is very nicely decorated and completely spotless. The dressing rooms are super large and have a laundry basket, bench, chair, TV, and some toiletries. You actually get scrubs to wear rather than dignity robbing open gowns. It's the little touches like these that can make all the difference as to how comfortable you feel going in. And that in turn makes the time you must spend perfectly still in a tiny tube easier.\\n\\nThe staff was all friendly, but my tech was completely awesome. I wish I could remember his name. He spoke to me like an adult, gave me headphones tuned to the radio station of my choice, told me exactly what scans were coming and when I would be injected with contrast solution. He also performed the injection perfectly so that there was almost no pain, virtually no blood, and zero bruising afterward. He asked about my previous MRI experiences, and when I told him about my worst one, he said he could do the same scan in 1/2 the time. \\n\\nI know I will need to continue to get MRI's, and I sincerely hope that I will be able to keep getting them at SimonMed. They are total professionals in a state-of-the-art and comfortable environment. Highly recommended for all of your health scanning needs.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

Not some of the time, or most of the time, but every single time.  Sometimes, with the tacos, they even cover it up with extra cabbage or lettuce on top so I don't see it until I get home.  For that reason, I usually order the chicken or steak street tacos since they don't come with that gross white sauce that they put all over their seafood items.  But every once in a while I feel like a shrimp or fish taco and invariably when I get home with my takeout and taste my first bite, I realize that they put the d#!@ sauce on there.  I don't like tarter sauce or mayo or any of those creamy sauces.  I don't know why they put it on there in the first place since they have the yummy salsas for you to add to your food to your own liking.  Which leads me to another complaint that I have.  The last few times I have been to this Rubio's, they are out of the spicy carrots.  Nothing left in the container except jalepenos and liquid.  And one time I got some of the chopped onion and I could tell after one bite that it had gone bad.  A little more attention to the condiments, please!\\n\\nGet it together guys, or I will stop coming here. Even though it really convenient, if I can't eat my food when I get takeout or have to wait around while you make it twice when dining in, then why would I want to return?\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "I am a Las Vegas local and have grown up playing golf in Las Vegas during the summer. I know what to expect when golfing on a hot summer day. \\n\\nThat being said, golfing at the Revere was one of the worst experiences I have had golfing in Las Vegas, and I have played quite a few rounds. First, my foursome arrived and wanted to hit some balls at the range. However, there were no balls available at the range, so the four of us collected balls  that were 10-20 yards down the range so that we could at least get a warm up in. This was after calling the clubhouse and waiting about ten minutes for someone to bring more balls, that never even came. \\n\\nWe played the Lexington Course, and the course layout is great. Fun holes, fun tee boxes, blind shots, a unique course well-designed. \\n\\nHowever, after playing the front 9, at the turn we wanted more of the bottled water that comes with the round. However, there was no bottled water left, and the cart girl had stopped service around 2 PM (we only saw her on the second hole, never again). Keep in mind that it was 105 degrees, and there are no jugs of water anywhere on the course. We played without water the next hour and 15 minutes until there was a water fountain following the 13th hole. For a course not to provide water during the hot summer months in Las Vegas is pathetic. If you have ever played golf in Las Vegas during the summer, you know that you can easily drink an entire bottle every hole or every other hole. \\n\\nFinally, if you hit into a sand trap, you were essentially either hitting out of a concrete bed or clay, the sand was terrible. \\n\\nAll in all, my first experience at the Revere was downright awful. I will not be returning, especially with the options available in Las Vegas/Henderson.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I have typically ordered the tacos but decided to venture out today and ordered the chicken and rice with jaco sauce, a barbecue type sauce and two sides. The chicken was good, but the rice had absolutely no flavor. I ended up adding salsa from the salsa bar, and even stopped eating it. As for the sides, I ordered the Mac and cheese and corn special. The corn was great! Unfortunately the Mac and cheese was so bland and cold I took it back and got the Baked Beans, which were piping hot and so good, glad I made that switch.\\nAnd, don't bother with ordering a Bloody Mary here, straight from a bottle, no seasoning and no celery ! \\nSo, not sure if I missing something here but I am going to stick with places that have flavor and I think about getting back to.\nSo I would like to give it",

I tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult, so I tried a morning class for seniors. I like to stretch out before my class actually starts, so I went to the tail end of a yoga class. The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasn't welcome to stretch out in their class. I never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members. I didn't feel welcome here. I complained to the manager, who said that I was welcome to stretch out in whatever class I wanted to, but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident.

        "Ok, so I'm going to lay it out on the line for you. I've been to this place twice. \\n\\nI visited the first time when I was in town to see my best friend. I lived in San Francisco at the time. For starters, the place looks amazing! It is very nice and left a nice impression on me for Charlotte. The pros: The sushi is ok, but not spectacular. It lacked on presentation for such a nicely decorated place and for the prices. We are paying for the experience, right? I can get the same thing from any fast food sushi place in the city (SF). Still, the atmosphere is pretty chic, and I was enjoying time with m y best friend... then it happened. I started to notice the paintings/ pictures all over the place: of the owner... ok, so a bit vane... then it happened! She grabbed a mic and started singing karaoke in the middle of the bar, trying to get the people to clap. People were going along with it too. I was like \\\"wtf\\\" is going on! Is this a circus? Am I about to see people swinging from the ceiling? No. She sang one poorly sung song and that was it. It was completely out of place. One word: major vanity. \\n\\nVisit 2: The food was the same. We ordered sashimi and got nigiri: not a big deal, just leave the rice off.  The bill was way too high for 2 people. It was over $100 pre tip. This is way more than any sushi I have paid for in Northern California. \\n\\nSo my rating system for this one?\\nOne star b/c that's mandatory, one star for the ambience, one star because I'd probably go back simply for the atmosphere... and as long as I'm not sung to karaoke style. My rating for this place is",

        "Review: Pin Kaow used to be my favorite Thai Place in all of Vegas. But we moved away, and when we came back after 5 years we discovered that things had changed, and I'm afraid that it's not for the better. \\nTo be fair, the place looks very pretty inside since the renovations, and the waitresses now wear traditional Thai attire, which is very cool.  \\nBut the food portions are MUCH smaller, and the food quality seems to have suffered a bit, as well. (perhaps the customers are now paying for the cost of renovations?) The Thai tea tasted like regular iced tea mixed with coffee, and nutrasweet. The spring rolls were lackluster and kind of pasty inside, and the chicken soup was VERY salty, which is a complaint that I rarely ever have, seeing as how I'm a card carrying salt fiend that has actually been known to add salt to TOAST. (I shit you, not.)\\nThe Pad See Ew and Pad Prik King were both TINY. \\nNo, seriously....both were itty-bitty, teensy-weensy portions....maybe a cup worth of food per entree, at most. And honestly, the food just doesn't seem to be anywhere near as flavorful as it used it be. It was just kind of bland. \\nNeedless to say, we were extremely disappointed, because this place used to be SO good! Luckily we found Thai Grill on N. Decatur, which is even better than the old Pin Kaow (which is saying a lot, because boy did Pin Kaow ever used to be good!).\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nThe two stars as defined by Yelp as \\\"Meh. I've experienced better\\\" is a great definer.  In fact, I would amend it to say \\\"I've experienced A LOT A LOT A LOT A LOT better.\\\"\\n\\nTo establish my credibility, I must first say that I had been in the food service industry for almost 10 years (highschool and college) and so I've worked low end and high end and I think after experiencing different levels of the food industry, I know what I'm talking about.  Additionally, as a food service worker, I would have appreciated a guest like me letting the restaurant know if there was something amiss.  However, there was so much wrong with last nights dinner that I could have had an hour long talk with the manager about the millions of things that needed to be done to fix the quality of the restaurant and in particular, Manuel's service.\\n\\nSo, I'm sure you're wanting to hear about the restaurant.  I came in with a larger group around 8:15.  I called ahead to let them know we were coming.  We had a range of people that I thought were coming - between 10 and 13.  They were busy and part of their restaurant (the bar portion) was closed due to renovations, so this already busy restaurant had limited capacity.  No problem.  My group was relaxed and flexible.  We had nowhere to be and the bartender made us a couple of drinks while we waited.  (He was probably the best part of the night.)\\n\\nAs we waited in the front room, a hostess in a very rude voice asked if we had any idea of the real total of our party yet.  She claimed that it would change our waiting time (which was of little importance to us) and said, \\\"you only have 7 people here right now, how many more are going to show up?\\\"  I calmly told her at least 10 and we'll squeeze together if we need to add more, no problem.  I don't know if she was having a rough night, but it was just her attitude, tone, and the fact that she did not approach us to have the conversation but rather stood by and hung on the seating podium that really irritated me.\\n\\nOnce we were seated...\n\nStars:",

So I sat on a book aisle. About 20 mins later, a staff came by and told me I couldn't sit on the aisle. I told her the reason I sat on the floor was because there was no seating. Would I really want to sit on the floor unless I had to???? I didn't catch the lady's name, but she was an older lady. Must be having a bad day or something. But I ALWAYS sit on the floor when there are no seating and no one has ever told me to move. She walked over to the cafe and try to direct me over and pointed to a couple open tables.

        "Review text:\nWhen you think of Las Vegas, you think of bigger and over-the-top, but prepare yourself for disappointment upon entering the Hooters Restaurant in the Hooters Casino.  To put it best: it's an ordinary Hooters restaurant that happens to be in Vegas, as opposed to being the \\\"Vegas Hooters.\\\"  Expect your typical Hooters experience but in a drearier setting because the Hooters Casino is a bit dingy, and with so many other places to visit for cheap greasy food this place is usually very quiet.\\n\\nIn my opinion, Hooters should consider putting more money into the location and making it a Vegas destination.  There are other places with better looking waitresses and cheap food/drinks, so why limit one's self to this hole in the wall location?  In Vegas, there are too many options for attractive waitresses to be stuck at this place - that's the feeling that I got during my visits.  There is nothing wrong with the place and it is your typical Hooters experience, but shouldn't the expectations be higher in Vegas?  \\n\\nI have been to several Hooters restaurants throughout California, and have been to the Vegas location 3-4 times.  I actually stayed at the hotel on one occasion during a last minute Vegas trip when my usual places were booked, so I have a thorough perspective of the hotel, bar, casino, and restaurant.  The Vegas Hooters isn't bad but it really can't compete with the other Vegas options.  The casino and bar area is sad and depressing, but the rooms are super cheap and better than the local roach motels.  \\n\\nI'm a guy that likes wings, beers, and stealing glances at the waitresses, but in Vegas, there are so many nicer places for the same cost, that I can't really recommend the restaurant unless you've never been to a Hooters restaurant before.  It's not bad, but there is no energy and the vibe is nonexistent.  This location is average when compared to other Hooters locations, but less than average when compared to other options in the area.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nThe quality of My Wine Cellar seems to have decreased over the past few years since it reached its peak around late 2005.  First, their hours diminished dramatically, so much that, if you aren't there for a happy hour or an early dinner, you're out of luck.  Closing at 9 PM on a Saturday just enticed me to skip over the place entirely and make an evening out of it somewhere else.  Then, although admittedly, their first priority is wine, they took Shiner Bock off of the tap selections.  Finally, their quality of food went from 'notable' to 'forgettable', so much so, that I stopped ordering their specialties and went strictly with pizza.  While their pizza is quite tasty, there is a cap on the amount of pizza-and-wine dinners one can have weekly, which was about the amount of time I put in there over the past few years.  That being said, you should support this place based on their discriminant selections of wine.  While its not a bad place to grab a glass of wine, you'd better get there early.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Part of the reason I wanted to get a tattoo in the first place is that I am such a planner to a fault that I wanted to put myself through an experience that I wouldn't be able to completely control every aspect of. That being said, once I had made the decision, I researched my potential tattoo shop and artist very carefully. After all, I only wanted to lose a bit of control once I actually knew I was in the capable hands of a professional! \\n\\nI started here on Yelp, noticing right away that there weren't that many tattoo shops even reviewed. Urban Art stood out to me, not only because it had a high star rating, but because everyone who had actually gotten a tattoo there (as opposed to a piercing) gave it five stars. That didn't seem to be true of the other places I read about. To be fair, No Regrets Tattoo had a pretty high star rating, but I don't know, the name freaked me out a bit! (I'm sure that's not the effect they wanted to have!). \\n\\nAnyway, my decision to go to Urban Art for my first tattoo was cemented when I was at Habit Salon in Mesa getting my hair done (great experience, review to come!) and noticed that the stylist next to my station had a gorgeous sleeve tattoo with lots of great color and beautiful flowers. I asked her where she had gone and she said that she had gone to Justin at Urban Art. You can't beat being able to see someone's amazing work in person, so I was totally sold!\\n\\nI called a few days later to make an appointment and was blown away by how nice and professional the person I spoke with was. (After going there, I learned that her name was Samantha.) From my past piercing experiences, I guess I just expected some attitude. I told her that I wanted to make an appointment with Justin and asked what the next steps were. She told me that I needed to come in for a consultation, but once I told her that I lived pretty far (on the Phoenix/Laveen border), she said it was OK if I emailed Justin directly to give him the details and schedule a time. I'm sure it's standard practice to go...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I'm so sorry, Pho Saigon 8, but I'm no longer one of your fans.  My family and I have been regular patrons here whenever we need our \\\"pho phix,\\\" but it just doesn't seem the same anymore.  Sadly, the quality of your food has gone away.  I don't know if you are cutting costs with a sub-par ingredients list now, but your food doesn't quite taste the same anymore.  Add to that that some of your menu items have gone up in price which seems more difficult to swallow.\\n\\nTwice in the past 2 weeks we've dined here, and twice we've gone home feeling some kind of indigestion - both of us, and both our kids.  It's weird to explain this, but we have to attribute it to what we had eaten there.  It is all too coincidental.\\n\\nAny pho you select here is delicious, but something just isn't right anymore.  It has got to be the freshness or quality of the ingredients.  I had even tried their Bun Rieu, vermicelli noodle and crab soup, for the first time and left here feeling less than satisfied.  The crab meat just didn't taste fresh.\\n\\nLastly, according to the server, they've changed the way that they make their Da Chanh and Soda Chanh, fresh lemon drink and fresh lemon soda.  It tasted different this time around; even my son thought so, and you know kids' palates...you change a simple ingredient and they can taste the difference immediately.  They either put some weird syrup in it now or they use different lemons or limes...hard to say, but it had a strange, almost close to a lychee-flavored taste, to it.  Unfortunately, they forgot the key ingredient - \\\"freshness.\\\"  They should have stuck to their original way of making it.  It was very thirst-quenching then.\\n\\nBittersweet Adieu...\nSo I would like to give it",

I have no problem paying for a good meal, but this wasn't a good meal. I could have made what ended up on my plate from the contents of my refrigerator and it would have tasted better. \\n\\nThe one caveat to my \\\"My Florist has crappy food\\\" attitude is the cinnamon scones. These are absolute heaven. Too bad I won't be back for them, as getting one means dealing with the rude staff. \\n\\nOut of the five visits, only once was the service decent, and I think it was only because my dining companion knew the server. That's bad. I never went in dressed like a bum or treated the staff obnoxiously, but yet the staff had no problem treating me like a second class citizen who didn't belong in the restaurant. I don't know what kind of qualifications you have to have to get decent service here, but I obviously don't have them. \\n\\nI won't be back ever.

The only reason for the 4 star was that I wandered around the store finding things on my own without any greeting for about 10 min.   Once someone did decide I needed help though, I got everything that I needed.  They helped explain to me that bad behaviors (marking in the house) is probably caused by a number of issues that we as pet owners need to address (lack of attention, lack of reprimanding, lack of separation of pets when no one is home, ect).  Not only did I get all the products I needed for properly kenneling my pup, but I also got helpful tips on getting the cat to act more appropriate and I was shown different sprays that you can use throughout the home to keep both dogs and cats from being naughty.  \\n\\nAlso, a rather large dog started barking at my 7lb little one and the staff instantly swooped in to grab all the products from my hands so I could pick my pup up into safety (even though both dogs were on leashes).\n\nReview rating:",

He called yesterday and asked if he had to print it out or of he could just bring in his phone. They told him he could show it on his phone, and then my husband informed them he'd be in the next day to redeem it. They said okay. So fast forward to today (1/24). My husband shows the guy the coupon when he went to pay, and the guy said he wouldn't accept it because they were already running a $10 off deal. Obviously we knew we weren't going to get $14 off the already discounted price, so we just asked him to price it at regular price then give us the $14 off since our coupon was worth more. He didn't budge. We had another coupon for 15% of the other services they did but they still wouldn't take it. So I'm angry for two reasons: 1) our coupons were completely invalid when they shouldn't have been and 2) nobody told my husband that he couldn't use it when he called about it yesterday. Although it was only 4 dollars, it's really the principle. We didn't even get an apology for this inconvenience. Pretty poor customer service on their behalf. These guys have officially lost two regular customers over this. I hope the 4 bucks was worth it, Jiffy Lube!\n\nReview rating:",

As long as you don't mind the sparse and tacky feel of being in a place that looks like it used to be a dime store in it's prior life then The Great Wall could just be the place.\\n\\nHey, ambience costs more.  The buffet is $9.95; drinks (soda, milk, tea) is extra.  The waitresses are very attentive and refill drinks without being asked at no additional charge.\\n\\nCome when they first open.

They throw in a little Japanese tempura and a little Thai just for good measure.  All the dishes are marked clearly and indicate whether it's hot or spicy.  Personally, I am partial to the baby octopuss, crab puffs and baos.  For the kiddies there is some \\\"American\\\" fare like salad, jello and egads, chicken nuggets.\\n\\nIt's kinda funny really, but if you are not picky, what the heck.\\n\\nThis is not gourmet by any means, but they won't try to chase you out and they are kid friendly.\\n\\nIf buffet is not your \\\"thing\\\" they do have a regular menu, but why bother?\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The restaurant is on the corner of 16th St. and Bethany Home in a rundown strip mall. The spots themselves are short and it's difficult to get into and out of the lot. Not sure if there is a special trick to parking here but please keep in mind when you come that parking is sucky. \\n\\nNow, bear in mind when you come here, there are not many \\\"healthy options\\\" on the menu. And they are not ashamed of this at all. They embrace the Texas size deep fried, heavily battered foods they offer unabashedly.

I wish I knew what Guy recommended so I could decided what to try from the massive selection! I am not a burger person, but the hot pot roast and fries with gravy sounded pretty good to me! When I saw the gigantic plate coming from the kitchen I knew right away I couldn't finish it. For the price, the portion size alone is a value!\\n\\nI did also order Wedding soup. Something I never even heard of before moving to Pittsburgh, The soup itself was very delicious. Not bland and with few meatballs (which is FINE with me!). At least I didn't have to ask for the Parmesan cheese, the server brought it out with the soup.\\n\\nMy meal itself was just okay. The bread was kind of tough and hard to cut. The beef didn't have much flavor, but the gravy helped this. The fries, sadly, tasted like the oil they were cooked in needed changed badly. At first I though maybe it was just that there was still skin left on the potatoes, but Darren pointed out the oil problem.\\n\\nAnother comment, WHAT IS WITH THIS AREA AND CURT SERVERS??? If you aren't from Pittsburgh I think you'll be shocked at the rudeness. Darren seems used to it (swearing that \\\"they aren't being rude\\\")...and if this is what you get used to here, I am heartbroken.

The man that is there all the time, who is also the owner, ruined a silk skirt of mine and tried to blame it on anything and everything but him.  It was the worst customer service I have experienced in my life and that is no exaggeration.  He has extremely poor business skills and morals.  After a very long drawn out process  I received no apology, not even once.  He did give me the money to replace the skirt after me arguing with him on numerous occasions over a span of a few weeks and having to bring my husband with me.  When I also told him I wanted my skirt back to take it somewhere else, he lied to me and told me my skirt was not there any longer.  Luckily my husband saw the skirt laying on a table in the back and pointed it out to him.  We had to argue with him further because he said it was someone else's skirt.  This skirt is very unique looking and we knew it was mine.  After a few minutes he gave it to us in a rude huff and told us to \\\"just go!\\\".

        "Review: I've been here about 4 times; the hygienists have always been nice and friendly, and they do a good job.  The latest one was particularly helpful and provided useful advice.  However, when the dentist actually came to examine me, his bedside manner was not very friendly; he appeared rushed and was a bit rough during his examination.  He seems young, and that's not a bad thing, but that may be a factor in his inexperience.  He also spoke to his assistant about me and my dental needs as if I weren't sitting right there in the exam chair.  Felt awkward and uncomfortable.  \\nAfter the exam, I was then escorted to the special room where they provide the pricing for the dental procedures I need.  The pricing specialist was friendly and nice--that is, until I said I couldn't make an appointment for the $500 procedure I needed.  I just don't have the money right now, and I tried explaining that, but the mood sure changed when the pricing specialist realized I couldn't do it.  Yikes.  I realize that they're running a business, but this isn't the first time that I felt as if they were more concerned with getting my money than actually helping with my dental needs.  \\nUnfortunately, I will probably return to Southwest Dental because it's close to where I live and appointments are relatively easy to acquire, but I won't go there happily, unfortunately.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Simply the best. In all, Dr. McCaffrey is just a really good guy. \\n\\nMy wife and I have been a patient of Dr. McCaffrey for almost three years and couldn't ask for a better dentist. The dentist can often be a difficult place to visit. However, my visits to Red Rock Dental have consistently been enjoyable. \\n\\nDr. McCaffrey is always very generous with his time - explaining exactly what is happening and ultimately, gives his patients options. He speaks to his patients on a level playing field and in all is just a really good guy. \\n\\nIn terms of pain management, Dr. McCaffrey is truly gifted, he has a way of sensing when you are uncomfortable and I can truly say: I've never been in pain during any visit; which is truly remarkable in itself. \\n\\nMs. Gene (the office hygienist)  may also be the most experienced in the city. She's amazing. \\n\\nFrom top to bottom Red Rock Dental is everything you'd look for in a dentist.\nSo I would like to give it",

So when I get bad service, a generally OK experience becomes anything but OK. Lets buy a ticket and check out Alice Cooper'stown.\\n\\n~Fud/Drink~\\nGeneral....bar....fare. That makes it really simple for everyone. Now they have some interesting food options, yes, but there is nothing special. Why elaborate further? Alice's joint only offers greasy fried food options, with little time put into the preparing of said items.  For a football event I went to, they were offering breakfast. I ordered a cheese/egg quesadilla which was \\\"edible\\\". Filled with grease, I had second thoughts after ordering it, but was hungry. Meh. Of the two stand out items on their menu, the 22 inch hotdog named \\\"The Big Unit\\\" is a big hit. Its big, yes....but that's where it ends. You pay $17+ for a big hotdog guys...its really nothing much to write home about. Why pay that?? If going to the Dbacks game, why not get one or two $1 dogs at Chase? Just saying... I must say the other item on the menu that stood out was the catcher's mitt brownie. For $4.99 you get a HUGE warm brownie plus a scoop of ice cream, everyone at the table was impressed. \\n\\nAs for drinks, they really are just overpriced. I know they have rent, I get it. But seriously, $6.50 for a draft that isn't close to a pint? Horrible pricing decision. I would've had an extra beer but this turned me off immediately. Nothing else to say, just too expensive for what you are getting!\\n\\n~Atmosphere/Service~\\nAtmosphere is OK, it could be so much better. The inside is fun on the surface, and they have some cool memorabilia hanging up..it is nice to see what Alice put out for us to view. But overall the bar is there for large groups to gather and talk, no extra fluff. When each Big Unit comes out, an obnoxiously loud ringing bell sounds and the bar staff yells out a chant. After a good 30+ rings, I was saved by the bell when my football game ended. As for...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

My wife and I went here due to indecisiveness and lazy to drive else where. \\n\\nMoreover the staff is quite friendly and pretty quick at serving the beverages. However the food...how can I say this...the food was sooo bland no taste. And for some reason right when I get my food and then sit down the food is already cold. Luckily we got there at dinner where they gave us more options. For example crabs legs, but even though the taste of the crab legs something was off. The butter for the crab legs taste like if it was old butter just being reused. \\n\\nI hate to give them such of a low rating but the fact that i couldn't eat another plate because of the taste and that my wife and I felt sick mildly sick afterwards.

I noticed that in Pod D the DAY nurses are a little less attentive and slower to respond to the remote control caller button than the night Pod D nurses were.  \\n\\nPod C nurses were nicer than Pod D nurses overall, and many of them are friends with each other and attend the same church and even quietly sung some of their church songs together on the night shift, which was very comforting in my opinion.

        "Review text:\nLocated on the corner in a small strip mall off Warm Springs, this is more of a locals place. A really dark bar with a Pub feel- the ceiling is neat, architectural detail (if you've got those dark prescription glasses, watch your step); outside there is a fireplace, which is neat for cold nights. It's smoky, so your clothes might wreak of the smell, just a warning (I don't smoke, so it's not at all appealing to me). Some booths are located on the left upon entering. I can't tell you too much of the rest of the place because we pretty much stayed at the booth the whole time.  \\n\\nThe bartender seated us at lunch time; she was nice, took our drink and food order, and returned to her station (the bar). The menu was pretty big, for being a bar, and the prices were pretty reasonable (average price being around $7.00). I think the cook delivered the food to us, because I saw him in the kitchen, from where we were seated. \\n\\nMy father-in-law said that the chicken fingers (there are different flavors, like regular, spicy, and teriyaki) and waffle cut fries were really delicious, but I didn't feel like having a full order of either, so I got the nachos (my husband didn't like it- said it was plain, no beans and no meat). But my appetite hasn't been the same since my operation last month (ok, a funny story, so my husband's friends came to visit last month, and her mom said \\\"I don't know where she puts it\\\"- it's funny, but yes, I like to eat!), so I was fine with it. It was a big platter, came with two plates, chips topped with cheese (could've used more cheese, though), jalapenos (love the heat), salsa, olives, and one generous scoop each of sour cream and guacamole (love guacamole). I'm sort of a nachos buff when it comes to the weekends or vacation, so this was alright, by my standards. My husband let me sample a chicken finger and some fries. The chicken fingers are mostly meat, not composed mostly of yucky batter which seems to be the norm at most places; very good!

        "Review text:\nUpon first moving to Charlotte we were put in temporary housing at Cheswyck at Ballantyne. Although only there for about a month, I have to say that it was a great experience. Most of the people who lived there were there permanently, from what I could tell, and it was a nice little gated community. They have 2 pools, 2 gyms, and a business center with 4 computers. They also provide bike rentals for those of you into cycling. There were always plenty of chairs at the pools, and there was also a tennis court and two areas for grilling. Each unit has a balcony, washer/dryer and dishwasher, which was very convenient. \\n\\nWe got to our 1 bedroom apartment late on a Saturday night and found everything totally in order, very clean and put together. Since it was a temporary set up our place was fully furnished, and even our kitchen table was set with wine glasses and 2 place settings. We couldn't have asked for more. They do require a one time non-refundable pet fee, and we found out after asking that this was so that each unit could be cleaned once you and your pet(s) leave. Our unit was spotless, and our cat would have definitely smelled the scent of another animal and he did not. He told me so. LOL, kidding of course - you pet owners can attest that you know when your animal could sense another (just go pet the neighbors dog for a few and then come back home to your pet).\\n\\nI have two gripes about Cheswyck: the first being that the gates are sometimes open, leaving access for anyone who wants to come in, and the second more minor gripe being the business center - they don't put paper in the printer. EVER. Because it got too expensive, I was told. I can't tell you how many times I drove or walked over there, only to remember I had no paper. ARG. Otherwise, great place to live.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Whenever I find myself hungry at 2am (which happens more often than I'd care to admit), my first inclination is to head here.  If you can hit it before the after-bar crowd gets there, it's a much better scene. Anything minus loud drunk people being obnoxious is a plus in my opinion.\\n\\nThe 50s style is fun and fabulous in its own way (jukeboxes - sweet!), the staff and clientele are decidedly queer (which is good because so am I) and there's no lack of personality.  There seems to be one ornery waitress who has no problem telling folks where they can go, but perhaps that's her being \\\"in character\\\" ... or something.  Happily our favorite server \\\"Spinner\\\" usually scoops us up when we come in and takes very good care of us. Drinks never go empty and my dining companion's cherry Mr. Pibb always gets extra cherry just the way he likes it (and Spinner's been known to bring 2 because he finishes them quickly) and new black tea gets brewed when I walk in.  It really is the little things and being remembered that make the difference between good and great.\\n\\nThe food is hearty and portions are decent, though it's a tad bit pricey, but at 2am it's worth it to not have to do it myself.  Their meatloaf sandwich is awesome (minus the garlic mushrooms for me, but I don't eat mushrooms) and the Hot Pastrami and Reuben are equally tasty. Even the turkey dinner hit the spot one night (despite the mushrooms in the stuffing - and for me that's saying something). My late-night dining companion (who was born in the wrong era and should have been a \\\"greaser\\\") raves about the eggs bennedict.  He has tried several different variations on this including the chipotle style and liked them all. He is also huge on the shakes - the orange creamsicle is his favorite. We have literally come here just for a shake - they're that good. They even have a PB&J shake. Not sure that's for me, but it sure is interesting that it's an option. Thick and delicious and served with the metal cup on the side with the extras - 2 straws upon request,... My rating for this place is",

With your order they give you these crispy fried homemade chips. Also, try their banana nut bread, so delicious.\\n\\nI will definitely be coming back. I want some more Lox benedict, :-)\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nI only gave this place 2 stars because of the environment that it is in.  A \\\"hard to find place\\\" is an understatement if it's dark outside and you have never been here.   I have to agree, the crust of the pizza is amazingly flakey and delicious.  I'm a crusty guy, so I like good crust and though it's up there with a soft boboli it's still easy to eat and won't rough up your mouth.  I ordered the Ephesus Pizza with lamb skewers ($16.00 large).  It is a white pizza with minimal ingredients except for the lamb skewers.  They packed on 8-9 small skewers of lamb and I have to admit, the lamb was very tasty and tender.  The problem I have with this place is the filthy, trash laden environment it sits in.  It's on the mezzanine level (2nd floor) of a some financial building and when I got there, the exterior doors to the building were locked and luckily a group of people showed up and punched in the code to get one of the side doors opened...it was strange.  However, when you walk in that side door, I was faced with the stairwell with trash cans spewed about.  when I entered the pizza/sandwich joint, it was in disarray, bread was in crates on the floor and trash cans were overflowing.  The bathroom was in a construction zone and filthy.  All of this added up to being afraid to eat anything because you were unsure as to how fresh the food was and how well kept the kitchen may or may not have been.  I'm not a fluffy guy, but I need some fluff in my establishments...look clean, feel clean, feel safe and I can live with whatever you dish out, but when first impressions are nasty and dirty, it hits homeplate way before the food hits my mouth.   I still like the pizza and I will only send my pot smoking, beer drinking partying friends to this place, because I would be afraid of what others may think of it and consequently, think of me and my tastes.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nThis is my favorite place to come for fish fry (fish and chips to anyone outside of the Midwest).  There's not one thing I dislike about this dish here.  Perfectly battered cod with a crispy outside and moist flaky center, perfectly cooked and seasoned fries, and a great tarter sauce (so often overlooked).  It is all you can eat which includes both the fries and the cod.  There's no reason you should leave this place hungry.   One plate is usually enough anyways. \\n\\nIf you like the Friday fish fry but want to avoid the crowd I would suggest visiting Quivey's on a Wednesday.  They offer the same all you can eat special for both lunch and dinner but without the hour and a half wait.  \\n\\nSo about the service.  The last few times I've been here the service has been great.   Unfortunately this hasn't always been the case, and I've known others that have had a similar experience.  I hope things have turned around.  I really enjoy dinning here and for a time the food was the only thing I found exceptional.\n\nStars:",

        "AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS UNLESS YOU LIKE BEING DISRESPECTED AND TREATED LIKE COMPLETE GARBAGE BY THE G.M.\\n\\nMy rating for this store is a -20 stars!\\n\\nI have been a customer of Cobblestone for 7 years now and I typically go to the one on the 51 & Bell. Needless to say that is the only location I will be going to after my awful experience at the FLW store. I am a fast-pass member and happened to be in the area of FLW & Hayden so I stopped by to get my car wash ( it was convenient at the time) The exterior wash  I signed up for includes air freshener squares. I had my window rolled down to ask about getting a specific scent. The man at the front of the wash completely ignored me and actually ended up spraying me with the hose they use to get the junk of the hood of your car. Needless to say I was completely unhappy. As i went through the wash I parked my car in order to let the guy dry it and went up to somebody asking about why i did not receive what I paid for. The guy I spoke to about this is supposedly the General Manager of that store named Shawn, and never in my life have I been treated with such blatant disrespect. He raised his voice and started arguing with me in front of his employees as well as other customers ( I was so embarrassed) that the wash I had did not come with the air freshener squares. I explained to him that when I signed up I was informed that my wash included the squares and every single time I get my car washed at Greenway or Bell I have always received exactly what I paid for. Shawn kept arguing with me basically calling me a liar and told me that the other locations only did it because I requested them or they were just being nice which I stated that they \\\"were doing their job correctly.\\\" I also informed him that I have been to this location (being FLW) and received them there too. Shawn continued to argue with me over and over about something as simple as an air freshener which I find absolutely ridiculous. Never have I had somebody treat me so poorly let alone a...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I was out on errands & getting hungry, so I stopped into this place today for lunch.  I see these \\\"Long Wong's\\\" places all over town, but this is the first time I've tried one of them.  Here's how it was at this one:\\n\\nFirst off, it's a real dump, ala Taco Bite.  Part of the menu is up on a board behind the counter, & the rest is strewn around all over the walls & on erasable boards.\\n\\nI ordered a \\\"Special\\\" from the listless counter girl, which was promoted as 6 hot chicken wings & a cheeseburger for $4.95.  You have to pay BEFORE they fix the food, & before you can beg to go to the bathroom to wash your hands.  (It lives behind a locked hallway door that has a big sign on it saying that you can't use the bathroom!)\\n\\nThey wouldn't trust me with the hallway-to-the-bathroom door key, but instead I had to wait for girl to go let me in!  Once inside the bathroom, it's a good thing I didn't have to go, because not only doesn't the door lock, it doesn't even CLOSE!  You pull it closed & it opens back up a foot or two, I guess so that the staff can keep an eye on you in there!\\n\\nBack out in the dining room, I took a seat in a booth.  Next to it was a window with big, heavy bars on it like a jail!  I brought a book to read, but I couldn't hear myself think, because the TV on the wall was blabbing out, so I sat.  It was cold in there, too.  It's no wonder they make you pay first!  Otherwise I would have left.\\n\\nSo then in a little while girl brought out my food.  The cheeseburger bun was REFRIGERATOR COLD, & the \\\"6 wings\\\" were actually THREE, because they count each side of the wing as a wing.  Also, they were the tiniest chicken wing pieces I have ever seen, not more than 2 inches long each.\\n\\nAfter eating this dinky meal my fingers were all gooey, but I didn't feel like going through the hassle of trying to get girl to let me into the bathroom again to wash my hands, so I drove home with them like that.  When I got home, I washed my hands & fixed myself something to eat.\\n\\nEek!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Literally the bacon, sausage, and most everything else was cold on morning 1... like leftovers kinda cold. And the hash browns were to die for, literally.\\n\\nDay 2 I got smart and ordered a fresh made omelette. Redemption is like a tall glass of ice water.\\n\\n3. The fire alarm.

I had some isses with my car, expected for a used car. The service dept was awful. They couldn't replicate a very apparent issue with the car so I had to go hold their hand and replicate the issue (whole front end creeking when driving over speed bumps, gutters, etc) It ended up need new bushings and sway arms. The minute I got the service guy in my car and I crept over the first gutter and speed bump, the car made the sound. Took 3 seperate services for them to fix this issue, the last time they had my car over 2 weeks. I do love my car now, but would never send someone to Findlay VW to purchase or get service. They even offered a free tank of gas for my troubles. With gas at $4 a gallon, I haven't even gone back for that. My rating for this place is",

Everything tasted like it was frozen and the reheating instructions are to microwave pretty much everything. I realized getting a take-out dinner isn't going to be the freshest, but I've ordered from Whole Foods and Von's in the past and wasn't dissapointed. This meal however was terrible and very salty. It tasted like a Thanksgiving frozen dinner and I followed all the instructions carefully. We knew something was strange when we arrived and all the meals were being unloaded from big trucks in the parking lot. Won't be doing it again.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Next to that, beer is pretty damage cheap which is a win. Food is good too, go on a Tuesday if you can get a spot and you can make your own hamburger for practically nothing. My college favorite was a hamburger pattie, chicken filet, onions, tomato, lettuce, french fries, jalepanoes, pepperjack cheese, and buffalo sauce with a side of fried patios. This thing was so big it could barely fit in my mouth. I think with all of those extra ingredients the total cost with a Yuengling was $9 on Tuesday. The place fills up so you have to go early on Tuesday. But overall they have great happy hour specials during the entire week that are must to go to.\n\nReview rating:",

Since his joining of the resident modern dance company at the Herberger, I've seen him perform twice now at this theater. \\n\\nI love that they have multiple theaters in one building. Because of this, the Herberger is always buzzing with people. There are people of all ages here, except for maybe the ushers. I'm not sure who's responsible for the lighting, and sound here, but I think they do a really tremendous job. I'm not at all the type who is into details, but I mentioned this to my brother, and he said he was also really impressed, even from stage. \\n\\nI'd really like to find another excuse to see a show here, and it seems like they bring a great selection. The theater center is newly remodeled, and there's a cute little lounge upstairs called Bob's Spot. Also upstairs is a small art gallery. I've seen a few great sculptures of there, and even a Leslie Nielson plaque....random. \\n\\nWe usually find pretty decent street parking given that it is downtown.

I also should be able to tell you the names of the weekend bartenders who served the better half and I ever so well during out last visit and most importantly I should be able to tell you how great of a place this is to casually drink your sorrows away/into fruition.

On a recent night the better half and I vowed to step outside of our comfort zone and meet some work friends for drinks at an hour where we normally wouldn't expect most bars to be packed to capacity.

        "Review text:\nI came here for lunch yesterday with my mama. This place is tiny but it definitely has character. There were 2 people sitting outside & 3 people inside, so they weren't exactly busy. We sat close to the bar & listened to a couple guys playing guitars & a woman sang a couple songs. My mom put $5 in their tip jar & one of the guys came over to give us a flyer & chat, he was so sweet. For our meals: mama ordered the panini italiano & I ordered the pesto chicken sandwich, for sides she chose the house salad & I chose the potato salad. Mom enjoyed her meal, as did I, but I had to salt the potato salad & even that didn't help-it was pretty blah. I took half of mine & half of my mama's sandwich home for hubby, he liked both but said mom's was better. Total for both meals including drinks was $22. One thing that was a lil annoying was how slow the service was. Our server was very nice but it took 30 minutes just to get our food, which seemed way too long for a place that only had 7 customers total. It was pretty good food though, so I'd probably return.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nTotally incredible way to spend an afternoon with my family - these museums have it all! Since we have a family membership (which I highly recommend), we typically pop in for an hour or two at a time, focusing on different areas of the complex in Oakland every time we go. Our daughter seems to enjoy the dinosaurs the most, but she's also intrigued by the art collection! My favorite part is the Hall of Architecture, filled with many incredible casts of facades and sculptures. Just the fact that they have casts of the Venus de Milo and Nike of Samothrace is unbelieveable - I don't think that casting of these timeless works of art is even allowed anymore. Don't miss out on the basement kid's room, because it's full of hands-on activities for the young ones.\\n\\nWe will definitely keep our membership current as the years go on - it's timeless, and always fun!\n\nReview rating:",

        "My wife and I stayed here for a week last year, and we welcomed the opportunity to come back.  The room is basically a large studio with a large bath.  There are louvered French doors in between the bedroom and the living room, and I just have to be very quiet when I waken since I usually wake up earlier than my wife.  But we love the comfortable set up.  The shower stall is huge and there is a large Jacuzzi tub which neither of us have yet to use (we do have one at home, after all,) and double sinks and lots of cabinet space in the bathroom.  We always get a king bed, and there is not much storage in the bedroom but plenty in the bathroom.  Full refrigerator, no dishwasher or washer/dryer, but we knew that, and there is a toaster and coffreemaker and mcrowave.   DVD player, Videotape player and flat screen TV in the living room, and many recent DVD movies for free at the front desk.  There is an additional smaller flat screen TV on the bedroom wall.  Only tihng a litte different here is the parking--you may not park close to your unit, but the front desk is always happy to give you a ride on golf carts whenever you ask.  The friendly bellmen take your luggage in for you as you unpack and pack your car.  This is a full golf resort, so all of the units look out over the golf course with beautiful picture windows.  There is a huge pool and sun deck and spa, very nice and comfortable for many people.  Only other negative is their effort to sell you a time share--we're getting a little fed up with that when we get trades or getaways via Interval International, and we do not like being harrassed to do that when we make it clear at check in that we are not interested.  In spite of that, we will probably be back a third time, or every year as long as it is available.  We love Scottsdale and this is the second year in a row we have driven 2000 miles one-way to enjoy two weeks in the beautiful desert!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I went here with my family on a Friday night.  There were six adults and two kids.  We went early, about 6:30 - 7 to avoid the rush.  We parked in the garage in the same block.  The fee is validated by the restaurant.  I was very excited to try this place because my family has eaten here before and said they love it. The first thing I noticed was the floor, is was so slippy from grease that I almost fell even wearing flat shoes.  The second thing I noticed was that our waitress was just not having it that night.  She apparently didn't feel like smiling, talking, or having any patience that night.  She was so unfriendly that my uncle actually thanked her for taking the time to take our order to try to lighten her mood.  At least that made her smile. As we waited for our food I noticed two more things...the decors is pretty cool; a lot of signed and framed broadway show posters and antique bicycles, and the corn bread is amazing.  I ordered their famous salmon cakes since 1. they are famous 2. I love crab cakes 3. I love salmon. Unfortunately I did not care for them.  The flavor was really fishy and the texture was pasty.  Having cats as pets, this entree really reminded me of their canned food.  My sides were the collard green and macaroni and cheese.  This was the cheesiest and most comforting comfort macaroni I have ever had.  My husband ordered the special of the night which was pork chops stuffed with apple corn bread.  He loved it.  I sampled some of the kids' chicken tenders which were hands down the best chicken tenders I've ever had.  I even enjoyed them cold the next day.  I was not surprised that the floor was like an oil slick being that many menu items were fried.  During our dining experience the servers sang a birthday song to a customer at another table.  It was the best birthday song I've ever heard at a restaurant.  The servers were enjoying themselves singing too.  Overall my family was satisfied with their meals.  The quantity is large and the prices are low.  I took a piece of sweet potato... My rating for this place is",

This is the first great pizza I have had in Charlotte.  The crust is thin - the kind of crust you can fold in half to eat.  We ordered one large pizza - half cheese, half pepperoni and mushroom.  Very, very good.  We also ordered a medium Fiorentina pizza - no red suace, simply cheese, garlic, and spinach.  Wow was that pizza amazing!  My kids devoured it.

The food, burgers in both instances, has been consistently good.  Now I live really really close to the infamous Kuma's Corner in Chicago--their burgers are so famous they've been featured on the Food Network.

Who apologized profusely in order to pry that check out of my hands, rather than have me take it to another dealership and pick out another vehicle (thus giving him back the Traverse with what was then 1000 miles on it, and slapping him with a lawsuit over the Tahoe he sold out from under me and never bothered to pay for).\\n\\nI explained to Mike that they owed me, my credit was now dinged due to THEIR lack of payment, and as a gesture of good faith the LEAST they could do, would be to guarantee me free oil changes and basic vehicle maintenance (tire rotation, etc...) for as long as I owned the Traverse.

We were already pretty drunk at this point and the limo driver was kind enough to let us bring our champagne bottle with straws in it into the limo.  The woman taking our money when we got to the club was not so kind.  Cue four girls chugging champagne in a ghetto parking lot in Vegas.  I think we paid $20 to get in but then were told we also had a two drink minimum we had to meet.  I think I ordered a $12 screwdriver which was watered down and weak.  Two sips in I was determined to not get another drink there so I nursed that one for the next couple hours.  \\n\\nThe vibe here was weird.  We started out on the first level with the ladies and almost all the men that were there were sitting far away from the stage and not tipping.  Rude.  We sat in the tipping aisle and got a very kind reception from the girls.  The girls were cute but not super hot, but they made up for it in talent.  Most of my tipping money went to them because I was just so impressed with the acrobatics.  They showed us a great time.  \\n\\nEventually we ventured upstairs the the male stripper section.  It was a bachelorette party after all.  I was instantly uncomfortable.  Only one of the six or so guys was even remotely attractive but that quickly doesn't matter when you see the corny costumes and witness the floor humping.  We all got roped into getting lap dances and honestly, I would have rather had a dance from one of the girls downstairs.  We decided that this was a total mess so we just decided to go with it.  We were pretty much openly making fun of them and at one point my sister started giving my friends dances because honestly, she's more talented than the guys were.  (FYI she's NOT a stripper).  The manager came over and told us we couldn't dance up there.  REALLY?  Were we really competition for the guys?  Was he really worried that the other bachelorette parties there were going to start paying us...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review: Either I went on an off night, or not a lot of people know about Wah Kee Noodle. There was only one waiter working, and he was also the host. We ordered N1 and N13 off the house specials page (can't remember the name of N1, but N13 was some kind of spicy vegetable noodle dish). N1 was tasty (wide ride noodles stir fried with beef and bean sprouts) and I would definitely order it again. N13 had a sweet but not spicy sauce, as well as plenty of broccoli, celery, carrots and bean sprouts. Wah Kee says on their menu that they make their own noodles, and it definitely tastes like it. I would recommend ordering off of their house specials page if you have trouble deciding what to get from their 4-5 page menu.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

My dishes always taste great - I just never feel too great later or the next morning.\\n\\nNo matter how good a place's food tastes, it's tough to be convinced to return when all you can remember is how bad you felt later on!

        "Review: 3.5 stars. Nice little place to get good pizza and Greek, albeit Americanized Greek (gyros pitas and salads, calamari, etc.). Pizza is distinct from the rest. Garlicky, so if you like that you will love it.  Crust is delicious.  The penelope is my favorite, but will get just a cheese when I need a cheaper fix. They will only do small pizzas for dine-in.  If you want large you have to take it to go.  Really weird, so we rarely dine in. I'm close by so I've been here a lot and 95% of the time get a consistently good product. But the other 5% unfortunately puts it down a notch to 3 stars. It's a midtown landmark and the best pizza near Woodlea/Melrose. Room for improvement that would boost their score. (Previously mentioned comments, they close too early for a pizza place, got a pizza that was way too salty once, price on many items too high for the quality, some parking area too dark - might make some uncomfortable at night.)\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nAnother 5 star review. I normally don't give high reviews, unless a business deserves it and Discount Tire deserves it.  \\nEarlier today, I took my car to a different DT location because my TPMS was lit for a few days.  I arrived at 5pm and without hesitation, the tech took my car into a bay. To make a long story short, I needed a new sensor. I wanted to purchase 2 of them for my 2 front tires. Unfortunately, they were out stock. Mike, called this store and Mike from this store said that they have the correct sensor and that I can come In at 5:30, even knowing that they close at 6.  Mike from the fist store waived the installation fee. \\n\\nI arrived at the second store and the tech who worked on my car advised me that the lug bolt was stripped by a different location. I mentioned that only DT rotates and checks my tires so most likely it happened almost a year ago at a different DT location.  The manager Mike without hesitation or resistance, said that he will give me a voucher so a mechanic can fix this problem without me being charged. I was very impressed by his actions.\\n\\nWhen the tech finished up the job, a different tire sensor produced a trouble code. The tech diligently took action to trace the problem and replace the additional sensor.\\n\\nI was very impressed with the fast handling of the situation by both locations (the first location I went to was on Jones and Trop).\\n\\nI am a fan for life with DT.  They will rotate your tires for free and other places charge to do that.  Thank you for being my first and only choice for tires.\\n\\nFeel free to pass this letter on to corporate management.\\n\\nThanks.\\nDaniel R.\\nLas Vegas, NV\n\nStars:",

I had never been on the Duquesne Incline (I only moved here a few months ago) and we had a restaurant.com/groupon deal if we spent $50 we would get $25 off.\\n\\nPros - Views views views!  We went at night and the city lights and views were inspiring.\\n\\nAfter the Incline experience that made you feel like you just took a step back in time I found I was able to stay in character at Georgetowne because of its traditional setting.

They happily acknowledged our coupon which is sometimes an issue at restaurants.\\n\\nCons - The meal was not to die for. It was mediocre.

        "Review: I recently had surgery to fuse my lower/lumbar spine.  So I have first hand experience with this facility.\\n\\nThe hospital is extremely well organized, well staffed and amazingly clean.  They are not fooling around with making certain that infections do not happen in their facilities.  They are continually cleaning, hand washing and gloving whenever they were around me.\\n\\nThe patient attention was terrific with at least 30 people a day coming in to see me, cuff me, poke me, wash me, inject me and otherwise \\\"care\\\" for me.  And that first day of consciousness from surgery the physical and occupational therapists were there, getting me out of bed, moving and teaching me how to walk and toilet myself given my now painfully healing back.\\n\\nI was in such pain, having my back opened and another on my side, so my \\\"core\\\" was always necessary to move and that was not fun.  I appreciated the staff's attention to pain relief and keeping me comfortable.\\n\\nI cannot comment on the meals as I was restricted to a \\\"clear\\\" diet.  All three meals consisted of a bowl of chicken broth, a cup of jello and a cup of apple juice.  Oh boy!\\n\\nUpon discharge, the Novant Health System kicked in with home physical therapy and provision of a walker and elevated toilet seat.  It was a good package which I am using now three weeks after the surgery.\\n\\nI cannot think of a better place to have critical surgery done.  It is a orthopedic surgery hospital and that is only what they do.  And they do it well.\\n\\nI would demand to go back to Presbyterian if I need further surgery.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Sure you can order a huge double decker veal parmesan but it was just OK. \\n\\nThe sandwich was served on a half loaf and it was toasted so it was hard as a rock and had to be smashed down causing a plate full of crumbs and crusty bits. \\n\\nThe restaurant is nothing more than a dirty outdated dive bar with sloppy looking employees that don't wear any type of uniform or matching clothing. It's hard to tell who works there and who is just someone trying to get a meal. \\n\\nI don't mean to be hating but I went there once and haven't really wanted or felt the need to go back.

        "We were first timers last night, going to try a new place to celebrate 2 years of marriage, the happiest moments of our lives which included a lot of sushi thus far!  We wanted to sit at bar but only waited about 5 minutes for a family of 4 to skeedaddle.  We were seated in front of Chef Wen, and received great service from 3 different servers.  We received the free hot sake from the yelp check-in, I also had iced green tea and Eric R. had hot green tea.  We also were given complimentary Korean style pancake which was topped with some green onions!\\n\\nWe tried many items that are unique to here.  Unfortunately, the last live uni was ordered when we arrived so I could not try it yet.  However, we kicked off the meal with live scallop.  What is cool is that a chef in the kitchen comes out and shows the live shellfish before preparation.  We inspected our scallop before it was prepared into sashimi cuts, drizzled with yuzu juice (my eyes lit  up when I saw it!), black tobiko, and gold leaf!  It was delicate and delicious, with yuzu as the perfect complement.\\n\\nNext we got hamachi belly nigiri, which was of course fatty deliciousness.  I ordered kohada which was yummy considering I am a big fan of saba.  The cure was similar.  We enjoyed sake with avocado and yuzu.  Eric R. got super white tuna, then I ordered live amaebi which came out to wiggle around on the counter and say hello.  On Chef Wen's recommendation we got blue fin maguro,which was melt-in-your-mouth tender.  I tried an oyster and  then a salmon skin handroll.  Eric R. ordered an over the rainbow roll, which was like a California roll with assorted fish piled on top of the cut roll.  For our anniversary we were treated to free ice cream (plum and vanilla).  I completed the meal with the true dessert, uni nigiri.  Chef Wen topped it with a small piece of ika and some ikura.  I was really impressed.\\n\\nEvery day, the restaurant orders live uni and other hard-to-get treats, so every day there will be different special fish to try.  That alone makes it...

        "Review: I went on the chicken and rib cruise this past Thursday with my girlfriend and another couple.  We had made the reservations by phone and my last name got a little butchered.  After a small but funny kerfuffle we were led to our table as this cruise had assigned seating.\\n\\nEven though our main meal was the Buffett we decided to start off our meal two appetizers, the crab and shrimp dip and antipasti.  The antipasti was nice with a good selection of cheeses, meats and olives while the dip did little to leave an impression on me.  The Buffett had on it vermicelli salad, cole slaw, cornbread, a jumbalaya rice, corn on the cob, roasted red skin potatoes and the chicken and ribs.  Everything was decent with the standout dish for me being the ribs which I slathered in regular BBQ sauce.  After enjoying the BBQ sauce I thought I would try the hot version and was disappointed to find out that meant tobasco added to it. Overall it was a solid meal but nothing special.  The cruising portion was also pretty nice and we all enjoyed going up and down all three rivers while hearing some Pittsburgh history.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I will probably not be back in the future.  The price doesn't justify the cost food wise although I imagine it would be an awesome way to get an out of town guest to experience Pittsburgh.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I will go for Las Vegas Burlesque Live! Otherwise, getting a drink from that lame chick, Marie, is like delivering bad news to someone who's cat just got ran over. What really pisses me off, is the last time I was there, I asked for a cup of water. It was loud due to the live band playing. She brought me a bottle. I politely told her a cup would be fine. The look that bitch gave me...I wanted to slap it right off of her face. First of all, it's your f'n job. Second, I have worked in this biz for over 15 years and I appreciate an upsale. The bar was busy, so it really wasn't necessary. Third, Don't assume a bottle is what I wanted. And then get pissed because I didn't want it after we just bought 5 drinks. You are lame and I will tell everyone I know about you. The owner is super friendly and gets it. She knows what she is there for. I think Marie needs a hug. Even so, it probably wouldn't change her rotten attitude. A few months back, before leaving, I came up and left a tip for the night. It was pretty big. Do you think I got any love? So I haven't left a tip since and she just reinforces my decision. Yay for Cha Cha's Burlesque shows! Boo for the bitter bartender.

We got there early so we could have a leisurely dinner before karaoke. \\n\\nThe saloon wasn't that crowded like two weeks ago yet the service was much slower. We couldn't help noticing two women were seated after we arrived and were immediately given menus while we were still waiting on someone to come take our order.  After waiting some more a gal took our drink orders.  More waiting they were finally delivered to our table. Not long after we got our drinks our waiter came over and took our food order. We all got a hamburger, salad and a small bowl of clam chowder.\\n\\nTo our surprise everything came out all at once. We were not expecting this at all. We even mentioned how disappointed that our food arrived all at once because some of it will get cold by the time were ready to eat it. This complaint seemed to go on deaf ears.  This being said the burgers were good. Nothing to write home about just good.\\n\\nMy wife Carol and Kathy ordered a slice of pie for desert. Carol got he coconut cream pie which she enjoyed. Kathy got the mixed berry pie. She thought it was way to sweet. In fact a few of our friends joined us later one ordered the cherry pie. She commented how over powering sweet it was and didn't finish it.\\n\\nAnother thing to note was no one cleared our plates after dinner. They were piling up. We were constantly moving them to make room at our table. After a while the  people seated next to us finished their meal so we bused our own table and took everything to where they were seated. \\n\\nLater since we stayed for karaoke we ordered potato skins appetizer . They were greasy tasting (I mean how greasy) so we won't be getting them again. YICK!\\n\\nFOOD:  The food was just \\\"ok\\\". Nothing remarkable at all. I expected more e considering the small sample I had on my first of Kathy R's burger.  PRICE: Reasonable. SERVICE:  The service was much slower this time around.  AMBIANCE: An 1800's old western bar.

The woman behind the counter was training a rookie. She got my drink order(two of the same) wrong. When I asked if it was a chai latte she went on this everlasting rant about snobby people and their ridiculous drink orders and just wouldn't stop complaining about her job. She added espresso to make it a latte and then exclaimed it was her last day. I get in my car drive down the road, take a sip and it tasted nothing like my order. The customer service here is laughable, the product knowledge and execution is borderline horrific. Never shopping with them again.

        "11/25/10\\n\\n2.5 stars.\\n\\nWasn't able to secure a reservation at either Chandler's or Ahwatukee's Mimi's Cafe, but I did have two reservations at Rustler's Rooste and McCormick & Schmick's.  Mom didn't relish the thought of having to dine outside at RR's, so M&S it had to be.\\n\\nReservation was for two at 8p, and knowing we'd be slightly tardy (we arrived at 8:05p), I'd called before we left and was told that there wouldn't be any problems keeping the reservation.  It took about 10 minutes to be seated, which wasn't so bad, considering that the hosts seemed disorganized and slightly frantic, and there were about 10 or more people waiting in a scattered formation before us (it was VERY cold outside, and no one wanted to feel the breeze everytime someone opened the doors!).  However, it took another 15 mins. before our server greeted us, which also meant we had to wait that long before getting a sip of water!\\n\\nFood was, on the whole, delicious (w/ a few exceptions), but it was the timing that ruined the experience for us.  After being served water, we both ordered the Turkey dinner, each w/ a choice of side (Mom chose the sweet potato crumble, and I the macaroni and cheese), plus a side salad and dessert (cheesecake or upside-down apple pie- we both chose the pie).  Mom also wanted the calamari app.  How I wished I'd listened to our server when he recommended the crumble over the mac 'n cheese after I'd asked him which was better :(  The SPC was heaven (!), while the mac needed more cooking time.  Even the replacement wasn't any good.  The sliced oven-roasted turkey dinner was terrific, which included mashed potatoes, stuffing, fresh cranberry sauce, crispy green beans, and sliced carrots.  We were served cheesecake, instead of apple pie, and when we nicely pointed out the mistake, we were told that the apple pie would take a little longer as it was still baking, and the cheesecake was taken away.  Mom didn't care for the pie; I, on the other hand, really liked the homemade filling!\\n\\nRun-down of the timing...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nOh, Popo's....  How do I love thee...  Let me count the ways!  having lived in the area for more than 20 years, Popo's has been and likely will always be the best mexican food around.  We worried heavily when they opened their new location at 59th and Bell because it can often signal the beginning of the end (such was the case with Garcia's).  \\n\\nPopo's is a family restaraunt.  A bit rough on the edges with the decor but the food and service are far more worthy of a visit than any decor.  I often look intently at the menu hoping that I would find something that could sway me from my usual choice but I somehow always seem to default to the Chimi dinner.  Sure I would love to try other items but I feel as though I would miss the chimi just a little more.  So, for me it's the chimi dinner with machaca, red sauce, guacamole, and their delicious jalapeno cream cheese.  The machaca (shredded beef) is absolutely amazing and if I could make it myself I would never have to venture out again.  Add to that their salsa (which has the right amount of saltyness and that addictive red hot sauce and you will be set for an incredibly filling and delicious meal.  \\n\\nThe service is exceptional.  Like family really.  The beer is cold and the drink specials are always fun.  We have always had a great time and look forward to each visit.  We have tried many other Mexican places over the years but this place takes the blue ribbon.\\n\\nIncidentally, we have a home in Texas as well and our Mexican food experiences there have been less than spectacular.  The TexMex - Fresh Mex idea is a completely different type of dining and it lacks the depth of flavor and preparation that Popo's is expert at.  \\n\\nFor a south of the border treat, check it out and enjoy!  You won't be disappointed!\n\nReview rating:",

        "Went to the Coin Gallery to sell some coins that had become excess to my collection. I upgraded my collection by purchasing several coins that would replace the ones I wanted to sell. I did my homework by consulting the Coin Dealer Newsletter (known in the hobby as \\\"CDN\\\" or the \\\"Grey Sheet\\\"). It is The Bible of the coin collecting world. According to the latest edition of the \\\"Grey Sheet,\\\" interest in Morgan Silver Dollars (my type of coins) and the prices paid for them was the highest it's been in recent years. According to the CDN, action for Morgans at recent auctions and coin shows in Baltimore, Las Vegas and Long Beach was brisk and represented a renaissance in prices. Like I said, I did my homework.\\n\\nTook a look around the Coin Gallery while I waited for assistance. In display cases, along with a couple of 100 oz silver bars, a number of coins were \\\"slabbed\\\" as in graded by a professional grading service. The coins I saw were graded between AU-58 and MS-63. I also noticed these prices were pretty stiff. \\n\\nI presented my coins and asked if these coins would be candidates for upgrades. After examination, I was told my coins were nice (they were already graded by PCGS as (\\\"Mint State\\\") MS-64 and MS-65 (investment grade coins)). But, they were unlikely to be upgraded. \\n\\nKnowing these coins would be some of the nicest in his shop, I asked if he was interested in purchasing my coins. The counterman stepped away and went into an office. Knowing my individual coins were worth between $92 and $345 EACH (according to the \\\"Grey Sheet\\\"), I expected a substantial offer. Needless to say, I was shocked, almost speechless, when he offered me $110 for a coin the \\\"Grey Sheet\\\" says is worth $345. \\n\\nI tried to engage him, to negotiate. The counterman's excuse for such a low offer and his unwillingness to negotiate? \\\"Morgans aren't selling.\\\" Tell that to the publisher at The Coin Dealer Newsletter and the coin show vendors at Baltimore, Las Vegas and Long Beach. \\n\\nI've bought, sold and traded coins...

Comes with fries.  had a side salad too this time.  A coke and ice tea as well.  The server was very attentive today.  The burgers were super hot off the grill, which is what you like to see.  The pipeline is my favorite.  Chopped chili meat on a burger.  Just a nice thin layer for flavor.  Awesome.

That says something in itself.  You don't stick around as a restaurant and give 'wierd' or poor service and expect to stay in business.  There is only one dish that I get from this place, but not because I don't like the other dishes.  It's the Curried Chicken.  I absolutely love curried chicken and this place has some of the BEST around.  I think people have a bit different feeling of the place because it is oriental type people, read: Asians, that are running the place.  Big deal and so what?  They are nice enough people, they are serving a good product and their prices are reasonable enough.  Go to some of the local Chinese restaurants and then I can start to talk about some weird, odd behavior from staff.  Admittedly, I haven't eaten anything but the curried chicken, so the rest of the menu I really can't comment on.\n\nStars:",

This helps with the wait time immensely.

The menu is exactly the same as Azteca's, so that's a plus, since Azteca is decent, veg-friendly tex-mex. Pretty sure they're all part of the same local chain. Service is always over the top terrific and we end up leaving a 40% tip often since the bill is always so low - the most expensive thing I've ever ordered here was 9.50.\\n\\nChips are good and plentiful. Nothing here is blow you away, but most of it is passable, sometimes even good. Don't order the huevos rancheros - probably the least impressive thing on the menu. \\n\\nMy favs, at both Pedro's and Azteca, are the Enchiladas de Espinaca - rice, beans, and fresh spinach-stuffed flour tortillas smothered in queso sauce.

Have them add some fresh jalapenos for a kick. Its as big as your head, so you'll take some home - fry an egg, stick it on top, you got yourself 3 dollar brekkie.\\n\\nAnd hey, since Skandalos is right next store, you could stuff your face AND see mexican heavy metal, all in one night.

It is spicy enough you don't really want the marinated pork as it's filler, but it is wonderful no matter what you fill it with, the spicy sauce that is poured over it is what maked it.\\n\\nTacos: $1 tacos on Tuesdays!!

        "Super Amazing Wedding Reception Venue!!!! I don't seriously know where to begin. I am soo very THANKFUL I found this gorgeous venue and it was more than I ever imagined my wedding day would be like. Tony and his entire staff exceeded my expectations and that's a true compliment because I am pretty anal. LOL! From how they made no mistakes with my special table decor requests to the food...WOW Super Yummy and Fancy without the crazy \\\"wedding\\\" price. The DJ...the entire staff...were totally professional, very kind and  very helpful ! This is the true jackpot for anyone's wedding.... trust me! Your guest will be more than satisfied!  Make sure you check out the beautiful garden ambience...Breathtaking! Just a side note...I had a previous venue set prior to finding this spot which screwed us by shutting down within months of our wedding so I was very weary of any researching again . After this Experience, I truly  believe Everything Happens for a  GOOD Reason. Miss Tony already!  :)\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: This Wal-Mart can be summed up in one word: Dirty. This has to be the oldest Wal-Mart in the Mesa/Phoenix area and you can tell before you even step foot into the store! For starters, the parking lot looks like a 'stop-n-swap' meet where everyone brings their junk and sets it up in the back of their cars. There is trash everywhere and everything is rundown. Then you go into the store and the flooring is old and gross, the lighting is bad and it has a weird smell. \\n\\nIf you happen to need something and you can't find another store near by, this Wal-Mart still has great Wal-Mart prices and the people working and shopping there are really nice. BUT! Do not use their self checkouts!! You have been warned! Here's what happened to me: \\n\\nI scanned two items that I kept in the cart so I pushed that \\\"I do not want to bag this item\\\" twice, the scanner was having a really hard time picking up the bar codes so I had to very slowly repeat my waiving motion over the lasers. Any ways, I get to my next item and it's super light so when I put it in the bag it was like \\\"would you like to bag this item\\\" and since it wasn't picking it up, I just hit the \\\"I do not want to bag this item\\\" button again. Well...that was the 3rd item I didn't want to bag so it triggered an alert and I needed a 'Store log in\\\" The attendant was helping someone else so I sat there...and sat...until the guy came and fixed it for me. Then I got to scan my next item (super glue) - I guess super glue is a controlled item because, again, I needed an override. Okay, I finish up checking out and request $100 back...bad idea I come to find out - the machine only gives me half the change in $10s, but it's still making noises like it's trying to get money out to me. I call my helper over and he kicks the machine and it shoots out two $5s...the thing sounds like it's dying...so my helper calls over to a coworker, who comes over and says \\\"Well you've got to kick it, did you kick it yet\\\" So apparently this happens a lot. I think at the thought of being...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I was travelling with my wife and my little dog who I had paid $100 to travel on the airline but was turned away from the Club which I had also paid for last year as a Dividend Miles member.   I find it distasteful that my liittle dog in an appropriate travel bag is excluded when loud, unsanitary children are allowed in the Club.

The ambiance was nice--very old school Vegas--an older clientele. Lots of Rat Pack Music going. The service was fine, however we were disappointed in the food. My petite filet was cold and although it was cooked medium rare, like I had ordered, the cut of meat was not good. It seemed like a cheaper grade of beef than we had been served before at the Golden Steer. Also, I ordered fries that were supposed to be home cut, but were obviously frozen. My broccoli was raw. For the price we paid, we will have to reconsider & perhaps choose a more modern steakhouse with higher standards.\n\nReview rating:",

Sad part is delivery stops at 8:45pm - so not good for late night cravings.\\n\\nI had the shrimp scampi that came with pasta --- more like pasta that came with 8 little overcooked shrimp, but it scratched that buttery itch for the most part, although very heavy on the oil factor. Other people got a salad, a sub, and something on a burger bun (sorry, I was hungry and didn't pay enough attention!) \\n\\nFor an app, someone ordered fried calamari, and although the ticket even said that, they brought us fried mushrooms. One quick phone call, one quick apology, and sent a driver right over with fresh fried calamari (plus we got to keep the mushrooms, which were fried tasty goodness!) --- that my friends is what good delivery service does when someone messes up, and for that, I will happily order from them again (can you tell I've had a bad experience?

When we walked in there was only one other customer with her baby but we didn't think much of it because it was a holiday and most businesses were dead.\\n\\nThey didn't have much selection but I went with the bbq chicken sandwich, and my friends got the beef ribs and brisket.  Nothing was fantastic.  \\n\\nMy bbq chicken sandwich was dry... I had to pour on bbq sauce.  I guess they forgot that it was a BBQ sandwich.  My friends ribs were unsatisfactory... mainly just a big bone with lots of fat.  She tried her best to get good meat off of it but it was scarce.  The brisket was not what I think of when I think of brisket.  I think of tender meat that melts in your mouth.... this just looked like roast beef on a plate.  \\n\\nI got a side order of cornbread but it was so dry that I couldn't get much of it down :(  So sad because I looooove cornbread.\\n\\nWe also got dessert- peach cobbler.

I don't think that I opened a door myself, lifted a buffet warmer, wiped off my own exercise equipment or looked for a conference room without an escort.  One evening we were having a reception out on the golf course (not the best plan in AZ in the winter) and the sprinklers went on.  Hotel staff literally dove to position their bodies in front of the sprinklers so that we wouldn't get wet - now that's customer service.  Overall the rooms and grounds were well maintained, but starting to show their age, with dated colors and patterns. \\n\\nWith the growth of Phoenix as a city, the resort no longer has a secluded feel - as it's now surrounded by miles of strip malls and chain restaurants. \\n\\nI'd definitely return to the Wigwam for a conference.

I work in the medical field so my frustration was even higher. I arrived 20 needs early as requested when I made my appointment. I had previously filled out my paperwork so I was ready to go. My appointment time came and an hour and 20 minutes later I still had not been seen. I went to speak to the receptionist who was quite rude and said \\\"Well, you're next\\\" in a very snippy tone. I waited 20 more minutes then was called back. The medical assistant did not introduce herself, she just started tugging at my arm to get a blood pressure. It was of course really high because I was angry. When the PA came in, she listened and was patient with my concerns. We had a nice conversation about what I was needing. This made me think maybe the wait was worth it. She left and said the doctor will be here soon. I waited about 15 more minutes for the Dr. Mishra, she came in and abruptly started telling me what she wanted to do, didn't listen to anything I said, made rude comments about my weight, told me I need bariatric surgery because I \\\"won't be able to maintain long term weight loss without it.\\\" Sounds like she has a lot of faith in her patients. Then suggested medications that aren't used for my disease, she said she was putting me on a list of meds and doing 10 different lab tests. Then she got up and walked out. I spent maybe 4 or 5 minutes max with her.  I didn't not have a chance to ask her any of my questions, she didn't write any of the prescriptions she mentioned. When I asked about the scripts, they told me she was with another patient and would call me. I highly doubt that. I felt brushed off and really insulted.

After I tasted it, I can taste the syrup flavor in the coffee, I asked for no flavor because I know they would put something like syrup in it and they screwed something this easy.  Starbucks need to retrain their baristas to make sure they can listen better.  I went around lunch time but the store wasn't all that busy at all.  They need to pay more attention on what the customers need and not just about how much money they can get from it.

Sorry mam, you will have to pack up this very large and heavy item and set it out to be picked up. Have spent a lot of $$$$ and would have had better service and products had I gone to Walmart. They used to be a great company, I have been brought to tears and all I have gotten is a smug and condescending attitude. When I complained to one of the online managers and explained my disappointment with he had no sensitivity to all I have been through and at one point even tried to point the finger back at me. At one point told him I would be telling everyone I came in contact with and the internet media how horrible my experience has been, his reply \\\" Do what you have to do!\\\" Wow, were has customer service gone?\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nWorst experience with Papa Johns ever with this location. \\n\\nEvery* time I've ordered delivery it has been incredibly late. This past time was the worst. An order estimated at 30 minutes still wasn't here 1.5 hours later so I called and they claimed it had just left. They called up from the call box once and then left within seconds. (For whatever reason it went straight to voicemail, which I got notification of immediately.) I literally ran down and circled the lot and they were long gone. The store then pretended they couldn't hear me when I called from numerous phones and numbers until finally I interrupted their speech about the promotion and called them out for stuttering since they clearly heard me. (Before that they'd say the special really fast and immediately say \\\"hello? hello?\\\" and hang up.) I will never order from this location again.\n\nReview rating:",

The management was unprofessional and uncaring, and blamed him for bringing them. It was funny he moved straight from his parents home and NEVER had them. They sprayed, and he was put out again , after a few days he was bitten AGAIN.

I'm not saying it's the best gyro I've ever had, nor am I saying it's the cheapest (around $9 total), but it gets the job done.  \\n\\nI usually get the single gyro meal when I go.  The fries are the thick cut super crispy kind, and the gyros are cooked well, with plenty of sauce (not sure what people are saying about it being dry, my hand's are always a mess after eating one of these), and onions and tomatoes to boot.

        "Unlike some of the flea markets I've been to this one stands out at being one of the best albeit for one I went to in Pasadena Calif. many years ago.   First of all, there is no fee for parking or an entrance fee.  So this is a big plus for me.  It was jammed packed with cars but with patience you get a parking spot pretty quickly.  Apparently they added another day to it.  Now it includes Fridays as well.  So it goes on all year from Friday to Sunday.  A really great way to spend a couple of hours browsing through the covered tents.   It looks to be around 1/2 mile long with about 4 aisles packed with \\\"stuff\\\".  It's basically the usual stuff you get almost everywhere. Tee's, Sweatshirts, leather goods, shoes, tools, jewelry cleaners, jewelry,  loads of foods vendors and a great big food court.  Not my cup of tea, but it is available.  I'm not a golfer, but lots of booth with  clubs etc.  Chatchkas (Yiddish) word for a lot of \\\"things\\\"some useful and some not.  It's great if you want to get some exercise and walk for a couple of hours and have some fun wandering about.  They even had some cheese made in Arizona like the Wisconsin cheddar.  Something a friend of mine from Wisconsin used to bring back for me. They are small pieces that just melt in your mouth.   Didn't have a cooler so didn't pick it up.  Overall a good place to pass some time and get off your butt.\nSo I would like to give it",

Yea technically i know but after 45 min of it, when the whole restaurant is visibly uncomfortable the staff should have requested the child be taken outside. Food was okay, nothing spectacular and that damn screaming kid...Jesus people, Chucky Cheese is at the other side of the shopping center. \\nSo, i didn't diss the restaurant due to that experience. Went back a few weeks later. Christmas Day actually. Twas earlier in the day so it wasn't super busy yet. The table beside us was already noticeably frustrated with service and wait for their food when we arrived(they eventually ended up almost walking out). Good sign right, lol? Well everything was kinda disappointing. Service was shotty, food wasn't that good(or hot) and took forever to get to the table. It felt like asking for a refill was an annoyance to the server.

They don't taste very authentically Italian, but they make for a good cheap lunch on days I forget to pack something. I probably wouldn't eat here if it weren't for their convenient location. There's also free parking in the back, so +1 for that.\\n\\nThe variety of pasta they have is amazing. Very authentic and pretty reasonably priced. They have packaged gnocchi that's awesome and turns out perfect and fluffy every time. Much better than big brand gnocchi you find at other grocery stores like Trader Joe's. I love that they have a wide selection of arborio rice to make risotto. Usually arborio is hard to find in this town. \\n\\nTo comment on their sauces: I made spaghetti with their house-made spaghetti sauce and it tasted sort of funny. It kind of tasted like tomato soup, but with the consistency of pasta sauce. Weird. They had some different fancyish brands of pasta sauce that I've been wanting to try. \\n\\nAll of their sweet items (chocolates, cookies, cannolis, etc.) seem WAY overpriced. The Ritter bars are like $4.50, and I can get those for about $2.50 at TJ's. Similarly, I noticed that the Lindt chocolate bars are double the price you'd pay elsewhere. Try to avoid the sweet items here, unless you're looking for an italian brand that you absolutely can't find anywhere else. I'm intrigued by their frozen section. They have lots of frozen pizzas/pastas that look yummy but I have yet to try any.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The lighting is dim and combined with an option for a booth this could be a great place to take a date.\\n\\nPerhaps I have not dined here repeatedly to receive that \\\"Cheers\\\" type greeting I've heard so much about, but all in all the service was slightly above Vegas's standard, mediocre.  A few cheesy jokes warmed up our waiter and it was smooth sailing the rest of our meal.\\n\\nCocktails were strong, bread was warm, mozzarella and tomatoes were fresh, and my chicken picatta was delightful.  \\n\\nWould I categorize this meal as award winning, not really but would I eat here again, sure if my first two picks happened to be crowded. I just felt that for the price, just about $20 per entree (non-meats/seafood), you could get a very similar dish down the street (Black Mtn. Grill or Gaetanos) for less.

It comes with diced ham, sausage, bacon, hashbrowns, eggs, and cheese. I always add gravy to it and its about $5.25 after tax, really good considering its an entire breakfast in a burrito. For lunch and dinner the burger special can't be beat. But all in all most everything here is good especially if you stick to the traditional american food.

        "Ian's has to be one of the most overrated pizza places I've ever been to -- Heck, I think most of the restaurants in Madison are ridiculously overrated. Maybe I am in the minority as a couple others might say, but some of Ian's \\\"unique\\\" pizzas are pretty disgusting (take the Cordon Bleu flavor for one, I couldn't even eat a bite of it without gagging). I also have an issue with the price -- The slices are rather small, but then again, I'm not sure if I want a big slice of Mac and Cheese pizza anyway.\\n\\nThe only charm to this place is the novelty of the awful pizzas (and the fact that they can make a halfway decent traditional pizza), but if anyone wants Ian's again, I'm running out!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nI've been coming here for many years now and have no complaints about the hibachi grill food. It's always fresh and good! Whenever I'm in the mood for Japanese and have approx 1 hour to enjoy my lunch (and have a healthy appetite!) I come here on my lunch break. The noodles are by far my favorite part of the meal, I just love them! I've had the chicken, shrimp, steak, scallops  over the years many times and they've all been delicious. Fried rice is super yummy too but is an up charge - $2 I think? (outside of lunch hours) which I think is crazy. Other places in the area don't do this and I think it's just a way for them to make an extra buck. I do pay it though bc I really like the fried rice. Unless you really want an alcoholic beverage save your $$, the beer on tap is often flat and mixed drinks are expensive and nothing that great. I'm not a huge sake fan but it's your average sake. The chefs are so-so, of course they can cook! But I like a show...it's hit or miss if you get a good one. They do good for coming out, talking with you, making adjustments, etc. Wait staff is pretty good but there are some bad ones as with all restaurants. If you get a good/great chef & waitress please tip them well (20%) as they share with each other. I do think that's fair as we out the chef through some grief at the table! \\nCan't speak on the sushi as surprisingly I've never had theirs...but looks like others have so be sure to read their reviews! \\nOn Friday & Saturday nights you will have a long wait so I'd recommend a reservation, even if it's just 2 of you, which will get you placed in a sectioned off portion where you have to take off your shoes...be forewarned! All tables seat about 10 on each side so you'll sit with strangers if you don't have a large group. \\n\\nEnjoy!\n\nStars:",

        "Review: Took mom out to lunch and told her to pick some place downtown we've never been before. She chose this one based on the history. After reading some of the reviews here, I was a bit apprehensive but decided to give it a go anyway as I was interested in the history of the place as well.\\n\\nI'm not sure what everyone was complaining about now. Sure, it's not fancy or modernized but it was clean, we were seated and served quickly, and it filled both of us up for under $20. I got the combo No. 4 platter with chow mein, fried rice, sweet and sour pork and an eggroll. The plate was full and I wasn't able to finish! The eggroll was a little too ginger-y but was large and tasty and the pork and chow mein were both really good and fresh. The fried rice was a bit plainer than I'm used to (no veggies or egg) but was still tasty. Mom got the pork lo mein and the plate was heaping - she also couldn't finish.\\n8 hours later and I feel great, if a little sad I didn't take some of the leftovers home. No ill effects like some reviews below stated.\\n\\nI suppose if you go to a restaurant for a specific atmosphere, you're going to leave dissatisfied even with good food. However, I could care less about that - I'm at a restaurant to eat, not stare at the walls around me. This place is definitely worth it if you want some fast and cheap Chinese food downtown.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

(Sorry, I do not consider Pei Wei Asian food) I had heard about this place and always wondered about the dinky place with the blue awning. \\n\\nFirst off, I was impressed for a mom-and-pop place with a drive-thru window, it was pretty immaculate. I noticed while sitting down to wait for my order, there wasn't a crumb on any empty table. The woman behind the counter was friendly and seemed to know a lot of the people coming through. \\n\\nAs for the food, I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted my chicken teriyaki vegetable bowl with brown rice. The chicken wasn't drenched in an overly sweet sauce like a lot of Japanese places. It had this smoky flavor like it had been on the grill, not something I'm used to with teriyaki. I certainly didn't mind it. Also, the cabbage, carrots, etc. had some flavor to them and they didn't taste like they had been overcooked or terribly greasy like at a Panda Express. I felt full afterward, but not in a gross \\\"I ate too many onion rings\\\" kind of way. The bowl cost about $6.50 which I consider reasonable. The place also has a watercooler where you are free to fill 'er up. When the cashier wasn't busy, she came around and grabbed my cup to refill it for me. Nice touch. \\n\\nNow, I gave it four stars not because I'd call it a four-star restaurant but for what it offers considering it's \\\"fast food\\\" and for the good manners. I'll definitely come again. I could see meeting someone there for lunch or hogging a table just to read a book in between noshing on teriyaki.\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nI've driven by here a few times, but this weekend decided to take the plunge.  I'm so glad I did.\\n\\nComedor Guadalajara's exterior is pretty unassuming.  Looks like a brownish/pinkish box.  Once you walk in, you can see that while they have some nice Mexican items, let's just say you won't be paying for the decor.  When I went by Sunday afternoon their after church crowd was huge.  I was just getting mine to go luckily.  I didn't hear anyone quoted more than a 10-15 min wait - and some of those were crowds of 8-10.  Walking through the restaurant - it's huge!  There is so much seating I can understand why it was the go to spot.  \\n\\nAlso, I loved the mix of folks.  There was this guy in a cowboy hat, plaid shirt w/ jeans tucked into his cowboy boots standing right next to a guy in a full suit w/ a snazzy tie and shiny shoes.  It was really a great snapshot of Downtown/Southern Phoenix.  So yea, there were like 2 white groups.  But the rest of this place was a somewhere in the brown scale.  Black, Hispanic and mixed folks all hanging out waiting for the food.  To me, this is a good sign.  \\n\\nThe Chicken Chimi was absolutely amazing.  Some of the most flavorful chicken pieces with lots of red & green pepper and onions.  I also tried their Pechuga Asado which was really good.  3 lunch meals, plus a 60 cent \\\"to go charge\\\" (weird, huh?) came out to $35.19.  We will definitely be going back again next time to try all their amazing seafood platters.  While they looked outstanding, I didn't think they were quite \\\"to go\\\" kind of food.  Something to look forward to next time...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I suggest trying the Lau-Lau plate. I'd say the prices are pretty reasonable for a quick fix of islander food. \\n\\nThe parking is plenty. And it's huge for having a family side and a party side.

        "Review text:\nI had a new experience today.  For the first time in my 4 decades of life, I left a restaurant without eating there because I was mad,  and it was this Chompie's.\\n\\nI was actually looking for a location to host a Meetup group that I'm the organizer for.  I saw that Tuesday was \\\"Kids Eat Free\\\" night so my 2 1/2 year old son and I went to check it out.  It was a beautiful night and we wanted to sit outside.  The tables were all set up on the patio  but apparently the server did not want us to eat outside because she was training someone and it would make it harder.  Our hostess went and asked another server, who also was not able or willing to serve us outside.  So, our options were to eat inside or to get it as takeout and sit out on one of the picnic-like tables outside without service.  We elected for the takeout, even though it was not the most convenient thing in the world to juggle the food with a toddler clinging to my leg.\\n\\nWhen I went to pay for the takeout, I was charged for the Kids Meal, too.  I brought up the \\\"Kids Eat Free\\\" and she said that was only for dining in, but she would ask the manager because of our circumstance.  She came back and said no, that the Kids Meal would not be free.  I think she was actually trying, the only person there I can say that about.\\n\\nBy that point, I was so annoyed that we went to Sprouts, got some nice, fresh strawberries, and went home, made our own sandwiches and opened a can of soup.  Probably healthier anyway, though I had been looking forward to trying the Reuben and the matzo ball soup.\\n\\nI'd imagine they didn't care much because I was not a big ticket customer with one adult and a free Kids Meal.  But with that experience, there is absolutely no way I will go back, much less host a large group there.  I called Paradise Bakery and they have a room we can reserve if we have enough people.  Problem solved.\n\nReview rating:",

Pi\\u00f1a Colada is the way to go!  The syrup is all natural, none of that scary artificial stuff. Denise was very friendly and welcoming. She actually takes the time to shave the ice and is not stingy with the flavoring. As I waited around I noticed the different water bottles from liters to gallons. One caught my eye of course, perfect size for my workout days. She even took the wrapper off, rinsed and filled it with ice cold water.  AND, I can stop in at any time for a 35cent refill. Can I do that anywhere else? Nope. Thanks Denise.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nThe location isn't far from where I live... I'm between a couple of locations but prefer this one.  Everyone talks about the parking, etc. but I tend to try and shop when others don't in order to avoid that whole situation.  If you can make it on a week day (especially mid-day) or earlier on the weekends it's really not that bad.  The gas station is great!  I honestly have never had to wait more than a couple of minutes to get to the pump and the prices are what you'd expect of Costco.\\n\\nCustomer service wise, they aren't that great - but it's a warehouse and honestly, I'm just trying to get in and out of there and never really peruse much.  The produce is fresh and it's a great place to pick up the necessities you don't mind buying in bulk.  Since I'm single and live alone I tend to drift a lot more towards things such as cleaning items and toiletries as well as other items I frequently use such as batteries, spinach or non-perishables like pasta.  Frozen items are great as well and I gravitate toward the fruit to make smoothies.  Their return policy is unparalleled and their book section is nice.  I love indulging in a cookbook every once in a while when I go in!\\n\\nThis location does have a pharmacy, food court, optical department, and tire service center but I have yet to utilize those services.  I am a fan of the place and will surely keep up my membership there.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I thought maybe they had an off day or even an off month??\\n\\nThough the interior is on point, they are lacking in the very place that needs to shine.\\nThe food quality is absolutely horrendous. Every time I have ordered any kind of burger the middle is pink and even RED. I didn't know fast food restaurants could cook their burgers at different temperatures (sarcasm)! And whenever I have mentioned it to the manager and staff they seem uninterested and like it's MY FAULT. \\n\\nEnter today's visit, which was from the pick-up window:\\n \\nOn my order was the 4 piece nuggets, a double stack, a frosty and a strawberry lemonade. First the nuggets were NOT cooked all the way through because they were jelly like and the breading was very light in color, as if they took them out of the oil WAY too fast. The double stack meat tasted old and the bun was very hard and unpleasant. The frosty was rancid and I had to throw it away, not even 2 scoops I took. And the worst part was the strawberry lemonade! It was GROSS, and extremely watered down. I've seen the process of the drink and it's not rocket science. How hard is it to put strawberry puree, ice and lemonade into a drink??!! \\n\\nNEVER EVER going back! The staff needs to be RE-TRAINED or taught some common sense. Maybe the staff is too young? Or the management is not doing a good job hiring employees. Something needs to be done to fix the problems. Not only is this bad for the company but bad on the consumer who WILL get sick if things aren't fixed. \\n\\nNext time, don't worry so much about having a fireplace in your establishment and worry more about the food quality and service standards, Wendy's!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "So I need a haircut.  And in a Costco in southeast Phoenix, where I live, I see this gentleman about my age (senior) sporting a really good do.  I ask him who does his hair, and he gives me the same of Sandy Clark at Salon Boulevard.  I call Sandy and make an appointment for 3:15 on Wednesday June 4. \\n\\nToday (Wednesday June 4) I roll out, leaving plenty of time for the 20-mile-odd trip, but Sandy's directions are so bad that I spend almost 20 extra minutes trying to find the Salon. \\n\\nAt 3:15, the moment I realize I'm going to be late, I call the number Sandy gave me; the same one I used for the appointment.  It's her cell phone, and it goes to voicemail.  I leave a message explaining I will be a few minutes late. \\n\\nAt 3:30 I call again.  I get voicemail again. I  leave a second message explaining that I am cruising the parking lot unsuccessfully, but nonetheless on my way, when I spot the Salon.  It's minuscule, and tucked away in a dark corner with tiny signs to identify it. At 3:35 I am inside. \\n\\nSandy, however, has left.  Deciding within 10 minutes that I would be a no show, and not bothering to check her phone, she trotted off to do something far more important than attend to a paying customer with a reservation: you know, someone who might easily have become a repeat customer who brings his own friends in.   \\n\\nInstead, she gets this sucky review on Yelp!, plus warnings to all my personal friends, colleagues and business associates to stay away from her and from Salon Boulevard.  Oh, and on Facebook too.  What her hairdressing skills are like I can not personally vouch for ... but if she loses focus this easily, I guess I'm glad I never had the opportunity to find out. \\n\\nThe lady behind the counter tried to offer me another appointment with Sandy Clark on some future day, but given the above -- plus I don't see the point in another 40-plus-mile, possibly pointless round trip -- I won't be showing up there again. Ever.\\n\\nAnd in my opinion, neither should you.  \\n\\n(Tabitha, where are you?...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "You know when you drink all night and your (hopefully) sober driver reminds you that hangover-prevention starts with putting something in your stomach, but the only place open is the sketchy Jack-in-the-Box with no lights in the parking lot, but you're so drunk you don't care?  That pretty much sums up my attitude about this place when I'm in dire need of my daily caffeine dosage.\\n\\nI've never had a good experience at any of these locations.  The good ole caffeine-driven coffee shop welcome has been replaced with a 30 second delay that allows the barista to finish their conversation before they drag their feet over to the counter to greet you with a \\\"what can I get for you\\\" in a not-so-well-hidden tone of inconvenience. \\nThis definitely puts the mediocre coffee miles ahead of the staff.  And if you think \\\"triceratips\\\" is a clever play on words, think again, it's only because tips here are clearly prehistoric.  \\nBut hey, if you're into the raised-brow of judgment when you order a large, not realizing it doubles as a non-biodegradable tent for 5, you're really going to love this place.  \\n\\nThe only good thing is that the setup isn't over-the-top and cheesy.  It's a pretty comfortable atmosphere to relax and read or visit with someone.  But be warned that if you sit at a table that hugs the bar, the bar patrons are going to read that 50 Shades of Gray over your shoulder, or watch \\\"Chocolate Rain\\\" on your phone with you.

        "I went in there, as a first time customer.  Decent gel manicure.\\n\\nWhen I went to pay, she claimed that she was having trouble with the machine, brought me out a garbled-looking receipt, where I couldn't make out any numbers, yet the line to sign was clear,  and that she needed to re-do my charge card.  I was having the feeling that I was going to be double-billed, and said to her, I better not be double-charged, which is exactly what happened.  I went in there with both of my receipts (the garbled one, and the 'clear' one), and told them that it had shown up on my credit card statement as a 'double billing', exactly how I thought it would be.  They asked me to provide them with a bank statement - which I did, with all the personal information blacked out.  What a pain in the butt to get a refund!!   When I presented all of that, I was told the manager wasn't in, and she was the only one that could issue me a refund.  And to come back (like I've got all the time in the world, to do that!).\\n\\nForget that - I called my credit card company, and they took off one of the charges!!\\n\\nI WILL NEVER go back there again, for the poor way that I was treated, when it was their mistake.\\n\\nI don't care about their spa pedicure prices or anything else.  You only have one chance to make a good 'first' impression -- major FAIL!!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "This place used to be amazing but over the past two years they have slipped.  They used to have excellent service but this has slipped the most.  They seemed to have replaced older, more seasoned staff with younger less experienced. I do still go an had a waiter the other day that was excellent so perhaps I just got unlucky a few times.  The biggest slip is that the place is not kept very well.  It seems like they have given up trying to keep the dining room clean.  It gets worse and worse and it looks like everything is grimy.  \\n\\nThe wings and food are usually good here.  The wings can be great if you ask them to cook them crispy.  The hot are hotter than most so be careful.  Great happy hour prices and beer specials.  Be sure to get the fish tacos if they have them.  \\n\\nIf you have loud kids this is a great place.  It is VERY loud and nobody will hear them.  They  also can throw their peanuts on the floor so that will keep them busy for a while.  Great family place.\nSo I would like to give it",

I decided to join LA Fitness and began seriously working out at this location to shed some  serious pounds. The gym itself is fairly large and has a lot of equipment but has some drawbacks. First, the place is very dirty and until recently didn't offer any sort of sanitation for the machines or weights. In the summer, or whenever it's warm, the air conditioning seemed to be jacked up making the facility uncomfortably warm, which only encourages more sweating.  The televisions upstairs are a joke... the screens must be 13\\\" if that. Add on the weird crap going on in the men's locker and that was enough for me to find another gym. So, other than the few distractions, I felt comfortable working out here and didn't feel like I had to impress anyone.

I got there at lunch time and there was a line halfway into the seating area but it wasnt a long wait to order, maybe 5 min.\\n\\nI had previously looked at some reviews here and because of THAT, I ordered a small bowl of Chicken Tortilla soup ($2.99) and the before mentioned fish taco (Reg $1.99...wt coupon .99). The Total wt tax came to $4.30.\\n\\nThis is a few steps up from Taco Bell and the plates I saw being served looked really good & healthy. My taco was very small and not a good value at the reduced fare of .99. It was good but the Fish Taco's for .99 at Long John Silvers are way better & bigger. Now when it comes to soup, I am spoiled rotten, as I worked at a condo and the Chef there was a Pro and in fact was once Tommy Lasorda's personal Chef, and the soup this guy made was the MOST AWESOME EVER!!\\n\\nThe Tortilla soup was NOT as good as reviewers made it out to be. First off the portion didnt match the price of $3. I have had Campbell's Chunky Mexican Chk Soup ($1.50) that is a bigger portion for less and packs more overall flavor. It was \\\"OK\\\" at best and did have some nice chunks of chicken but not worth $3.\\n\\nI'm not writing this place off by any means and will probably go back using it again as a destination on a walk one day and try the Chicken Tortilla Salad. But for value's sake, I could have paid another dollar & gone to lunch at Buffet @ Asia (see previous review here) & had more of a choice of dishes & all you can eat.\\n\\nWay better than Taco Bell or Del Taco thats for sure!!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review: Why order a sanwich, a side of fries and cole slaw when everything can come in one on the cheap?\\n\\nI was in town for a conference at William Penn and made a point to check out Primanti after learning about their sandwiches from Samantha L. Conveniently located nearby the conference hotel on the other side of Macy's, the place is right off a small tunnel and somewhat easy to miss. The decor was interestingly rugged hole in the wall and reminds me of a no-nonsense working class diner with a few small wobbly tables, napkin dispensers and conventional condiments dispersed throughout.\\n\\nIt was already 2pm and my good friend from Texas and I were starving all day so our expectation was fairly high. My order of knockwurst sandwhich ($5.79) came with two thick slices of soft white bread with sliced knockwurst, cheese, cole slaw, special sauce, and a huge load of french fries tightly stacked in between. At first it looked like a tall order to finish it, but the delicious spongy white bread made it easy. I'm a big sausage fan but would have preferred something other than their knockwurst. Otherwise, the blend of melted cheese on square-shaped hearty fries and slightly tart and the not too saucy pickled slaw made it a sinful and yet delightful experience. \\n\\nAlbeit the interesting concept, it was nonetheless a heart clogging meal so thank goodness that I don't have access to this type of sandwiches all the time. It is still a must try however, for any first time visitors to Pittsburgh. Service was brief and straight forward and my food was served on a paper plate. Thanks Samantha, for the wonderful recommendation! 3 stars for the worthwhile experience. I hope to be back.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Biscuit seemed to be on the dry side, and the gravy was like some kind of gel?? Not much taste. I did however really enjoyed their pancakes!

But, I passed and found some broiled chicken and also took a few cuts from the carving station.  My buddy took full advantage of the buffet.

We wanted to go somewhere both casual and inexpensive, and La Feria definitely is both of those things.  We almost didn't find it - it's upstairs above Pamela's.  Pamela's was closed of course, but all the lights were on, and we eventually figured out to ascend the staircase and seek out La Feria. \\n\\nThere was only one other table of diners, so it was very quiet in the eating area.  There are about 15 tables, and there are boldly colored Peruvian crafts everywhere you look!  We all decided to order lemonade and limeade, which was a great choice.  The drinks were refreshing and fresh, not too sour or too sweet.\\n\\nI ordered one of the daily specials, which was chicken in a spicy peanut sauce.  It came with white rice, a green salad (with two kinds of cheese, two tomatoes slices, an olive, red onion, walnuts, and light dressing), and two slices of French bread.  The chicken itself was great - the sauce had a delicious peanut flavor and it went wonderfully with the rice.  I really liked the salad as well because the dressing was flavorful and I looooove cheese.  The bread was pretty standard, so I used it for dipping in leftover peanut sauce.  Nom!  My boyfriend got the ropa vieja sandwich, which I tasted.  Not as much meat as I'd like, but it was very juicy and flavorful.  Also the sweet potato chips that came on the side were totally addicting!\\n\\nFor dessert, we had a few shortbread cookies with what seemed like dulce de leche on them.  Everyone really enjoyed their meal.  It just feels like a good place to spend your money.  It's small, it's cheap, it's interesting food, and all their crafts are lovely and very affordable.

Accordingly, Phoenicians tend not to crank the air conditioners down to the frosty extremes familiar to folks in more temperate climates. Besides, it's a \\\"dry heat\\\", right? So you learn how to accommodate a looser, somewhat warmer definition of \\\"room temperature\\\" when you live here.\\n\\nI discovered that in order to be comfortable in my own home on hot summer nights, I immediately have to strip off my workclothes and promptly don my woobs. Woobs is a word I stole from Kevin Smith (of Clerks fame) for your lounge-around pajama-like comfy cozy clothes. And the more ventilated the woobs the better... so I discovered the appeal of tank tops, pajama shorts, and flip flops.\\n\\nI needed some more inventory to add to my woobs wardrobe, and had a helluva time locating tank tops (not undershirts) without ridiculous corporate logos or graphics. Some department stores seem to not carry them at all... I guess wife-beating isn't as popular as it once was. It suddenly flashed on me that this would possibly be an item they sold at Old Navy, since most of their clothing is affordable and fairly straightforward, fashion-wise.\\n\\nI did find men's tank tops in my size at Old Navy, so that was a plus. However, these were a little more of a scoop neck that I really prefer--and a mite snug for someone of my rotundity. Out of sheer desperation to add more pairs to the rotation, I bought two shirts (whose gonna see me in my PJs anyhow?). Unfortunately, after washing, these shirts got even tighter and appear even more low cut than when I tried them on the store. Now when I try them on, I see an oafish Freddy Mercury wannabe looking back at me (hairy chest resplendent!). Only when my looser, less flamboyant sleeveless shirts are in the wash do I now even dare to wear my Old Navy purchases. Clothing shopping lesson...\n\nReview rating:",

        "I would give them a 0 if I could. I'm going to Red Robin many dozens of times over the years. I thought I had gone for the last time but decided one more try. I had a salad and onion rings and iced tea. The only thing colder than the salad of the onion rings was the ice tea. The chicken in the salad was rubbery and cold so were the onion rings the only thing getting more at the Red Robin is the cost that's it I'll never go again\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Probably one of the worst tasting food places I have ever had. I am use to BD's so I knew the routine already and since I was new to this particular Mongolian place, I decided to go with the sauce called \\\"Chef's special.\\\" I loaded my bowl up with steak and chicken with a lot of veggies. Picked a few seasonings I use at home and at other places. The sauce bowl was huge which made me think they weren't flavorful if you needed 12 ladles in order to make the good good. The meat was very tough, the taste of the completed dish tasted old, freezer burned, bland, and generic. I was I pleased with the food, but the service was decent considering they don't spend much time interacting with their customers. Waste of money. \\n\\n***edited a few hours later\\nA business owner saw this review and was very professional, I will give it another chance bc of the great customer service after my experience, that's how successful business's operate.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

My only issue is the last time I was there with my 9 year old, she said he had three very small cavities & wanted to fix them immediately.  I said no! She said if he's very diligent brushing his teeth then they won't progress. They won't disappear but they won't progress. Well 6 months later they won't take my insurance without a referral from a regular dentist. I take my son to my dentist to get a referral, they give him a checkup, cleaning,  and x rays. There are NO cavities! I told the dentist that he should have 3! He takes more detailed x rays...NO CAVITIES!!  So, now my son goes to my dentist.\n\nReview rating:",

        "I agree with the poster who says it has gone down hill in the last year. We used to go every Saturday for a muffin and coffee. Currently I will not even eat a muffin there because they keep them out on the counter, uncovered, right by the cash registers for anyone to touch, sneeze on, drop money on, etc. Maybe I'm a little obsessive,  but I have to imagine there are other OCDs that feel the same. Last weekend we were there and people paying for their meals hover directly over the muffins and croissants, talking over them and brushing up against them. I wonder how much spit spray ends up on those by the end of the day? I asked if they had any muffins on trays in the back, but they were all up front. Gross! Plus the muffins are much smaller than they used to be.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "I am loving my new neighborhood Chinese joint, China Garden. I am giving them 5 stars for tasty food at a great price with very excellent accomodating service (not grading for ambiance- just be aware that the dining roomis pretty outdated but still comfortable). Where else can you go for Chinese food for dinner and get a dinner special for $12 or less that includes soup and three appetizers. While we were there our waiter also brought out some little extras to try including the special of the day as well as a fresh baked macaroon. Yum!\\n\\nUpdate 9/2013 Ok, Chaina Village is still pretty cool but after trying a few more items on the menu I am less impressed by the ingredients as time goes on. Pretty sure they are using canned rather than fresh veggies and their meat is eh. Still tasty but not ideal.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Not acceptable. Our server was very attentive and seemed to understand that we were frustrated.\\n\\nFood: Debated between the crab con queso and calamari, but ultimately decided upon the crab because it was supposed to be served with \\\"homemade potato  chips.\\\" The dip was salty, and it was served with good ole $2 Santitas tortilla chips. Quite the disappointment.\\n\\nEntrees: I had the crabcakes topped with tartar sauce, served with collard greens. Crabcakes were very good and so were the greens. I just wish they wouldn't have poured the tartar sauce over my greens..not appetizing.\\n\\nMy fiance had the salmon served with spinach. His salmon was mediocre at best but the spinach was some of the best I've ever had.\\n\\nOverall, this place is overrated and I'm very glad that we used a Groupon here because I would really be upset if we paid full price.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nI love this restaurant and I probably go about once a month; however, there's just something about the inconsistency that gets me to just feel like it's not quite there.\\n\\nMad Mex offers a funky decor and typically quick service.  If you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday night, I suggest reservations because there's nowhere really to relax indoors when you are waiting for a table.\\n\\nBeing regulars, we have settled into a few choice menu items.  If you bother to read the menu, you'll notice a few jokes hidden in the description of items, so even if you are a regular, it's worth a read.  We always start with some chips and pico or the Picka Dippa and some margaritas.  The black bean dip is to die for.  Slight bit of spice, creamy black beans and a little bit of melted cheese.  The beer cheese isn't my favorite, so that one is never ordered, but we regularly switch up the salsa choices.  For margaritas, we have settled on the Ultimate margarita or the Don Julio VIP.\\n\\nThe burritos are huge.  Seriously, as big as your face type of huge.  At this restaurant, you will definitely use your silverware.  Of course, they are filled with a lot of rice and beans, so I recommend to pay extra for double meat to make a more desirable meat to starch ratio.  The chimichanga is great, but pre-made so they can't accomodate any changes.  The tacos and fajitas are good and come with nice warm flour tortillas.  Enchiladas tend to be oversauced, but overall good.  \\n\\nThe food tends to be quite consistant and you get what you expect, but other parts of the meal tend to be hit or miss:\\n1. I think it's the sour mix, but something about the margaritas tends to be really inconsistant.  Sometimes you get a strong one, sometimes not so strong.... Sometimes you get a sweet one, sometimes you get a sour one.  It's never terrible by any means, but you really never know what you are going to get.  The Greentree location has the most variation in the margaritas while McNight road's margaritas tend to be better more often.\\n2. As...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

When it came, it didn't disappoint in the spicy factor.  It did its job. Yummy. As for the chips though, those were nothing special. \\nI got two soft tacos - chicken and carnitas.

I expressed my concerns about being charged a second fee and it wasn't until other customers started to overhear our exchange did he finally agree to do the repair at no charge.  When I returned to the store a few days later to pick up my shoes, I was told by the owner how he was out $30 since he did the work for free and that I was not welcome back in his store.

We have had issues with this particular KFC location before so from now on I think we will stick to El Pollo Loco if we want chicken.  EPL tends to get the order correct.\\n\\nOne other thing: the chicken is extremely salty, like dead sea salty.  Is that a KFC trend or just this location?  I am guessing KFC in general.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

It is a combination of Velveeta, spinach enchilada filling and baja cream cheese that is nothing less than perfect. It has just the right amount of spice and is not too hot and not too mild. Just right in my opinion. I am on a budget so I cannot afford to eat there often but I go during happy hour and all 3 of the items I mentioned are 1/2 price during happy hour so I get one for eating there and I usually take home at least 2 of the spinach queso dips and eat them for the next few days. They give you a pretty large portion and a big bag of tortilla chips with each order so each appetizer is enough for me to eat 2 separate meals. It is a great deal for the money and the spinach queso warms up really well too. \\n\\nThe servers have always been really nice and taken good care of us.

        "Review: I'm so disappointed to be downgrading my Postino's experience on Yelp. I've been a regular here since I moved to the neighborhood over a year ago. However, there appears to be some staffing changes that are interfering with service.\\n\\nThe food and wine really are top of the line. There hasn't been a single morsel of food that has crossed my palate that I've disagreed with. Unfortunately the experience is not what it used to be, and for that I'm disappointed. If you're ok with extended wait time between glasses of wine, great. I'd recommend ordering a bottle of wine and being done with any further expectation of service. (Including water.)\\n\\nI've been visiting during off peak hours to ensure there would be no unnecessary wait time or standing around. (So, for example, 2pm for a lunch hour.) This is a wine bar. When you go, it would be nice to receive the wine you order. The last time we went I watched my wine sit at the bar. When my friend managed to flag down our server (fifteen minutes after we had placed our first order) what the status was he joked, \\\"I can't squeeze the grapes.\\\" (If it had been convenient/easy for me to move quickly I would have picked it up myself. Crutches, not so much.)\\n\\nSo not funny. I get it. You can get in the weeds. It's better to admit that.  But - maybe - call me crazy - check in your table more frequently the rest of the meal. We eventually were able to order a second a glass of wine. The wait time for vino was, alas, terrible.  \\n\\nI'm telling this story as an example of the service I've received as of late. There are others. I'm not sure what's happened or why. The upside to not having any table service (or much of it) is that you have ample time to speak to your table partners. Perfect for a date. Not so perfect if you're on a business lunch or in a rush at all. \\n\\nAnother option for speedier service might be to sit at the bar. The bar isn't terribly huge but offers comfortable seating. The bartenders are wonderful.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I even liked the cleverness of the name and was looking forward to a nice experience, but unfortunately I was sorely disappointed. While the view and atmosphere were very nice our service there was inexcusably poor. We ended up with a guy named Larry who was extremely inattentive, unfriendly, and all around just unprofessional. When he would finally come around he would walk away literally after two minutes WHILE we were still speaking. He was curt and abrupt in his responses and almost hit me with a knife when he dropped the silverware and did not even excuse himself or apologize. Unfortunately his brusque, rude behavior was not merely limited to our table. However, the hostesses, bussers and other waiters around us were all great, so much so we were tempted to move to another table. Maybe he was having a bad night, but for this type of establishment and for the amount of money you're laying out you would expect half-way decent service. The food was hit and miss. The Kobe short ribs were great- flavorful and tender- the tangyness of the balsamic reduction was a nice foil against the mild sweetness of the perfectly creamy polenta. Consequently, we had great expectations for our entrees- if the service was bad at least our food would be good, but alas to our dismay again we were somewhat disappointed. The central elements of our meals, the steak and halibut, were both flavorless and overdone though the supporting casts of sauces and sides were very flavorful and well prepared. The shrimp with the lemon fennel reduction was fabulous, but it could not mask the dryness and lack of flavor in the halibut. The steak was tough and flavorless and when sent back returned somewhat less tough, but still flavorless. Definitely not at all in the caliber of a Ruth's Chris, JnG, or even Fleming's or the Keg. The creme brulee was nice...\n\nStars:",

I would go back during a time when not so busy and maybe have a different experience. Overall, I've had better Greek food. Worth a try though. My rating for this place is",

        "Review text:\nChecked out this place from the groupon last night. Friday night at 750 most tables were full ONE server. ordered our food, the the wings that were small and undercooked with generic sauce. got some garlic bread that we did enjoy. we had our drinks and all 3 cups were empty with some ice and I put them at the end of the table hoping the ONE server would notice, we had to call her over for refills, she said for which ones...... (I should have said only the EMPTY ones) ALL of our dishes from the garlic bread and wings sat on the table the ENTIRE time. we ordered the White pizza and realized when we got it there was no ricotta on it. I didnt want to complain I was tired of this place. The table behind us never had their pizza put in and they sat after us, and barely got their pizza as we were talking out the door. OIL everywhere on the pizza. That should not happen with white pizza. Here is the kicker, from about 820pm (FRIDAY NIGHT) they turned away 3 groups of people because \\\"they had NOTHING left in the kitchen\\\" Really? you put out a groupon not preparing for the influx of customers?!?!??! Those people will NEVER come back when a pizza place is OUT OF FOOD at 845. such an embarressment. Will not come back again\n\nReview rating:",

        "I was expecting a complete geek-fest, I must admit. I was expecting to get harassed by medieval dorks and that sort of thing. But, I was wrong. This was thoroughly enjoyable. Buy tickets at Fry's before you go and gas up because it's quite a drive with only one city between Tucson & Apache Junction. Parking was easy. I was surprised to see actual structures making up this little town of vendors, stages & game booths. There were performers, fun and delicious food at reasonable prices and cute little shops everywhere you turned. The rides were so hilarious and ingenious. Many were powered by the riders (great for wearing the kids out) or else there were operators to hand power them and there were even elephant rides. The people visiting the fair were as diverse & delightful as the fair itself. I would love to go again and would highly recommend this fest to anyone looking to get some kicks in before the summer heat sets in! OMG-VISIT THE TOMATO THROWING INSULT BOOTH (VEGETABLE JUSTICE)!!!!

        "I would rate this ZERO, BUT DO NOT HAVE THAT CHOICE!  I had family here for an impromptu dinner and thought I would order pizza and wings for a quick, easy dinner...well it was a disaster.  I chose to order from Pizza Hut.  Well, first of all, they told me 30 minutes.  I called an hour later and they said \\\"he's on his way...just minutes\\\".  The delivery person arrived, I gave him a $3 tip on a $20 order...waaaaay too much.  I opened the pizza box to find a burned, dried out pizza that was absolutely HORRIBLE!   It was burned, cold, and dried out.  I was so embarrassed that I ordered this for family from Madison that is used to GOOD pizza.   I called to tell them about my disappointment  about the horrible product they delivered. I called back after it was delivered to tell them about my disappointment and was asked to \\\"please hold\\\".  I did not hold and after I expressed my disappointment/concern about the horrible product and service, the person hung up!  That's what I call GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  This is why eateries do NOT survive in mt. Horeb...they do not care about quality or customer service.  Good  Pubs/eateries in Mt. Horeb don't make it here...go else where - New Glarus, Verona, Madison, Spring Green...somewhere they SERVE THE PEOPLE that keep them in business. Obviously the food business in Mt. Hireb doesn't care if they stay in business...they will declare bankruptcy...the easy way out.  PIZZA HUT GO OUT OF BUSINESS...YOU SUCK.  Will NEVER ORDER FROM THERE AGAIN.

The irony, of course, is that Arizonans consider this to be perfectly passable Mexican food, but a far cry from palate-pleasing perfection. I suppose I find myself bitter knowing that such deliciousness could be viewed with such a blas\\u00e9 indifference by Phoenix's elite critics; in New York, we still seek out the one true answer to the Mexican food problem, yet in Phoenix, the answer is so abundant it produces disenchantment.\\n\\nWell, friends, we'd gladly take your La Fonda Del Sol. You get to keep the rest of those Mexican restaurants you love, so it's only a minor loss. In exchange, you may have a Rosa Mexicana and a Dos Caminos. Nay, don't thank me.\\n\\nSo, La Fonda.... Truly spicy, homemade salsa; perfectly crisp chile rellenos bathed in cheese, crusty chimichangas battered in love and ambrosia, husk-wrapped tamales that taste homemade; huge portions, incredibly low prices.

My other experiences have been fine--nothing crazy special but just what you would expect at a massage chain. I booked a same-day appointment after I woke up with a particularly painful spot. I went in about 10 minutes early to my appointment to find out that my masseuse had called in sick. They did not call me to let me know. And they could not accommodate my appointment with another masseuse. So I left my scheduled appointment with no massage. Kind of the point of going to a chain massage place is that they have a lot more staff available and are able to work like a factory line. Lesson learned for me. My rating for this place is",

It was the best experience ever.  (Second to the Double Tree in Carmel, IN.)  I walked in the lobby around 1PM and was greeted by Bobbie.  He was handling the desk by himself and I explained that we would wait in the lobby until they had a room ready (since we were 2 hours early for check in).  \\n\\nMy husband was anxious to watch the Bears game so he found a spot in the cozy waiting area with a big screen TV.  Bobbie offered to check us in early and I asked about our accommation request to be near the elevator or an area that would require very little walking.  It appeared that he may have had a challenge with our request.\\n\\nI explained the huge inconvenience with our last visit.  The lady that checked us in, sent us to one of the farthest rooms along the zig zag cooridor.  AFTER we requested a room that required very little walking (due to traveling with a family member on oxygen) and THAT was the best they could do for us?  My husband was exhausted before he was half way to the room.  Needless to say, he didn't want me to request a \\\"closer\\\" room after that.  This is why I give them my request when I book the room.\\n\\nFortunately for all of us, the extra planning helped. An extra bonus was that Bobbie ask if I was Priority Club Rewards member.  Well I wasn't, but I planned on asking...and of course it slipped my mind.  Thankfully, because Bobbie asked me about it, I am now a Priority Club member! This is great because we will be coming here a few times a year.  Bobbie was really good about explaining the details of the membership and even let me know how I can get extra points online.\\n\\nDid I say how great Bobbie was?  Well...he was everywhere!  He hand-delivered our new membership information to our room (with chocolate and a beverage). Whenever he saw me in the lobby, he always asked if there was anything I needed.

At a closer glance though, the wooden \\\"tee-pees\\\" are just ornaments that are supposed to look like Chinese roofs. We bypassed the lunch buffet in favor of dishes from the menu: chicken fried rice, pad see ew, and roast duck curry.  I also tried the Thai iced tea, which was pretty good.  It was moderately sweet, and creamy.\\n\\nI wasn't a big fan of the fried rice.  It was less greasy than your average Chinese fried rice, but it was rather salty for my taste.  The onions were way too strong (I prefer sweeter onions in fried rice).  It also was just a little more greasy than the better fried rices that I have had at other Thai restaurants.  \\n\\nThe pad see ew was good, or at least comparable to most other decent Thai restaurants in town. The one complaint I had was that the Chinese broccoli was sliced very thinly, and had the taste fried out of it.  My friend thought that the broccoli might have been a little bit off, but I didn't taste any more bitterness than average.  \\n\\nThe roast duck curry was standard, but didn't shine.  It had small chunks of duck, and was nice and soupy.  I would say that the curry here is about average as far as flavor goes, but at least it wasn't overly sweet.  The duck seemed to be prepared well.\\n\\nAlthough we didn't try it, the buffet looked decent, at least much better than the LoS buffet.  There were a wide variety of dishes available.  During lunch the place was quite busy, with dishes constantly being replaced as we ate, which is a good sign that the buffet is at least partially fresh during lunch.\\n\\nIf you are in this area, it is an OK restaurant.\n\nStars:",

This is where things took a turn for the worse, as our order was being boxed up it fell on the floor. Despite our insistence we did not want another the overcompensating manager brought it anyway.

I carried the ~40 lb box to the checkout counter. We had parked near another entrance so I left my wife to check out while I moved the car. I didn't think I'd have to ask the checkout clerk to help my wife get the box to the curb. but sure enough when I asked my wife if the clerk helped her she said no. When the checkout process was complete he turned his back to her and sat down on the counter. That is where I found him when I went back in and ripped him a new one in front of other customers. We then contacted the department manager named Veronica (the same one mentioned in another review here). Veronica was of no help and in fact her attitude made me realize the store management is the problem. They do not care if customers are helped or walk out happy. I'm not sure where they think this strategy is going but my guess is it will take Sears out of business.\n\nStars:",

This particular location on Forbes Ave is in Squirrel Hill.)\\n\\nAnd onwards!\\n\\nI worked here in Pittsburgh for a few months and had a blast.  The early morning (i.e., 5:30 AM) wasn't the most desirable, but this place has a really regular crowd with some newbies interspersed here and there.  (It isn't hard to get in with the regulars, either.)  The space at the Squirrel Hill location is a bit limited.  Weather permitting, there are two tables outside, so there's ample opportunity for people watching along this main road in Squirrel Hill--lots of folks stroll by throughout the day.  There are a handful of tables up front and then a handful more back past the coffee bar.  (The store itself is sort of shaped like a long rectangle.)  \\n\\nI was about to give the place four stars when I realized I had no cause to from a customer's perspective, and no cause to from my own, either.  I had a great time working there, but that's not what this review is about.  Let's talk about the place, shall we?  The owners and  manager(s?) LOVE coffee.  They will make (and train their employees to make) fancypants espresso drinks with very high-quality products and have really nice teas on hand, but coffee beans are their strength.  The beans are freshly roasted very frequently, and if you buy whole beans (and choose to have them remain whole or have a staff person grind 'em up), the date of the roasting will be marked on your coffee bag so you know just how fresh it is.  I'd had thousands of cups of coffee before working there and have had hundreds since:  nowhere was it fresher or was the supply better maintained.  \\n\\nThe staff is really friendly and tends to remember your order after you've been in just a handful of times.  This notion sometimes frightens me--if the coffee shop boy is remembering my order, does that  mean I need to get a life and/or go to a different joint?  NO, people.  Don't worry about it.

        "Review: Being a native east coaster, I was so excited to try this food. I had been out the entire day and hadn't had a chance to eat yet,  so my friend and I stopped in late night on New Years Eve to grab a bite. The gentleman working the counter was very personal and attentive, and the food tasted pretty good... but the entire next day I was puking and running to the bathroom. I figured, maybe I am just getting to old to eat the way I used to... but after drinking a bunch of pepto, and a few amodiums, I was still having issues. I decided after a day and a half of vomiting, and intense digestion upsets to go to our local walk in clinic. $150 dollars later, they deducted I have bacterial induced colitis... they ran some blood work on me and results are pending. Considering this was all I had eaten in the 24 hour period, it's highly unlikely it came from another source. Please review proper food handling procedures with your staff, and hand washing etiquette with your crew members, before you people kill some one. I sincerely hope that no one else gets as sick as I am right now. Antibiotics, missing two days off work, feeling miserable, and having to be stuck with needless, and $150 of doctors bills, was not worth eating at your establishment. I will not return, and will ensure I do not recommend your stores or food to anyone in the future.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

If you're looking for something that week, or the week after, you may not have a choice.  If it's not REALLY emergency but isn't something you want to wait two weeks to have checked out, you're still probably better off there than at the Urgent Care only because they have your records and a lab.\\n\\nSecond, the ladies and gentlemen in the office who check you in are incredibly nice.  I'll give them that.  Crazy helpful inasmuch as they can be.\\n\\nThe doctors seem to listen to keywords.  Lots of keywords.  And for each flagged keyword you get a test.  I LOVED how thorough they were.  And they set up a follow up appointment for a few weeks out to go over any lab results.\\n\\nSo why did I give them the Two Star \\\"Meh. I've experienced better\\\"?  If you want your lab results before that 2 week follow up, you've officially thrown a wrench into their well-oiled system.  If you need an emergency refill a week or two before an appointment, huge wrench.  If you want a referral... wrench. \\n\\nI'm not talking complicated stuff here either.  I mean they have verified they received your labs back 3 days ago and your best shot at getting anyone to read them to you in the next week and a half is to go get a copy of them and then take them to the urgent care.  \\n\\nVery well-oiled machine, but I never knew a business workflow could be modeled after the Hoffman's character in Rain Man.

Aside from all the altruistic aspects of this business being green and finding use for waste, the reason I love Stardust Building Supply is because they have saved me $1000s of dollars.   There are basically two ways this place can help you:\\n\\nFIRST:\\nIf you are tearing something down to update or replace and you need to get rid of the old stuff.  Although it still works, you know you cannot store it.....Most  tend to throw things away.   A few loads to the dump, can and does cost $100s, but you shouldn't!  Stardust will come and take half of your things and save you $100s in dump fees and you get a tax break!!!......REALLY!\\n\\nSECOND:\\nIf you are building something:\\n - a.  You need an in-home a dance studio and need a wall of mirrors, go to Stardust....pay $45 for your wall of mirrors instead of $2000.  \\n - b.  New Cabinet doors.....Stardust.\\n - c.  White Whirlpool microwave stopped working the day your warranty expired and don't want to pay $300 for a new one.  Get the exact same model a Stardust for a third.  \\n - d.  Decided you should upgrade to 6 panel interior doors when it costs you less than $300 installed because of Stardust had them on the floor.  \\n\\nStardust takes requests too!  If they don't have what you want in inventory, they will put an astrick in the computer and call you when it does come in.....YES!!!\\n\\nI have used Stardust for all of the above scenarios, these are real stories for myself over the last few years.  Stardust seems to be run by handymen, so if you need a handyman for these projects, ask, and they may be able to refer you to someone who is reputable.        \\n\\nStardust is a great resource and I am truly excited about how and what they have to offer.

        "Review: I chose this dentist because they're walking distance from our house, and I know Drs Ahn & Perez through my former place of employment.\\n\\nAs far as the whole dental experience, this place was fine, but I'm a freak of nature that loves going to the dentist so unless I walk out the door with bleeding gums, I'm gonna be content with the exam and cleaning.\\n\\nHowever, my problem with this office is that they don't take our insurance, and they neglected to inform us of this until AFTER they had already done $400+ worth of cleanings and exams on myself and my husband.  A receptionist should know which insurance policies they accept and they should be up front in telling you if yours isn't one of them.  I had my appointment and then my husband had his THREE WEEKS later.  PLENTY of time to call and say \\\"Hey, by the way, your insurance won't cover all the services since we're not one of their providers.\\\"  Seems a little shady to me.  \\n\\nSo, if they take your insurance, great!  Book it.  But be SURE they do before you let them do your exam.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I'm an oxymoron I work in cosmetics, do professional makeup and skincare, have access to all the wonderful anti aging lasers, injectibles, botox, fat melting machines, but then I hate wearing makeup, getting procedures done, and let my hair grow out without a visit to the salon that is long overdo. I'm still that little tomboy climbing trees, I guess. Low maintenance by weekday, then I bust out the fabulous by night. \\n\\nThe point being that I had let my hair go for quite awhile and the groupon just came out yesterday after I had made my much needed appointment! Already scheduled, groupon the day before my appointment, and I got a great haircut! Triple score! Plus they have pets hanging out! Quadruple SCORE! Places where you can bring a pet to work are super cool, I like the laid back implication for the business. \\n\\nHeather was my stylist and we hit it off amazingly, I gave her advice about skin treatments that would be right for her and she explained what kind of cut would be best for me. I asked about extensions because I have been curious to try them but she said the clip on ones would be better for my hair type. I appreciate that she gave me the truth straight up. I don't want my hair getting damaged after the things I have done to it! She gave me a modern chick look that I love, I can have a soft wavy romantic look, or I can straighten it and pull out the chunkiness for an edgier look. Thanks Heather, it's so easy and manageable. Prices seem pretty standard for this type of place around $45-55 per haircut. Can't wait to see what we do next!\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nSaturday, March 13,2004 1:47 a.m., Silver Saddle Saloon\\n\\nIn the back corner of the parking lot at the Silver Saddle Saloon and Dancehall on East Charleston Boulevard, 28-year-old tradesman Miguel Marcos is drinking tall cans of Budweiser and bobbing his head to mariachi music blasting from a car a few rows away. He says how much he likes the people--particularly the women--who come to the Silver Saddle, but he admits he can't remember a visit when he hasn't seen a fight.\\n\\n\\\"Man, I've seen some people take some beatings in this place,\\\" Marcos says. \\\"I saw a guy get punched so hard that his nose, like, disappeared. It was just gone.\\\"\\n\\nAt the bar's entrance, Wranglers and Stetsons mingle with jerseys and baggy pants, and a steady flow of people continues to come and go. The sidewalk leading to the entryway is splashed with vomit, and every time the doors swing open, a burst of festive music rushes outside. A white Ford F-150 pickup pulls up and stops at the front door. The truck idles for a moment before a young man runs up from behind and hurls a bottle through its rear window.\\n\\nThe window explodes like a gunshot, and bystanders (including the once-intrepid, now terror-stricken journalist) scatter for cover behind columns, trash cans and parked cars. As a half-dozen yellow-shirted bouncers pour into the parking lot, two other cars pull up and the scene flares into an old-fashioned brawl. In the middle of the fight, one of the bouncers produces a baton and smashes the driver's-side window of a red Honda Accord. More punches are thrown, Spanish curses are exchanged and after several minutes, the cars--including the white F-150--screech off into the night.\\n\\nNo one calls the police.\\n\\nA few minutes later, the only remnants of the melee are a pair of broken bottles and a small pile of safety glass. Nearby, Mia and Marcia, regulars at the Silver Saddle, lean casually against a car in the parking lot. Asked if fights are common at the bar, Mia responds, \\\"Oh, no, only like six times a...\n\nReview rating:",

That's great that you want to help 10 people at a time but again the staff can't handle that. Especially Jesus, good luck at successfully telling him you'd like a 3 item entree. *slow blinks* He's way too flustered. \\n\\nYou guys write what I want on my container so why do I constantly have to remind you for the third item like 5 times? \\n\\nThe last time I was here there was nobody else and I waited too long to get service. We were acknowledged by a staff member sweeping but....................I guess his brain wasn't sending signals to his feet that day to walk over immediately to take our order.

        "Service: I wasn't sure about LuLu's when I arrived. The hostess was impatient and raised her voice when inquiring if we wanted a table even after we have confirmed that we did. We were seated promptly and provided with utensils and waters with our orders taken pretty quickly afterwards. We waited a while for the bill which took multiple promptings, but eventually were able to pay and leave. Although it was good for a quick meal, it was not a particularly satisfying dining experience.\\n\\nFood: It was a skeptical moment to see such a wide variety of dishes at such low prices because quality becomes a factor (dishes between $6-$8). Skepticism was confirmed when the meals arrived. I ordered the Thai Curry Chicken and was not particularly impressed with the dish. It had the richness from the coconut milk, but it was a bit too sweet and the green beans tasted strange (as if old and past its freshness date). Onions were undercooked and chopped too largely that it conflicted with the texture of the dish. All in all, it was way off the mark. My brother ordered an udon dish with beef, but I was surprised to see that they added ground beef bits in it instead of slices  which to me communicated poor attention to details and choice of ingredients. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Very loud and chattery. Great for college students, large groups and families, but definitely not for a first date sort of deal or for lunch meetings (much too loud). Fake Asian decor and some aspects of the upkeep of the place were questionable (peeling wallpaper covered with plexi-glass bolted to it)\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "This is always a good restaurant and can be a great restaurant when the stars properly align which really means the service is able to cope with the crowd. We came early. We got our wine and placed our order with an attentive waiter. Food arrived in a reasonable time. Fortunately for the restaurant but unfortunately for us the place got busy. In the 45 minutes after the food we saw our waiter once. We don't expect our waiter to stand by our outside table but it would be nice to see him often enough to provide basic service such as making sure we have necessary utensils, pouring wine, making sure we have water, asking if we need anything else, getting us our check...  Lunch is expensive enough that I think customers are entitled to see wait staff regularly. The food was great, as usual: fris\\u00e9e salad, Mac and cheese, frites, steak sandwich special were great.

        "Review: Diamond Bakery, located in the Chinatown plaza, is my favorite asian bakery in town. Having lived the first half of my life in San Francisco, I didn't realize that residents were so spoiled until I moved to a place where the asian population was significantly lower. This number has increased, over the years. Note: minimum debit/charge is around $5.00.No seating inside, but there is some seating sprinkled throughout the plaza.\\n\\nThere is a huge selection of freshly baked goodies like taro rolls (my fave-so good), coconut rolls, steamed chicken buns (sio pao), macaroons, red bean filled sesame balls, egg pie, breads, hot dog buns, and assorted cakes (slice). Everything is good. Cakes are made to order and pretty reasonable. The individually wrapped goodies located on the long tables against the wall range from $0.60 to about $1.50 each! The cake is located behind the counter. I always buy a bunch of pastries when I come here. My husband really likes the coconut cake-it's moist and has the right kind of icing- not the sugary- too-sweet icing that I end up scooping off. Very small, not much ambiance, but it is clean. Helpful staff. Perfect for a light snack, dessert, or for entertaining guests at home.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

My wife and I have gone here for sandwiches, burgers and ice cream for the past 15 years and so when we wanted to grab a quick lunch after church today, we thought, lets stop in, get a bite and follow it with a quick sundae for us and the kids.\\n\\nOne good thing is that sometime since we were last there, they've opened up the floor plan and the room seems bigger. They've also added a few flat screen televisions on the walls so I was able to to keep an eye on the D-Backs game.\\n\\nHowever, I noticed initially that the prices seemed higher and my wife realized that they had just put stickers on the menus to cover the old prices and list the new ones. In general, it appears all menu items have gone up around 40%, which is a pretty steep jump.\\n\\nAs for the food, the kids had a hamburger and chicken fingers, which is hard to screw up. My wife had an El Dorado which is turkey, cheddar and bacon in the parmesan crusted bread. One of my favorites has always been the grilled cheeses sandwich which is several types of cheese on the parmesan crusted bread. I noticed today that you could order this with bacon and I thought, lets give it a try, so that is what I ordered. Unfortunately, when it came the only cheese seemed to be a slice of Velveeta with some bacon that was not even close to crispy. It was basically an overpriced croque monsieur which was not even close to what I ordered. \\n\\nAdditionally, while service was not bad, it was just kind of lackadaisical. The servers wandered by every once in a while giving the perfunctory \\\"how is everything\\\" the first few times, and generally ignoring us after that. \\n\\nBy the time we finished eating and after realizing that the classic parfaits were now $7.50 rather than the old $4.95 I was no longer even interested in ice cream. The kids had a scoop each, which I tasted and wasn't all that impressed, and then we headed out, likely not to return anytime soon.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "My husband and I go to Chipotle at least once a week for their grilled steak salad.  For us it is a satisfying meal, especially if you ask for extra lettuce.   Here's the problem with this particular Chipotle location and if it happened just once or twice, I wouldn't say anything but it is EVERY SINGLE TIME.   There are very few ingredients to manage, a few meats, a few bean choices, two rice choices, fajita, and a few toppings.  Every time we go there they are behind on keeping up with refilling their trays.  So, you get started making a salad and they are almost done and bingo - sorry, they are out of steak or sorry we are out of fajita.  Or sorry - we are out of dressing we will make some.  True they always say, no worries it's on the way, and you wait and wait while your salad gets cold and soggy.  (It's supposed to be a warm salad).  This time, they were out of fajita and they just pushed our salads aside and said the fajita would be right up.  That was odd because there was literally no one in the cooking station behind them and certainly no fajita being fried up.  When I mentioned it to the server, she looked at me sort of annoyed and went back herself to start making it.  I just said \\\"look\\\" at this point you really need to remake the salads because they are ruined.  So after she finally came out with fajita (barely cooked), she willing remade the salads.  Fine.  Now it's time to go through the salsa, sour cream, etc. section as you make your way to the cash register.   My husband said, salsa, corn and light sour cream.  So what happened?  The server put a huge ladel full of sour cream on top of his salad.   My husband said, why did you do that?  I said \\\"light\\\" sour cream.   We asked for the manager.  Trouble was, the kid that made the sour cream error was the manager!   They offered to remake our salads and we just walked out.  They don't listen, they don't stay on top of keeping their ingredients filled.  They weren't understaffed either.   It's just this location.  We went to another Chipotle in...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nIf the food does not make you sick, the customer service will!\\n\\nThis place is really a 1.5 stars for me, but I'm going to round up for these guys.  The hostess in the front desk was pretty cool, but not the rest of the staff.  Sadly that is about the only good thing I can say about this place.  Now on to the rest of the review.\\n\\nI visited this place because I was in the mood for some pho and happen noticed this place while driving by.  Dropped in and the first thing was the massive waiting line to be seated.  There were lots of people waiting outside too.  Waiting outside on a HOT summer day is not fun.  After 30 minutes of waiting, we were finally called and seated.  This is where everything started to go down hill from here.\\n\\nWe were seated and we knew what we wanted because we were looking over the menu while we were waiting, so we ordered a coconut drink, the regular pho bowl and spring rolls.  The server wrote that down on his notepad and just disappeared.  We waited for at least 30 minutes and not one single item we ordered arrive on our table.  We then started to notice people that were seated after us got their order and they were chomping away.  After about 40 minutes of wait time I was wondering how long it takes to make just a simple coconut drink.  Are they sending a monkey to climb up a coconut tree to retrieve the coconut or something?\\n\\nWe finally saw our waiter and asked him to check on our order and he returned back to us to let us know they were out of spring rolls, therefore they did not make the pho or the coconut drink.  The thing was, the server said it in a way where it was OUR fault that we ordered something they ran out of and that's why they couldn't complete our order.  I just don't understand how when they ran out of one item that is no way related to the other items on the order could prevent the entire order to be made.  It's not like it was a combo or something.  I understand if I ordered a #1 at Mc Donalds and they tell me they ran out of fries, then I would order...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

First off she did not apologize for the hour wait I had, which I expected.  No bedside manner.  Her personality is cold and she did not smile once. I left there feeling like I was wrong for asking questions.  At least the hematologist was nice. The front office has changed as well like I read in other reviews and not for the better.

        "I just went last night for the first time in a little while with a group of friends to have a good time. Little Darlings used to be my club of choice for about 4 years. I used to go all the time because the atmosphere was great, the girls were very pretty, and I always had a good time there. I've spent a LOT of money there in the past.\\n\\nThey must have gone under new management recently because that was certainly not the case last night. We rolled up two cars deep. I drove the first car, and as soon as we got to the parking lot we were approached by security, who would not let us get a word in about waiting for our friends who were right behind us. He told us to get in the club or leave. We brushed it off and went into the club. We stood in line waiting for our friends. Another security approached my buddy and demanded that he take off his beanie. I understand its club policy, but he certainly didn't have to be rude about it.\\n\\nBy that point our friends still hadn't showed up, so we decided to step out and walk across the street to the empty parking lot to wait. When the rest of our party arrived we went back in and got back in line. The same security that gave my buddy attitude about his beanie was very pushy and rude getting everyone up against the wall so we could be funneled through the metal detector, which is a also a new inconvenience.\\n\\nBy now i'd had about enough of their attitude before we even got in the club so we turned around and walked out again. We were a decent sized group that brought several hundred dollars with us to spend that night but Little D's worked hard to lose our business. I'm sure the atmosphere inside the club is still decent if you can work through the attitude they give you at the door. They may have lost my business indefinitely.\\n\\nWe had a good time at Sheri's Cabaret later that night. My rating for this place is",

Went here today with a friend to get rid of a pho craving that ive been having for a week. \\n\\nInterior: The dining area was dirty, and a bee was flying around our table so we switched spots. The saucers had crusty sauces on then and the tables were sticky. Tables were sticky. \\n\\nFood: i got the #10 combo pho. It was decent. The broth wasnt as tasty as id like, and the temperature wasnt as hot either. Id rate the pho 7/10. Ill give them credit for being the fastest pho preparers though. My pho came out in 1 min. Even faster then the side plate with mint, bean sprouts etc. \\n\\nService: it was very fast and prompt. Server came out with water as soon as were seated. He was pretty friendly as well.\\n\\nOverall it was decent. I wont be back however.

        "Blindly went to Taylor's with a friend on Sunday (had I known where we were going I would have recommended someplace else). I decided to be open minded and give them another try. I ordered an iced tea and the waffle, he got the poached eggs with hollandaise and a coffee. The server took our orders and returned with an OJ for me, forgivable offense - she took it away and brought me back a an iced tea. \\n\\nThen the incredible wait began... An hour later we finally flagged someone down to inquire on our food. He said he would check for us.. We never saw him again. There was a party of 3 and a party of 6 next to us, they both ordered after us and were almost done with their meal... Both parties were complaining about missing items, I overheard a bagel, a side of fruit and a waitress had all disappeared. At this point I was ravenous and we again went to find our server.. She finally brought our food, and it was horrible. The waffle was dry and tasteless and the poached eggs were drenched in hollandaise, thick greasy hollandaise that looked and tasted like it had been sitting on the plate for ages. \\n\\nOur horrible breakfast experience lasted 1:40 minutes. Ridiculous. I will not be returning, 3 strikes Taylor's you're out. I left a Yelp card on the table, hopefully they read this an make some improvements.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "There are some people who play magic the gathering (and similar games) who also maintain normal social lives, have girlfriends, and even shower regularly. You won't find any of this type of player among the staff of this shop. \\n\\nIt's hard for new players to get started in magic because there is a stigma about MTG players being rude, unfriendly, not sociable, and generally smelly. Such is my experience from the staff at the shop. And no wonder people don't want to try playing this game.\\n\\nSo let me tell you my story. I've played magic for a long long time (since around urza's saga), but just recently decided to get back into it heavily. A friend of mine and I went to this store to pick up some boosters and whatever, and just check it out because we've heard good things. He is also a brand new player.\\n\\nI think because I was wearing a collared shirt and was freshly shaven, the staff considered me some kind of menace or outsider, and avoided eye contact, no matter how long I stood at the counter ready to buy something, until I finally asked someone directly to help ring me up. I felt like a guy in a ski mask trying to buy cigarettes.\\n\\nWe came on a thursday, which was draft night, a format my friend and I were not familiar with at the time. HO-BOY was I sorry I asked for information about how draft works. It was such an effort for the guy at the counter (I think he was the owner) to explain it to me. Like I was asking him to do my taxes. He and his unwashed friends or employees (I couldn't tell who actually worked there) also made a couple snarky comments and giggled at my ignorance. \\n\\nSo how the shit are people supposed to learn to play? Don't these people want new opponents? Why must they try and alienate new players? Please, I would like to know.\\n\\nIf you work here, keep this in mind. There are people like me who, unlike you, haven't entirely given up on the opposite sex. That doesn't mean I'm not just as much of a nerd on the inside. Just like you, I'm going to go home after this and play 6-8 hours...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "We went here on a Wednesday evening to have dinner with some friends for a birthday.  I was told that they have \\\"the best food in town\\\".  You have to remember that this town is very small and riddled with fast food and a few chain restaurants, so there is not much in the way of competition.  I was also told that they serve \\\"authentic Mexican\\\" food.  I had the ground beef chimichanga which comes with beans and rice, sour cream and guacamole.  My wife had the Carne Asada which came with beans and rice and tortillas.  The chimi that I had was very good.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The Carne Asada, on the other hand, was something other than good.  It had a very weird flavor that I could not pinpoint and was very tough.  We also ordered the cheese sauce on the side to use as a dip with the chips and salsa (the salsa was very good and had just the right amount of heat).  The cheese sauce was, to put it plainly, gross.  It tasted like it had mustard in it, a very tangy and almost vinegar-like after taste.  It was just plain nasty.  The service was extremely slow and refills were hard to come by.  The place itself was dirty, stained ceiling tiles and stains on the walls, the restrooms are in need of an extreme makeover and I am not sure if the air conditioning was off or just set really high, but when you are sweating just sitting there and it is 113 out, something is wrong.  I just don't think that we will go back.  Oh, I almost forgot, we ordered a side of pickled jalapenos to eat with our dinner.  They were very dry and almost tasteless and no heat what so ever, they could have been pickled green peppers for all I know.  BTW no alcohol at all.  Not a deal breaker but I thought you might want to know!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nO.K.  So my first experience with Ulta was ok.  I went in with a coupon that I got in their weeky mailing for a discount on their hair service.  I got some accent highlight on my long, brunette hair for the holidays.  I asked for small shimmery highlights and got what I asked for.  Happy.  Price was good, job was done right.  Next visit was for root retouch to keep the highlights for another season, this time was different.  I got a different person, because my previous girl had quit.  The lady was friendly and had a touching story, but her highlights were heavier than I'd asked for, and now they're sort of ghetto looking, to the point where I dont want to flat iron my wavy hair in fright that they are going to look like streamers hanging from the top of my head.  Ugh.  Im going to wear them as best as I can for now and then cover them up with dark color, done at a different salon for sure, then take another 5 years to regrow my hair sans any artificial hair color.  Also I was quoted $120 and walked out pissed that I dished out $170 for some linguini highlights when I asked for angel hair or thinner accents.  \\nOne plus...I took my younger 14 year old sister with me, and I figured she should take her DS or a book to entertain herself while I was being done up.  They had an Exuviance brand facial session that was free so I signer her up against her will, the poor soul, but she ended up spending the two hours with the ladies, and walked out with a series of freebies and about $65 in product purchases, and a glowy face!  She was a happy camper and that helped me deal with the frustration of overpaying for my services.  \\nI suppose I recommend this for someone who is visiting to purchase hair products, just not services.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "So I gave Portland's another shot this past weekend, given their $30 summer prix fixe menu and its proximity to my new place.  Like Melissa H said there was a change in the pf menu and the fish I was going to get was replaced with duck, to which I am allergic.  So the pf menu was out.\\n\\nI agree with everything she said about the appetizers.  I ordered the Cajun shrimp pasta for my entree and I was less than impressed.  The pasta was incredibly overcooked, it was literally falling apart on my fork.  The shrimp were large and plentiful so I just ended up eating all the shrimp and leaving the shreds of pasta behind.  \\n\\nThe strangest part of the meal, for me, was when my entree was brought to the table.  I was informed that they did not have any knives. (!) but \\\"I did bring you a fork\\\"....wow, that is so nice of you!  I was just planning on using my hands to eat the pasta but you thought so much to bring me a fork!  I looked around at all the empty tables around us that had place settings and wondered why they could not have given me one of those place settings which had knives.  (Seriously, by that point we were one of two parties in the restaurant).  I was then left with a choice of a. shoving a whole shrimp into my mouth, b. eating the shrimp off the fork in a klassy corn dog type of fashion or c. cutting the shrimp with my fork.  (I opted for c. and it was pretty difficult to do...)  \\n\\nMy conclusion on Portland's is that the food is consistently mediocre (sometimes even below mediocre) and it functions best as a place to have a drink.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

It looked decent at the finish, but started to chip the within the next two days, so I wasn't bowled over and had no intention of going back.  I recently left work late and didn't have time to drive to my usual place, so I decided to give this one another shot.  I asked if they had time to do a manicure only.  The nail tech said that he did and he would be right with me.  I waited about 15 minutes.  Another person (likely a regular, judging by the level of familiarity with the tech) walks in and asks if he has time to take her.  He says he does and he'll be with her in a bit.  She sits down, then gets up in a few minutes and walks off to the back of the salon.  I go back to reading my Glamour and finish the magazine.  Which was apparently awesome because the next thing I know, I've been sitting there for over an hour and the person that came in after me, is sitting at a station, being worked on by the nail tech that was going to \\\"be right with me\\\".  I wordlessly got up, left and have never been back. My rating for this place is",

        "Review: Went here on a pretty snowy night from Milwaukee with the future in-laws.  We didn't have great directions, but after texting GOOGL and getting the number, they gave very simple (and accurate) directions.\\n\\nWe sit down, and there is kinda a lake view except for the snow and the dark.  It cleared up later so we could see some distant lights and that was nice.  The dessert menu is out at the beginning, because if you want Bananas Foster or Cherries Jubilee or Pches Louis or other flambed dessert you need to order it at the beginning of the meal.  They all looked like they had vegan potential (minus the ice cream, and in the Bananas Foster, butter as well), but the kind waiter said that they would be too concentrated with just the sauce.  Oh well.\\n\\nThe food here is French, but this being Madison they did have one vegetarian item on the menu (pasta with a creme sauce).  They made it vegan with coconut milk for us and it was pretty good.\\n\\nThe service was pretty good, atleast from the main server.  The other attendants seemed to mix things up a bit sometimes.  It was a slow meal, but that is how they do things here intentionally.\\n\\nSo, high marks for service and for trying for veg, and for the show of making the food, but I didn't really leave too satisfied, so low marks for that.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The grain of rice they used didn't go well with the meal and the beans were overcooked\\n\\n\\nPros\\nService - was fantastic. Our server didn't miss a beat handling our demanding party of 15. Thank you! Also, hostess was very friendly and kept us up to the minutes with updates on our table being ready.\\n\\nThat being said, I would not be returning. Food just wasn't good.\n\nReview rating:",

Gotta represent the home team. \\n\\nIt is small. The people who ring you out aren't that interested in helping you. But everybody else that works here in the past three weeks that I've been stopping in have been really helpful and insightful on what I should read next. \\n\\nThere are enough tables to do homework. Granted, there aren't a lot, but there are enough. If you can't find a place around the front, nobody sits at the tables towards the back. I must have been in an awful mood the last time I was in. I remember the day vaguely and remember spending a lot of time on the phone with customer service people at AT&T. That must have been why. Me + rude customer service agents = direct Yelp impact. Good thing for updates. \\n\\nStill, there's one thing that sucks about this library, and all Phoenix libraries; a lack of good newspaper. Honestly, the Arizona Republic is an awful newspaper. It absorbs nearly every article from Reuters. There's no originality. So, yeah I realize you guys have to carry it, but carry something else too. If I spoke Spanish I'd take advantage of the Spanish newspaper, but alas, I do not. The LA times and New York Times are grand, but where's the Chicago Sun Times, the SF Chronicle, or La Monde? I like newspaper. You guys need more. \\n\\nEither way, I spend a lot of time here struggling over Calc homework. I've grown to love it.\n\nStars:",

        "NOT Recommended! I have ordered Tandoori chicken all over the world.  I never had green Tandoori chicken. I asked the waiter of the order was mixed up and he said no. They do not use artificial color. I gave it a shot. Horrible! Real Tandoori uses cayenne, turmeric, paprika and Masala for the red color. Then baked in a tandoor oven. I recommend they hire a real chef from India. \\n\\nI read so many rave reviews about the garlic naan bread. The worst naan in my life. Burnt, thin and taste of only garlic. \\n\\nIf anyone knows a great Indian restaurant, please tell me or invite me over for mom's cooking.\nSo I would like to give it",

The food quality has been steadily going down hill. The wings and portions are getting smaller and more expensive. The quality of the wings rates to barely edible. \\n\\nThis place needs to get another food vendor, because the quality is horrible. Then retrain the staff to get the order right. The last time I went there, the food was overcooked to the point the meat was dehydrated, greasy, and made my stomach sore for a few days. \\n\\nThe ambiance, and the staff are great.

        "We went to get lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. Waited for about 15-20 minutes for a table. VERY cramped waiting area. \\n\\nMenu had a lot of options. I went with the \\\"Monkey Stuff\\\" sandwich - this sweet, delectable sandwich of tasty sugary goodness. This sandwich would have been way better had the bread been toasted. By the end I just felt like I was eating a mush of sugar. To counteract this sugar, I also ordered from the salad bar. I liked the layout of the Salad Bar - you pay $0.38 per oz of salad you get, so I had a filling salad to go with my sweet sandwich for only $2.50! Not a very diverse salad bar, but I was fairly pleased.\\n\\nThe other members of my party enjoyed their meal just fine, but we didn't feel this was anything special. The decor of the restaurant is very vintage, so it ;s kind of dark and has a different feel to it. After reading the reviews, I'm bummed I didn't order a milkshake! I don't know that we'd necessarily make a special trip to come back here.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I wouldn't say I hated this place more on the side of I expected more from a place so hyped. Obviously this place is over hyped. \\n\\nJapanese Dishes: 3/5 I ordered a Gyu don (beef bowl $5.50) I love Japanese beef bowls with a side of Mapo Tofu (spicy tofu $4.15). I wasn't too impressed by their recipe. Most mapo Tofu's I've tried are spicy and the sauce is a bit thick but at ichiza I felt it was really bland and soupy. The Gyu don tasted like a beef bowl, not a Japanese beef bowl it didn't taste authentic, I also felt like something was missing. The portions were also pretty small. \\n\\nSushi: 4/5 After reading a few reviews I thought I'd try the deep fried California roll. I'm not much of a roll person or a deep fried person and California rolls aren't even sushi. BUT it was actually pretty good, I also ordered the Dragon roll which was OVER SAUCED. Its suppose to be eel,cucumbers, and avocado drizzled with eel sauce for a bit of color and flavor, but I think they went sauce happy on my roll. \\n\\nAlcohol: 5/5 The famous sake bombs at Ichiza, I suggest don't come here if its a date or a small group. Ichiza is known for big groups of drunks at their low tables slamming on the table doing sake bombs all night long!\\n\\nSeating: 4/5 I like Ichiza's Japanese style ambiance. You can get seated around the bar (which doesn't give you much elbow room next to the person beside you) or at their tables. I love their low Japanese tables its something you have to try at least once. \\n\\nWait: 3/5 The wait here can be pretty long up to 45 min depending on the time and day you you. On the weekends I know this place gets pretty busy and it's small so seating is limited. Expect a wait.\n\nStars:",

        "Review: I was in Vegas recently on business at a trade show. Saw some buddies that I used to interface and partner with, and so we decided to go out and eat and catch up. \\n\\nLet's see, you are in Las Vegas, on business, and of all the choices, where would you want to go? Since their company is very cheap, they have a very small expense allowance. And since their company definitely has a macho-like personality, sort of a frat brothers, locker room personna, they chose Hooters!\\n\\nI said \\\"Are you kidding me?\\\" I suggested going to Chinatown and getting some good, inexpensive food, like Thai, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, and I had a car to take them all out there. But since it was 3 of them versus just me, it was Hooters.\\n\\nHooters Hotel and Casino is exactly like their restaurants. Girls in white Tees and little orange gym shorts. You would think that here in Vegas, this would be their flagship location and they would upscale it in decor, amenities, and staffing. \\n\\nNope. \\n\\nEven though it is a hotel and Casino, it has the same look and feel of their restaurants. What do they call themselves? Tacky? They got that right.\\n\\nPlus, Hooters has awful food. Deep fried, tasteless, unimaginative. It's food you might find in Talledega at the NASCAR races in the picnic coolers of the baseball cap wearing HVAC and Cable repair men. Only warmed up a bit. \\n\\nIn Vegas, with all the beautiful women working here in the various service venues of shows, casinos, gentelmen's clubs, etc., Hooters has got to be the bottom of the barrel. The \\\"talent\\\" here is just above 7 Eleven, just wearing less. That makes the food that much more indigestible.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Great little sushi bar that seats about 20 including the bar that sits about 6, which is why I rated this a 4 because of small space, other than that, the food was amazing. \\n\\nAtmosphere was cute, decorated with traditional Japanese decor like in Japan, felt comfy. Waitress was really nice and friendly and took our order right away, never asked\\nFor anything, all refills kept on coming along with napkins. Hubby and I got the all you can eat which was $23 dinner, and for lunch I believe it's $19, by far the cheapest sushi bar I've been to! \\n\\nAll you can eat menu had a large variety of different kind of sushi, including specialty sushi, baked sushi and deep fried. My absolute favorite was the \\\"Sushi Bay\\\" roll. It's a must to try that. Also the \\\"Super White Tuna\\\" so fresh and creamy. \\n\\nI will most definitely come back for more.

        "There's two kinds of workday restaurant lunches in my life. The first kind occurs about once a week, when everyone on the team goes, and we spend some time socializing in a real restaurant. The other kind also occurs about once a week and involves my walking out the door without my (fully packed, waiting in the fridge) lunch bag.  Jason's is a good spot for the latter type of lunch, but not the former.  The food is good and, depending on what you get, even fairly healthy.  I tend to stick to the \\\"lighter choice\\\" sandwiches, which include things like chicken salad and the Mediterranean wrap.  The salad bar is extensive and fresh.\\n\\nThe reason Jason's is not good for the more social kind of work lunch is that it's big, crowded, pretty atmosphere-less, and loud.

        "Wow, I have never received worse customer service than here.  Set up a tee time for a saturday morning round of gold with some buddies from college.  It had rained all week and was raining the morning of our reservation and was about 40 degrees at 6 am.  I wore a collared shirt and blue jeans due to the cold.  Mind you, I understand the need for a dress code at nice golf courses to keep the riff raff out.  My jeans were presentable, my shirt was a nice polo, and NOWHERE on the website does it state no denim, only the need for a collared shirt. When I arrived, I met Mike, who is the cashier at the clubhouse.  From the second I walked in the door, Mike started harrasing me about my jeans, telling me I could not play yet would still have to pay because of the 24 hour cancellation policy.  Mike was extremely rude and unwilling to have a rational discussion about the \\\"unposted\\\"dress policy. 10 fays later, they charged my credit card I had used to reserve the time for $240 which I disputed.  I, for one, will never golf here again although I have played at Johnson Ranch several times while in school.  The course is average.  First nine holes can be found anywhere for less money, back nine is nice although all the building of houses has diminished its appeal. If you value any type of customer service for your hard earned money, look elsewhere.  Superstition Springs is much nicer for the price in my opinion. My rating for this place is",

        "It's close to my neighborhood, hence the 2 star. \\nbut seriously, it's like Walmart stuff at Whole Food's price. for the same item, it charges substantially higher (~40%+) than Target -which is not even known for cheap grocery.  \\nI still go there because it's close, and I go for specific items on sale so it's not bad. But overall the store is way too pricy - for no good reason! which is probably the reason it gets on my nerve the most! over the years I've frequented many pricy groceries: Andronico's (CA), Morton Williams (NY), Wegman (MD), and Whole Foods everywhere - and these stores all had one common quality: they carry nice stuff! When I want to cook pretentious gourmet food, they have every ingredient ready. I don't expect every store to be cheap and carry good stuff like Trader Joe's, ergo I was never the one to oppose stores just because they're pricy. But this one is just pricy unjustifiably. You can over charge me on truffle oil and duck confit, but I'm not happy to be charged double on corn syrup and canola oil. Same brand, same item, nearly double the price. even the CVS downtown don't overcharge as much so don't say this is for the location.

        "Review: Extremely disappointed.    My wife and I walked into the restaurant to have the hostess tell us that is was open seating.   Okay, that's fine..... as we walk to find our table I'm wondering 'why don't the just have a sign there because she wasn't  very friendly, nor timely with the direction.'    That said, we sat down at a table set up for dining that was nicely presented.   Unfortunately we sat at the table for approximately five minutes without recognition from any employee at the restaurant.   At this point, we decided to dine elsewhere.   As we walked out, there was still not one bit of attention given, again.   The hostess never lifted her head from whatever she was reading.   I think that a sign would have served a much better purpose.   On the back side it could have said \\\"thanks for your business\\\" .....or lack, there of.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

We know to plan a couple of hours for dining at the Melting Pot...and that is one of the reasons we love it but 3 hours was a bit long. \\n\\nI could even live with the three hours but what really got me in the end was the dessert...which if you read the reviews is what they are known for.  After much debate we ordered the Turtle fondue.  After placing the chocolate/caramel  mixture on our table I asked about the pecans...which I was then informed by the server...oh we're out of pecans!  REALLY...that would have been good information when we ordered the Turtle fondue.  Then she charged us $2.00 extra for another cheesecake.  Maybe you should have went ahead and gave us the extra cheesecake since you were out of pecans for our TURTLE chocolate fondue. \\n\\nIt wasn't our first rodeo at this establishment.

        "After a year and a half of living in the Valley, I finally made it to US Airways twice in March - once for the Cavs/Suns game and once for the Elton John/Billy Joel Face to Face concert. For the Suns game, I went with two girlfriends and we drove...parking was super easy and convenient in a garage and it was only $10. Sweet. For the concert, my husband and I took light rail and it ran late that evening. Double sweet. Walking around downtown around 5:45 pm the evening of the concert, parking near US Airways was running about $20-25.\\n\\nThe atmosphere outside before the Suns game was awesome - live band playing and different things set up for kids and kids at heart alike. Getting in for the game was really easy and quick; for the concert, not so much. It was a huge clusterf*ck and while at times there was semblences of lines, really it was just people pushing toward the door. Once inside, both times, I really wished there was better signage and directions on which way to head. I have been to better looking arenas, but the worst part about the setup for US Airways is that the walkways, especially on the second level, are quite narrow for the amount of people that were at both events, so it gets way too congested to even walk.\\n\\nThe concession stand choices are horrid. My two girlfriends and I set out to find something to eat prior to the Suns game beginning and we finally had to settle for Subway. The concession stand choices that we saw were pizza, nachos, pretzels, and candy. No fries. No burgers. No chicken tenders. Definitely make sure to eat at one of the restaurants around the arena before heading in. \\n\\nFor the Suns game, we sat in section 225 which is a corner section. For buying the tickets two days prior to the game for $53 each, we were really happy with our seats and the view. We didn't miss any of the action and even from section 225, row 10, Shaq looked HUGE. We didn't feel too far away at all and we had perfect views of the court and the scoreboards. For the concert, we were in section 219 which...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: My husband and I, and our two children, love K O'Donnell's Bar and Grill.  Even though \\\"bar\\\" is part of the name, K O'Donnell's is great for families.  If you enjoy sports, this is the place to be... HD TV's everywhere, including in the dining area, but the volume is not overly loud.  The food is wonderful... you can't find a better burger in town for $8.50 (comes with a side, such as salad, fries, or onion rings - which are made perfectly and are delicious).  Our son always orders a slice of pepperoni pizza... it's huge... and only $2.  I've had the Teriyaki Chicken sandwich, which is also a great choice... tender chicken breast marinated in a tangy teriyaki sauce, a thick slice of grilled fresh pineapple, served on a toasted roll... with a side, for $8.50.  The service is awesome; soft drinks are refilled without asking.   The owner has personally greeted us at our table on multiple visits.  The servers pay special attention to kids.   When my son won a Little League championship game last year, and we stopped at K O'Donnell's to celebrate, the staff brought out a complimentary \\\"make-your-own\\\" ice cream sundae, with several small dishes of toppings such as M&M's, sprinkles, chocolate syrup, etc.   My son was thrilled and, needless to say, we keep coming back, knowing that the staff will take care of us.  They just expanded an inviting outdoor patio and we hear that they host live entertainment on Friday and Saturday nights.   I can't say enough about this place... come check it out for yourself, you won't be disappointed.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The owner makes them himself fresh, and order from them... they sell 62 pieces for $30. thats a deal! We tend to order from here whenever we have to go to potlucks or we need to cater an event. \\n\\nTheir cooking is fresh when you order from them, otherwise if you base it off the food they have displayed... it looks dried and old... but surprisingly when you get catering from them... they are hella generous, always give a little more, like free donuts. and when I order tray of lo mein from them... they don't just fill it to the rim... they fill past the rim and pile and pile the noodles in the tray and it's the foil that keeps from spilling out!!! they ain't stingy with servings here. \\n\\nThey have awesome fried cream cheese wontons... and they're cheap!!! 12pieces for $6.95 you can't beat that price, coz you order from Rice N Noodle (not to bash on them) but you get 4 pieces for $5 something I think... just saying. \\n\\nHonestly I would give this place a 1 or 2 star just based on the place and display of the place... but they really are a \\\"Rice To-Go\\\" establishment... order your shit TO-GO or by the trays so your food is bomb bomb and fresh!! and you'll save money than ordering anywhere else. So rightfully I have to give 3 stars for awesome affordable cheap pricing, good food when you order, and for the best LARGE shumai in town!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

What I could understand was that he wouldn't repair my purse-said it was unfixable. I have a white leather purse that got some blue ink on the outside; a simple fix accomplished by re-dying it white. He wouldn't do it. So I went to the Shoe Shop at 39th St. And Camelback. He fixed it in 3 days.

The first person at our table didn't say a word while he poured our water. The server showed up several minutes later, but dismissed our questions quickly refocusing us to explain a menu item that was unavailable and it's alternate. Starters took a while. The mussel app was good until the 5th which was so fishy and rank I had to spit it out (so it was my last). After another 45 minutes, 3 of 4 entrees arrived. After a wait and finally asking the hostess to track down our last entree, it finally was delivered. My salmon and shrimp (the special/alternate) were overcooked but pasta underneath was good. Lasagna had been sitting so long under a heat lamp that a few layers were too hard to eat, meatloaf was ok. Lamb chops were good, but cold by the time meatloaf arrived and we could all start to eat.

        "Review text:\nI hate assigned seats at a concert venue. Especially in today's internet purchasing age where all you can do is pray to the music Gods that you are going to get a good seat. You sit patiently in front of your seat, constantly reloading a page as the internet sale begins to make sure you are right there when it starts. You request seats in what must be 10 seconds after the sale started, and the best seats you can get are in the 26th row off center. WTF do you have to do to get a set of the primo seats just fucking once?\\n\\nThe consolation for seated venues is that it is usually in a great outdoor amphiteater where you can kick back and enjoy your reserved space under the stars. Or its in an art-deco revival theater that is an amazing setting for a show. \\n\\nBut here at Dodge, there is no consolation prize. Its boxy, boring, and cold. They went to no expense whatsoever to dress up the Dodge or make it an interesting place to see a concert. Its gray, drab, and would totally put you to sleep if it didn't have an amazing soundsystem powered by some top notch acts that play here.\\n\\nIn addition, it has some seating that in no way, shape, or form should be sold at full price. The seats at the far left and right sections of the main area should be avoided at all costs. They are commonly as much as any other seat in the house, but are at such a sharp viewing angle that you can only see the front of the stage. I saw a Cure concert from there recently and never was able to confirm if they in fact had a drummer in the band.\\n\\nAnd to top it off you are likely going to have to pay hefty ticket prices at about 50-100 dollars, have about 15 dollars in fees per ticket, and have to pay 10 dollars for low quality brews.\\n\\nTo enjoy this place you need to REALLY want to see whoever plays here, have some good friends with you, drink heavily before the show, stay away from the seats at the far sides, show up just in time for the show, and be ready to indulge in the intense sound this place produces because there is nothing else...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I would have thought they would have it on file on their computers, but they dint.  I ended up paying full price for the replacement tire for reasons they couldn't really explain to me and I just got tired of arguing and paid it and left.  I just recently replaced the whole set after only 8 months of wear, but this time I went to another store and bought their cheapest tires without warranty because even if they dint wear as well I can still afford to just replace them and have new tires more often.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I got the stir-fry veggies and squash casserole for sides and they were tasty as well, although I was expecting something more home made feeling with the casserole. The corn bread was okay, I prefer the square to the muffin types. The soda (Cherry Coke) machine tasted like it needed a calibration, too syrupy.

        "Review text:\nI really, really, REALLY wanted to give this place a chance because it holds sentimental value, but I was let down in a big way.\\n\\nYou walk in to OSF and you're immediately overcome with that \\\"old-timey\\\" stench. The same stench that can be found in thrift stores and your grandmother's moth-balled attic. Albeit, the building has been around for decades, it doesn't need to smell like it. \\n\\nThe service was decent, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the food was less than spectacular. The salad that preludes the meal was drenched in dressing, but the bread came out fresh and still very warm. We ordered the lasagna with marinara sauce and manicotti with meat sauce. The noodles were cooked perfectly and that's where the praise stops. The filling hardly filled either entree and the sauces tasted as if they were poured from Chef Boyardee cans. Absolutely hated the meal. Thank goodness for free refills on the soft drinks, because it took a lot to wash that taste from the taste buds. \\n\\nNot sure if we'll ever be back to this location. We might give the one in Chandler a chance, but only time will tell.\n\nReview rating:",

I made a reservation ahead of time online through OneStopParking for parking at Sundance. The woman said they had no record of my reservation - after she asked for my name several times which is an easy name, nonetheless, she could have just asked me for my ID instead of asking for my name almost 5 times. Then she asked me to email her my reservation which I did and she kept asking me what my rate was. I had a receipt that said I would owe $32 total for my parking fee. Plus side is the shuttle drivers know what they are doing and are very convenient. When I checked out, they said I owed $42 which is $10 more than the prepaid parking I had arranged = and no, I did not use any additional time = my flights were on time and I actually had my car parked there less time than I had booked for myself at the $32 rate. Very disappointed with this company, I hope they either get their act together or go out of business. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS when I asked them to refund my $10. Thanks a ton stupid parking Nazis.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "I would NOT reccommend this dealership to anyone. I purchased a brand new 2011 VW Jetta last NOvember from Findlay VW. 2 weeks after i purchased the car, the tire blew out and no one could figure out what the cause was. At first they were going to make me pay full prices for the tire even though i only had the car barely 2 weeks. After arguing with them and going back and forth, they finally split the cost with me. The sales person I purchased it from, during the whole ordeal would not call me back after leaving several messages. Now, i have something else wrong with it. I will NEVER take my car back there for anything. I go to Desert where they have much better customer service. The customer service at Findlay Volkswagen is horrible. After they got their money and my trade in, they didnt care about me afterwards. I would never recommend them to anyone or go back to them for anything. Maybe theres a reason why my car was the last 2011 on the lot and they just wanted to get rid of it.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Their sliders (I've had them on four different occasions) are awesome.  Three pool tables, typical sports bar, but with a friendly, eclectic clientele.  Staff are friendly, although a little slow with table service from time to time.  Very open-minded and I've always had a ball in the place, no matter what I'm wearing.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

We came on a Sunday morning and upon arrival the parking lot was packed, and so was the inside, but we were seated right away. (Only a party of 2). The atmosphere was warm and homey, we sat in a corner booth. Our waiter was very nice and gave us plenty of time to order. We ordered the Denver omelet that comes with hash browns and subbed pancakes for the toast. It was wonderful! All the food was hot when we got it, the hash browns were REAL potatoes, sliced very thin. The omelet was huge, definitely big enough to split, and the pancakes were fluffy and delicious; even the syrup was warm! If I lived in Phoenix I would definitely come back here!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

There was no rules posted regarding this would be an issue. She was quoted a reasonable rate, and we left DC to come to Charlotte to see our daughter for Family weekend at college. \\n\\nWe arrived, and went in to be greeted by Bina. We also had a coupon we found at local rest stop magazine. She first explained coupon would not be honored as we went through Priceline, so we asked if we could just cancel reservation and start over. She explained that was not a part of THEIR policy, and would still be charged full rate, so we said screw it, gave coupon to another nice couple and went forward with transaction explaining we were just paying cash. We were then given a much larger rate, and when they learned that it was my mothers card they demanded she be there or she would still be charged as well.\\n\\n(This is what appears on their website: You must show a valid photo ID and credit card upon check-in. Please note that all special requests cannot be guaranteed and are subject to availability upon check-in. Additional charges may apply.\\nGuests are required to show a photo ID and credit card upon check-in.

I did get a kick out of it.\\n\\nTo cut a long story short, the service sucked and the foods was American. Obviously we only had a small selection to base on... forgot to try the sweet bread.\\n\\nI had the BBQ grill with 3 kinds of steaks... Fillet Mignon, skirt, and flat. It's all tasted good, with American flavor. Can't tell what's so special about the taste. The meats were slightly overdone... in most cuts here. And the portable hot grill plate (where the meat was served on the table) kept them cooking even further. For the price, there was no side dishes... but you certainly can order a la carte... French fries $3.95 and mixed salad $4.95.\\n\\nMy friend order Fillet Mignon. He loved it. It was missing some cooked vegetables on the plate but he didn't complain. It came with a medium size mixed dinner salad (I thought medium size fries was included... we did not order it but it was brought to the table and we got charge for it) for $17.95. It was harder to swallow under the circumstance.\\n\\nIt came with free breads and strong garlic olive oil for dipping. I used it on the salad too. Not bad. The Argentinian tea (in a tea bag) was interesting and not bad, but not much different than regular herbal tea on my not-so-subtle tongue.\\n\\nA boxing game (Khan and Maidona) was being streamed live from Mandalay bay. It was not very crowded. Our server was very friendly but communication was not the best. And worse, she was watching the game more than attending to our needs. The bus boy did a better job to get us hot water to refill tea, and bread basket.\\n\\nMy friend loved the food experience overall. It's OK for me.\\n\\nSo diners, enjoy some American dishes (the other was mainly Americanized Italian). Service can be spotty. Make sure you double check your order for extra foods and unexpected charges.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "This place(not the one in Tempe or Chandler) is my favorite place to eat out of any option. I seriously don't think they know how damned great their food it. If they were to move to a new building and modernize the decor they could charge me twice the amount and I wouldn't even flinch. We go pretty much every Friday and hover around 5pm for them to open like stalkers outside some window. Over the 4 years I have been going to this place I have been able to try various dishes and here is my rating on each dish and overall dining experience.\\n\\nAmbiance: 3/5 The place doesn't have the right flow if you were to visit you would see what I mean. The takeout area is in the middle and the wait to be seated area is around 6 feet from the door and I imagine some people might not be seated due to them not being noticed. The decor isn't much of a date place if you were trying to have the whole package of aesthetics and good food so don't come in thinking it's a Ticoz or Tuck Shop.\\n\\nService: 5/5 The best I have ever had, each person is lightning quick they are super friendly and the food comes out so fast it will make your head spin sometimes.\\n\\nFood:  I don't know how to articulate how great it is.\\n\\n72- 5/5 Vegetable fried rice with chicken medium spice 5/5 - This is the freshest most flavorful fried rice I have tasted.

This is the first thing I tried years ago and ordered repeatedly as well as my whole lunch party for years straight.\\n\\n25 - 5/5 Chicken, onions, and peppers in medium spice sauce that must be made by the gods themselves it is so flavorful.

        "When we first got seated our server was trying to catch up and was a bit frazzled, but as a server I totally understand that feeling. We told her we weren't in a hurry and she took a deep breath and thanked us for giving her a break. Her service was very prompt and knowledgeable about the food. And the food was incredible, especially for the price point! That's not a cop out for the food but I was pleased when we received our tab. We had a great time on our anniversary dinner and will definitely return\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nA girlfriend and I decided to meet here for lunch since neither of us had tried it. It's a very old and not very well kept building with a gravel parking lot so when I was greeted, not with a welcome but with a 'do you have a reservation?' from a very snobby waitress, I was immediately put off. No, we didn't have a reservation; it was 11:40 on a Wednesday morning and this isn't Capital City City Grille, lady. And when I told her no, I got the 'look' if you know what I mean (like I'm the idiot). And mind you, even though we didn't leave until 1, only half the tables were ever full. Onto the food: It seemed like a decent menu but the prices were way too high. I ordered a wrap with potato salad ($13 lunch plate price - wow). The wrap was horrible, filled with a very greasy aioli sauce that was dripping out of the overcooked tortilla, but the potato salad was good. We were visited ONCE in the 75 minutes we were there (still snobby, like we were inconveniencing her by being there) and had to track down the waitress in order to get our check. My friend really liked her salad which is the only reason this place is getting two stars instead of one. So if you're looking for over-priced mediocre food served by a snobby waitstaff in a building that's trying so hard to be trendy it won't even put a fresh coat of paint on their walls - this place is for you.\n\nStars:",

        "Review: I really want to give this place a good review.For what  they are  a bowling alley they really have a good set up.  IWe brought the family for a 13.99 deal per person , which was supposed to include  unlimited pizza, 2 hours  of bowling and shoes. Great deal. But when we arrived they were swamped , the cashier said they couldn't use the coupln because they were too swamped and didn't have pizza. He talked us into a similar deal which basically about the same price  but we got soda and popcorn.  But as we were bowling we saw tons of Pizza being made which seemed lame , especially since we were hungry  but didn't want bowling alley food.  Strange... \\n\\nHowever the alley itself is clean and neat and looks recently cleaned up / remodeled. They have day glo balls , bright colors and music videos going .. aesthetics were pleasing. \\n\\nWe had a good time all in all, just wished  we didn't feel baited and switched ...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

It didn't work on the 2nd room either! So, someone from the hotel had to manually let us in every time. Hahahah. It's actually funnier now that it's been a couple days. But, it was rough because there was quite a bit of attitude from as soon as I walked in to walking out. Maybe it's because so many other patrons are experiencing the same issues: it's a pretty worn down place. But still -- rough sauce.\nSo I would like to give it",

Most places I go to have some good finds, but you really have to take your time in there and look through piles of items that's worth keeping. \\n\\nAt Opportunity Village, I was able to see some wonderful pieces as far as vintage furniture, clothes, books, centerpieces, lamps, kitchen, dinner, and pieces. My favorite was the furniture. It's was either vintage pieces I came across or contemporary pieces with some artistic edge. It was just so entertaining to be able to look at these nice finds. Obviously I didn't buy any since they were all just too big to carry home alone, and it does take careful planning, but I did manage to snag some vintage and original hardback books of a few classics like Sherlock Holmes, Oliver Twist, and Mysterious Island for $1.99!!! So I bought 5 books.\\n\\nAlso, they have a nice gallery section dedicated to artwork. I'm not entirely sure if it's second hand owned art pieces or local artist's pieces, but it's cool either way to know that a nice thrift store like Opportunity Village features GREAT quality furniture, artwork, and such! I'll be back soon. FOR SURE!\n\nReview rating:",

I completely understand ordering good food and expecting to wait for it, but this was OUTRAGEOUS!!

        "Meh is about all I can say about Cabo. I feel like it is super over-hyped... We went in for dinner on a Tuesday night around 7pm. It was pretty crowded but there was no wait. They brought over chips & salsa. The chips were warm but I didn't get the feeling that they were made fresh. They were on the thicker side. The salsa was a mix of corn and tomatoes/peppers (pico de gallo). Not spicy and not really salsa, but ok. We each ordered our own combo taco plate ($10.50) which came with two tacos and a side. I got one BBQ Mahi taco and one Tavaruva Wahoo taco with fruit as my side (seasonal). I was incredibly underwhelmed with my food. The fish in both were way overcooked and dry. The wahoo taco was way salty and the mahi was under seasoned... Another thing that annoyed me, they only have flour tortillas... Really? A fish taco place with only flour tortillas... Even worse, they weren't homemade/fresh. They had that store bought flour tortilla smell. Come on guys... Step it up. My rating for this place is",

It's right next to a gas station which doesn't help with that image, nor does the parking situation. but once you get inside it has the atmosphere of a neighborhood diner.  The food was very well done, very fresh and tasty.  The chicken club was very good, with the cheese melted all over it.  The only thing that could have really been improved upon was the service.  The girls looked bored and like they didn't really want to be there.  But then again they also looked like they were in high school, and trying to make teenagers happy is a pointless effort.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Stopped in for the first time not having known for 10 years that we were neighbors.  I'll start with the fact that the owner/operator was extremely polite greeting you when you enter and welcoming you.  I had my 2 toddlers in tow, and this can be intimidating to most small shop owners knowing one bad move can cause chaos from a toddler.  We sat down ordered some meals, lamb gyro, chicken ka-bob sandwich, hummus.  Easy mediteranean meal almost imposible to mess it up.  We walked in at opening so it took 10 minutes or so for food, but the array of goods in the market to shop made the time fly.  With no prompting they took it upon them selves to split the gyru meal for my kids, which was awesome and a super time saver for me.  The flat bread pita was good more authentic to the chew than the buttery mall version (though I like both).  The meat was perfect the lamb tender with a nice sear on it, very generous thickness as well preserving the meat texture.  their tatziki was a chunky version with great flavor and a crisp cucumber crunch through-out very refreshing in the 100+ degree lunch temps we were having.  The chicken was good with a nice subtle flavor and plenty of juice left inside the well grilled meat.  \\nThe hummus was traditional and very smooth more dip than spread.  \\nOverall I am super impressed, the market has every canned and jarred good you could imagine from SPAM to stuffed Olive leaves and all stops in between.  The deli counter had a simple variety of olives and various feta cheeses, their produce was depleted (possibly because I walked in as they unlocked the doors) or not stocked yet.  I will be returning to shop and to eat again.  The welcoming owner made me feel as though my children will also be dining there regularly.  I will try to work my way through their menu board over the coming weeks, and will try to report back.\nSo I would like to give it",

WOW was I wrong!! \\n\\nThe service was slow, and the food was tasteless and cold.  It was the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. Even though we ate very little off our plates it wasn't until - the cashier asked me \\\"how was the food\\\"; that anyone even showed concern. I told the cashier it was \\\"terrible it just wasn't good\\\".  I wasn't going to speak to a manager initially however; the two cashiers talked me into speaking with a manger.

Most recently, a couple days ago. \\n\\nHere's the thing, this place is currently undergoing some major construction. There are no signs indicating the place is even open, let alone where to go since the front door is basically a disaster area of blasted asphalt and bare bones concrete blocks.\\n\\nThat said, these folks should be thanking the HEAVENS anyone is walking into their establishment.\\n\\nSo my recent visit went like this: Me, my Dad and my Aunt came in for lunch. Jesus was our server. Dad asked for the mini-chimi appetizer. I order a chicken burrito with fundido and verde sauce. No beans, just rice please.\\n\\nDad gets a full sized chimichanga, whilst my order is not only missing verde, but the rice. My order goes back once they realize the mistake...they bring it back, only now with rice still missing. Dad meanwhile realizes he's got the wrong item too.\\n\\nBrought the issue up with Jesus, who is clearly irritated and has the audacity to argue that my Dad ordered from the lunch menu. Thing is, I saw him point to the chimi on the appetizer section when he ordered. Wrong answer, Jesus.\\n\\nService was so rude, I'd be reluctant to return to this place ever again.\\n\\nWord to the wise: Get the attitude in check, Jesus. Don't blame the customer for your ordering errors... especially when people like us are willing to dine in your very dusty dining room as your establishment undergoes construction.\n\nStars:",

        "I agree with the other 1 star reviews. This place is a scam. \\n\\nWent there last night after a nice run at the craps table. I got duped into going into the VIP. Only after paying the $500 fee was I told that there was a drink minimum of $200 on top. Of course this was after the dance started and now I can't get my money back. Then the stripper told me that I needed to add a tip for the server and her. Now the $500 dance was going to be more like $800. I got up and demanded my Id and credit card back. They refused to give it back unless I signed off on the $200 hidden drink fee for drinks that never even arrived. I ended up leaving my I'd and credit card. \\n\\nLow and behold today I have a $400 charge on my card. I have already filed a dispute with my credit card company and plan on doing whatever I can to make sure other people are not scammed. \\n\\nThis place engages in unfair and deceptive trade practices and should be shut down. \\n\\nBottom line don't go there.

        "I rented a car from phx airport  and was going to return it to LAX on June 9. I wasn't sure if I was going to return the car earlier or later, so I asked the person at the counter what would I be charged. They said the rate I have, it would just be adjusted to the days I actually used. .. well to make a long story short, I returned the car one week early in Arizona. The original rental rate had me at just over 1,050 (taxes and fees made it this high). When I looked at my American express account, there was a pending charge for 395 plus the bill was over 1,500 (so I would have paid over 1,900). According to what I was told at the counter, the bill should have been much closer to 750. I called, after much discussion, they reduced the bill to my original 1,050 saying that is the best they could do. I called customer service again a week or so later. Both conversations said I signed the contract saying that the rate could change. I then told them what was said to me at the pickup counter. Both times they said I signed, which I did not knowing that they would not stand behind what was said. I then told both customer service representatives that if I was to stand at the counter and read the documents in their entirety, it would really slow down their rental capacity and so I relied on their own rental agents response, BIG mistake,. Hertz will never see my business ever again, they clearly don't care about the customer anywhere near their bottom line. I hope Hertz goes of business, I would never treat anyone the way Hertz treated me, I hope they are glad they have my money....greedy, greedy jerks\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "The two stars are for the food only. Otherwise, negative stars would  be in effect. WHO on earth could possibly find this place worth returning to? What a completely miserable experience. The bitchy emo service obviously leaves something to be desired, then again so does the ENTIRE restaurant! Sure, melted cheese in a crepe is good. Know what else is good? ANY melted cheese from any breakfast place and Not having to endure this hell hole. I am just upset that I went there in the early part of my day and am now in a foul mood as a result. I have been in Pittsburgh a few weeks and this place is without rival the worst brunch I've ever had (PA or CA) So, the one positive thing about it IS.... it has made me appreciate every other sub par brunch I've had up until this point.  Absolutely will never return. EVEN THE Orange juice was bad. Are you kidding?\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I was really really surprised to see all of the mediocre-to-bad reviews of this place. I've been going here for several years and wish I had known about it when I first moved to Charlotte! \\n\\nI can agree that the interior/decor isn't up-to-date or anything, so if that's what concerns you most about a place to eat, Kristopher's isn't for you. However, if good American food and friendly service is what concerns you most, I can't recommend this place enough. \\n\\nI had my first Buffalo wing at 21 (yeah, super late bloomer - guess I had a sheltered upbringing). Since then, I have made a point to try wings at just about every restaurant that offers them as a menu option. Kristopher's wings (medium heat, buffalo style) are the best wings I've ever had in my life, no exaggeration. Every single time I've been there the wings have been consistently amazing, so it's no fluke. The rest of the food is decent in my humble opinion, although in the interest of full disclosure - it's possible my love of the wings clouds my judgement of the other food. \\n\\nAnyway, that about sums it up. Oh, the service is always great when I'm there, and I'm not some kind of recognizable 'regular' to them as I don't live on that side of town and visit as often as I'd like. The hostesses/waitresses are always friendly and the service is always prompt. Plenty of TVs for sporting events are icing on the cake.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Nothing spectacular, but a not notch above Denny's & IHOP. And frankly, that's always the impression I thought they were going for...a solid, but not spectacular casual dining spot. \\n\\nI came to this location recently & realized Mimi's has changed quite a bit from last time I stopped in one (honestly, this review could probably be for any Mimi's, not just this one). I always remember there being a slight French theme to this place, but it seems like they've gone even further now, and have made this even more apparent. I just don't think casual dining like this really lends itself to French (I always think of French restaurants being more quaint...and not chain). \\n\\nThat being said, the breakfast I had was fine. Granted I only had oatmeal & pumpkin muffin (which was quite good). My mom has some sort of mini waffles topped w/apples & bacon, This is where the whole French meets casual dining just seems a little off. She liked them & thought they were tasty, but seeing these little waffles served all \\\"fancy\\\" at a causal dining spot just seemed off. \\n\\nI'd come back though (our service was fine), and next time I guess maybe the initial shock of the \\\"new\\\" atmosphere will probably wear off...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I went there two times in Jan 2012: the first night the waiter was without personality, it took a long time to get our food and the restaurant was almost empty BUT the food was good. The second night the place was packed, it took even longer to get our food, it was unbelievably hot inside BUT our waiter was great and the good was good.  The BEST things about this restaurant is that it is part of the Grand Arizona Resort which means they drive you from the resort to the restaurant and back and  you can charge food to your room.

        "Open Road Tours nearly ruined our vacation!  We booked our Grand Canyon tour several weeks in advance, but they called to cancel LAST MINUTE (literally 5pm on the Sunday before our Monday tour).  The customer service rep cited weather issues and told us that given their 25 years of experience, there would be fog in the canyon and it really wouldn't be worth the trip up there.\\n\\nAfter about an hour of wallowing in dejection, we optimistically decided to just try calling around to see if any other tour companies were operating.  Every single tour company we called (we went to tripadvisor and started with the highest rated) was still operating tours to the Grand Canyon but many of them were full.  We finally managed to snag the last 2 spots with another company and there were absolutely NO visibility issues at all.  In fact, the day was extremely clear and the Grand Canyon was spectacular.\\n\\nOpen Road Tours was extremely unprofessional in not helping us find an alternate way to see the Grand Canyon after we expressed that it was our whole purpose in visiting Phoenix and the day we booked was the only day we could go.  Rather than call peers to secure us spots, they told us there was nothing they could do unless we wanted to book on another day (impossible since we were leaving the next day).  Given that there were absolutely no actual weather issues, and they had actually already attempted to reschedule the tour prior to the \\\"weather cancellation\\\" due to insufficient bookings on Monday, the entire experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\\n\\nPARTING THOUGHT: Why take a chance with your vacation and book with an unreliable tour company when there are so many excellent options in the area?\nSo I would like to give it",

        "The best part of staying at this hotel was its location. It is literally near everything you could possibly want... Target, Super Cuts, Ross, A zillion restaurants, nail salons, etc. If it wasn't 103 degrees outside, we could have walked just about anywhere. No matter where we needed to go over the past two days, we arrived before the air conditioning even cooled off the car. \\n\\nHere's what was great: the service was fabulous! The people we had the pleasure of meeting at the front desk were beyond nice. They were both helpful and cheery and even funny. The breakfast was a-okay. I'm not one to take down a huge plate of eggs and bacon, so the yogurt, juice and muffins was just fine for me! The beds were super comfy... almost as good as mine at home! And finally, the swimming pool! Although there were about 4 million kids in there, it was a blast for all of them. The pool was big enough to fit a bunch of cannon-balling kids as well as plenty of space for parents.\\n\\nHere's why I took off a star... something is seriously wrong with the engineering of the bathroom door!!! Our bathroom had two doors that swung together (like full length old western tavern doors) and a latch flipped over to hook them together on the inside. Well, my 12 year quickly figured out that by sliding the hotel door key up through the crack in the doors, you could very LOUDLY unlock the bathroom doors. The bonus... one would swing open! I was the first victim and nearly fell off the toilet. My son was next (I was the prankster this time!) and may be scarred for life. \\n\\nFor TWO DAYS anytime one of us was in the bathroom doing anything, someone scared the heck out of you trying to be funny. It came to a nearly debilitating peak this morning when my daughter flipped the latch, snuck in, and dumped a bucket of icy water on me in the shower. She then yanked the curtain open and I nearly fell out trying to tackle her to the ground! \\n\\nUgh, although seriously funny, all of this could have been avoided with a simple door knob.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: Since when do they put cheese in a Filet O' Fish sandwich?  It's been awhile since I ate at this franchise. Haven't set foot and bought a meal here in a while, but I was feeling lightheaded when shopping and I ended up here because it was the nearest place to get a bite to eat.  \\n\\nStaff was pleasant. It was near closing, no line, 3 employees handled my order. So I got my order remarkably fast. Which made me wonder how long was my food under those warmers. Well I was just about to find out!\\n  \\nOpened up my sandwich and I kid you not, there was a slice of dried up cheddar cheese in the the filet fish sandwich...ewwww...(see pic) I didn't want to bother remaking it, so I just picked it off.  Then I took a bite. Yup under the heat lamps for too long alright.  The sandwich was way too dry.  The bun wasn't stale at least.  Only got in two little bites and I was done.   The fries were the saving grace though.  It was hot and crisp, so I had a few of those till I wasn't dizzy no more and chucked the rest of my meal.  \\n\\nAt the time of my visit near closing, the tables were clean, the soda fountain area was not maintained though. Ice cubes and melted ice all over the place.  The trash bins were full. One of them had trash bulging out of it..gross.\\n \\nThe prices on Mickey D's so not worth the $6 I paid. I can go across the street and get a cooked to order meal that isn't loaded with sodium and preservatives over at the Filipino restaurant for the same price! So I'd skip this place unless you are in desperate need to eat.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Though the portions have remained relatively generous, I would rather have a smaller amount of better food, if that is what is required to up the quality.\\n\\nAfter an especially harrowing few weeks, the boss decided to reward me for not going on a homicidal rampage by giving me a gift card for Harper's.  So, on a Wednesday evening right after work, off to Harper's I went to spend the balance of my gift card.  I say this only in that if I were spending my own money, rather than the boss man's, I would not have ordered a steak at Harper's, I would save that for a steak place.\\n\\nTheir menu is on the smaller side, but it contains a variety of beef, chicken, pork and fish dishes.   I decided to splurge and try their prime rib served with a loaded baked potato ($25).  It was an inch thick, medium as requested and looked delicious.  Upon cutting into it - bleh.  Tough and chewy, and the dull knife was not helping out.  I had to saw at the piece of meat to get bites cut and immediately dipped it into the tasty au jus (salty meat juice, yum) to get any kind of flavor.  It honestly tasted like a hunk of meat taken off of the roast beef carving station at some kind of buffet.  Harper's isn't a \\\"steak\\\" place, but I expected better.  The loaded baked potato was delicious.  \\n\\nFor dessert, there was a \\\"homemade\\\" pumpkin cheesecake ($6).  It was fine, nothing special.  It was not very creamy, and not very pumpkiny, but that might be a personal preference of mine as far as cheesecake consistency and flavor goes.  I wouldn't bother to order it again.\\n\\nMy server, Tonji, was spectacular.  She kept my ginger ales coming and continued to check on how my meal was going, without being interruptive.  The manager did stop by and ask how the meal was and I should have spoken up, but I hate being \\\"that girl\\\".  \\n\\nI have spent all of the $50 gift card and wouldn't...\n\nStars:",

There are a few drawbacks to Sky Harbor as well..\\n\\n1) Terminals are very far apart (i.e. United to US Airways)\\n2) Not many food options post security screening\\n3) Rental Car hub too far from main airport.\\n\\nOutside of that, this is a great airport.  Also, easy to gain status if you fly US Airways.  Also it's well air conditioned, considering 8 months out of the year the temps are difficult to deal with. My rating for this place is",

        "Review text:\nI hate to admit this because I fear the stone throwing that will occur, but I'm just not a fan of Monty's food.  Madisonites love this diner and I certainly understand its charm.  Its interior is quaintly decorated with very much a 50s diner feel. There's a pie and cake display case up front.  They're always popular for brunch on the weekends.  Service is friendly and this is a great neighborhood spot. \\n\\nBUT, I've yet to have anything from Monty's that I like.  I've been there many many times, for brunch, for lunch, and for dinner, and each time, I've been disappointed in the food.  I really want to like this place, but I seem to be unable to find a dish on the menu that keeps me coming back.  \\n\\nMy most recent visit was with a friend from out of town.  I ordered their pozole which was an item I hadn't seen before on their menu and it sounded intriguing.  But when it came out, I was disappointed.  I found the chunks of pork a bit tough, the dish heavy on the hominy and the dish itself lacking in flavor.  It felt one noted.  It wasn't bad; it just wasn't for me.  I was really hoping that this would be the dish I'd be excited to come back to Monty's for but I came away disappointed. \\n\\nI ate less than half of my dish but I decided that the rest wasn't worth a takeout box.  Unfortunately, this is how I often feel about Monty's food.\n\nReview rating:",

        "This was my second time to the T. Cook's bar for Happy Hour.  Rather than the intended Mediterranean, the bar decor reminds me of a classy old school Hawaii hotel bar ala Elvis' movies.  The Great American Martini lives up to its name - Vodka straight up with blue cheese olives.  It's half price at Happy Hour as are the other featured cocktails and all the appetizers.  The Moroccan roasted chickpeas are addictive and inexpensive.  I also recommend the spicy seared tuna lettuce wraps.  On Tuesday and Thursdays they also have a featured $2 chef's choice taco.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Wow, I'm going to have to show this to my friend who thought I was \\\"being too picky\\\" when in essence, he obviously  has some simple ass taste buds.\\n\\nIt started out wonderfully. The sun was about 1/2 hour from setting and casting that orange glow that Phoenix does so well. We went there for the ambiance. I offered to treat. Little did I know, I was in for a treat and it sure as hell wasn't a good one.\\n\\nSo we get Kathy (I think that was this crappy waitress' name).  She takes my friend's drink order and I'm still deciding and she just walks away. No \\\"I'll be back\\\" or anything customer service-y like that. Then she comes back and takes my drink order. Fine.\\n\\nShe suggests the Pork chops and even though I eat 90% vegetarian, I go with her suggestion. Cause the alternative is one boring salad choice.  It comes back pink and rubbery. What the--?I don't give a crap what anyone says, pork ain't supposed to be pink. That  means it ain't cooked and I ain't eating it. So I send it back and it comes back clearly microwaved for a few seconds and guess what? Still freakin' pink on the inside.\\n\\nLovely! So this girl asks if I want to try the  Chilean Sea Bass. Ok, now I've had too much alcohol and I'm not thinking properly cause that shit's endangered - - very politically incorrect but I'm near my boiling point  so I  agree and think surely something's getting spit in or on.\\n\\nWell, she brings out beers stating that \\\"he bought you  2 beers for the trouble\\\". Huh? He who? The waiter? The manager? And she damn near slams them on the table. Now I'm about to ghetto but my friend just casts me a look that puts me in check.\\n\\nSo the sea bass finally comes and you are seriously not going to believe this-----it was pink and pretty much undercooked. And of course, I had her take it back and then it came back flaky. I ate a few forkfuls but was pretty much frickin done at that point and now burdened with a 3-beer buzz within 1.5 hours. Not good.\\n\\nThat's why they put the restaurant on top of those damn rocks so you'll...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "The shop keep is very patient and pleasant to deal with but I regret to write that my last arrangement missed the mark in more ways than one.\\n\\nI spent $60 dollars( after a 10% discount)  on an arrangement that is advertised on their website as the \\\"Rose delight\\\" which is mostly yellow roses and red mini roses. That seems simple two hues.  What was delivered are pink roses , white mini roses, some purple flower I cannot make out from my friend's photo and only 3 yellow roses with peach colored ends. There are not any fully yellow roses or red mini roses what so ever.  The odd thing is when I went down to the store that day I looked in the cooler and say that they had yellow roses in stock.   The roses look old and are fully open with wrinkled ends not closed and fresh.  The flowers in the arrangements that was delivered don't look any thing like the fresh flowers that I saw when I was in Oliver's ordering this.\\n\\nI am am really let down that my arrangement doesn't have the colors I had wanted. From my friend's photo there appear to be 2 dozen roses or possibly more , so value for money is still very much there.  \\n\\n.\nSo I would like to give it",

Your facility has cared for two of my dogs, Bootzer and Mattie. However, I will no longer be bringing my pets to Alta Vista.\\n\\nThe reason for this letter is to inform you of my disappointment in your staff. On numerous occasions I brought Bootzer in for a consistent, honking cough. Each time your staff would test him for something new; such as Valley Fever or Kennel Cough and each time, after paying around $300 for a specialized test, we would be told our dog was healthy and just needed to shed a little weight.\\n\\nOn our last visit we met with **** ******. **** examined Bootzer and did not perform any tests, rather he suggested a prescription weight loss food and then tried to up sell us on flea baths and preventative de-worming. He had no explanations for Bootzer's cough except that he was overweight and small dogs often breath in dust and it could be a response to that.\\n\\nOn July 13th my husband and I had to euthanize our beloved Bootzer due to his trachea collapsing. The emergency hospital we took him to was extremely knowledgeable and knew right away what was causing his distress. After speaking with the veterinarian we learned that collapsed trachea is a common problem with small dogs, and Chihuahuas are a high risk for this problem and its not uncommon for this to be a hereditary issue. We were also informed that the cough and his lack of being able to exercise should have been a significant sign to any experienced, professional veterinarian. This could have been treated earlier with medication, a harness instead of a collar and putting a humidifier near his crate.\\n\\nAs you can expect, my family is very saddened by the loss of our friend and frustrated that not only could this have been prevented, but that we could have improved the quality...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Houston's Esplanade always did more things right than not, but it had also been declining, almost imperceptibly, since the nineties. Pricing consistently outstripped inflation, the kitchen's impressive attention to detail began to slip on a couple entrees, and for some time, they ceased reciting prices on heavily marked up and misleadingly touted \\\"specials\\\" .  \\n\\nOur first visit to Hillstone represented an acceleration of that decline. \\n\\nThe stone and glass prairie style building's very attractive inside and out, but I couldnt find the front door. Neither could a bunch of other drivers, circling the property. Maybe the architect feels this adds to one's sense of discovery, but I found sardining my way through an overcrowded megabar at the wrong end of the building, in order to locate the restaurant checkstand, to be an unwelcome pain in the ass. \\n\\nOur table split an attractively plated $17 sushi sampler that was tasty, but we never got plates.  The food's always been quality and still is, but a vinagrette on the steak and noodle salad wasmore acidic than before, and a fish entree was described as \\\"a little overcooked\\\".  Other entrees were excellent, as before. A small quality step down from across the street. \\n\\nOur server oozed a scripted, contemptuous charm, designed to inflate the bill and tip with every breath, yet provided less tangible service than I normally get in an IHOP.  Houston's staff, at times, could be stiff and occasionally obsequious - but never this agressively insincere or useless.  My water glass was empty almost half the evening.  We asked for a bottle that eventually arrived, so we could serve ourselves. That ran out too, and sat for ages.  We intended to split a dessert, but the waiter pushed so hard the whole table felt condescended to and we opted to skip it.  \\n\\nTo my astonishment, not once during the meal were we solicited as to how our food was or if we required anything.  At least not while we were eating, when it might've mattered. That changed as soon as my wife...\nSo I would like to give it",

The wine they served was really good. I had an amazing port that paired really well with the chocolate truffles they served.

An abundance of white rocking chairs sets a relaxed mood...and more comfortable than the standard airport chairs.  Plenty of eating places.

Its really small, tries to combine to many different facets, and the bands they book are typically emo / pop rock bands.  On occasion theyve had a random local punk show, but for the most part this place is for the journal writing, scarf wearing, horn rimmed glasses crowd.

        "After a miserable experience at McHale's in September 2012, we thought we've never go back.  Well, we did go back.  We had an old Groupon that was going to expire and decided to give McHale's another try.  What a difference!  Ironically, we sat that the EXACT same table, and also ironically we ended up going on another Friday night.  But this time there was a total turnaround on all fronts.  The waitress was attentive and timely throughout our whole meal, and the food was MUCH MUCH better.   We ordered different items on the menu from last time, and they didn't disappoint at all.    It was like a totally different restaurant, and one that we WOULD go to again.\\n\\nI've bumped up the rating from 1 star to 3 stars - I'm leery to give it a higher rating since I don't know whether the first experience or the second experience was the \\\"out of the norm\\\" version of the place.

I don't remember much about it before, and after my experience there last night, I will remember not to go there again.\\n\\nWe were celebrating my friend's birthday. We got there about 7:45 with a party of 5, and there were a few tables open. The only table that was large enough to accommodate us, a table for 8, was available in the back. The brunette hostess starts to take us back there, but then the blond hostess says \\\"we have a large party coming in and they're going to be eating and drinking for a while.\\\" She points to a small table for 4 and says \\\"You'll sit there.\\\" Confused because the restaurant allegedly doesn't take reservations, we offered to wait until one of the 6-person tables opens up. The blond hostess refused. \\n\\nParagraph in which I rant about the blond hostess: This girl can't be older than 17. The whole time she interacted with us, she was rude, dismissive, and acted like it was a bother for her to be doing her job. She gave us so much attitude, like she was doing us a favor by seating us at all. No wonder people always comment on how bad the service is at this place - if your first impression is with a condescending high schooler who needs an attitude adjustment, it would take a lot to negate that first impression. Also, someone needs to tell this girl that tights are not pants. If I wanted to see someone's a$$ while I ate, I'd go to a strip club. /end rant\\n\\nWe were seated at the tiny 4-person table, two people on one side of the table (who wants to eat with a corner of the table sticking into their chest, as the hostess arranged the seats?). The 8-person table sat vacant for the first hour we were in the restaurant, and we were almost done with our meal when the allegedly expected party came. Funny how they don't take reservations, yet they would not sit us at the only table available that would accommodate our party.\\n\\nOur server, Ryan, was great and attentive. I think he realized...\n\nReview rating:",

However, I craved an all you can eat Chinese Buffet and went to Golden Coin because it was close to work. Probably the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to, I take that back  \\\"No Probably\\\" about it, Golden Coin is the worst Chinese Buffet I have ever been to!   \\n\\n                                  Eight Items on the Buffet \\n\\nFried Wontons, Rice, Lo Mien, Vegetables, Chicken, Chicken Wings, Egg Rolls, & Sweet and Sour pork\\n\\n\\nAs I took my first bite of rice a single thought ran through my head: \\\"How can a Chinese Restaurant not cook rice right\\\"?  If the rice wasn't bad enough the Lo Mien sure was, not sure how to describe that taste, but it's not Lo Mien, so I will stick with tasteless soggy noddles. The eggrolls were equally bad, small, cut in half, and horrible and once again a taste that is hard to describe, so lets go with tasteless again, after all it worked when describing the Lo Mien. Moving on to the sweet and sour pork, this dish consisted of  small,dried out,  hard pieces of what  I am assuming was pork covered in a reddish sauce that had the consistency of water.  Tasteless doesn't begin to describe that dish! The Wontons can best be described as greasy crispy noddles and don't even get me started on the chicken and wings. How in the world does Golden Coin prepare that stuff? It's awful. \\n\\nSo there yo have it, that's it. The entire Golden Coin Buffet. Don't think you can wash down a bad meal with soda....no refills on the sodas at Golden Coin!!!!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

We just took the tortilla chips that come with the burgers (I did not want the calories that come with French fries). Bad choice. Next time I will take the calories and the fries. I also had the fish tacos (they actually  were called by the name of the fish which I forgot). They were great. Good quantity and quality. Served, as I recall, with a very tasty salad. The third item I had was a chicken curry on top of a bed of greens. Again, very good quantity and very tasty.\\nAbout the Service - It was lunch time. The place gets very busy. The staff hustles. They run thru the maze of tables. They get everything right and maintain a cool composure. They are friendly and go out of their way to be helpful.

We got in kind of late and checked in around 9:30 pm. Check-in was fine. We let the clerk know we needed a ride to the airport in the morning and it turns out that you can leave your car there if you're planning to stay on your return trip and the stay is 14 days or less (I asked after a friend informed me you can do this--beats paying for airport parking!). We were flying to Hawaii and would be gone for 10 days, so this was a good deal.\\n\\nOur room was on the ground floor and was not nicer than a Motel 6 as far as I remember Motel 6s being from when I was a kid. It was hot and humid in the hotel so I turned on the AC. That clanky piece of crap managed to wake me up every single time it went on during the night. A HORRIBLE night of sleep.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, there were a bunch of college-aged drunk kids staying in the hotel who showed up around 10:30 pm. They hung out right outside of my door and were up and down the stairs laughing and being obnoxious until 1 am. I typically am not shy about sticking my head out the door and telling people to be quiet, but since I was alone with my kids, I didn't think it was the best idea. I called the front desk around 11 pm and they said their driver (who doubles as security) would drive back there when he returned from the airport, in about 20 minutes. It was not 20 minutes, that's for sure. Considering we had to be up at 5 am, waiting ANY amount of time was infuriating. They should have had someone on the premises who can act in the capacity of a security guard or something. I heard the van drive by around 1 am and that's when the inconsiderate a-holes finally went up to their rooms.\\n\\nIn the morning (at 5 am) I couldn't help myself and as we were heading to the front desk to catch the shuttle, I knocked loudly on one of the doors of the worst offenders and called them jerks.

But my experience with EHF was nonetheless subpar and beyond disappointing.  I called early in the morning (at 8 AM) and was advised that they were no longer accepting delivery orders for the day....completely understandable.  The lady on the phone invited me to drive in, though, saying she could accommodate a pick-up order.  I drove 25 miles into the store, had a vase, and just wanted to spend a minute walking around and putting together a quick arrangement.  I was told that I'd have to come back in an hour -- and the lady at the front desk was not sympathetic at all.\\n\\nAgain, I understand it was a busy day.  But if you couldn't accommodate two minutes of a walk-in customer, you shouldn't have invited me into the store.  \\n\\nThere was a happy ending, at least:  I discovered a great little florist a mile away who did immediately take care of me when I walked in and put together a beautiful arrangement.  http://www.flowersplusonline.com/  They're terrific!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The stuff they sell is all made-in-China cheap plastic crap and fake brand-name clothes, shoes and purses. There isn't much in line of food except greasy messes of sugary doughnuts and other fried foods made in questionable cookspaces. Honestly you just get tired of the repetitiveness here because every booth has the same stuff at the same price. Don't come here expecting to find some awesome rare yard-sale finds. I've been to numerous better flea markets with much more local flair and variety as well as fresh local fruits and veggies. Skip this sketchy place.\nSo I would like to give it",

Since drivers went on strike they're hiring psychos and allowing Vegas locals to be long-hauled and disrespected. Worse service by far. I am a local in Vegas so heed this warning. For 4 years this cab company has been ruining our tourism by displaying Neanderthal business practices and hiring sexual offenders and criminals. Nice job Ace. Tourists and locals seek anyone.but this.company and their sister cab companies. Deposits for drivers dont exist. Taking the expressway NOT the only way to get to a location.

I got the Breakfast Burrito. It was cold, and the cheese was hard. My friend really enjoyed the Shrimp Omelette, but did mention it was luke warm. Could be an attribute to our waitress performing Houdini disappearing acts. \\nOverall, this place is good not great for brunch. It would be a place that if I had to have a fourth or fifth option for brunch, I might think about trying it again during this time.

I've also had an appetizer sampler with quesadillas, nachos, and taquitos- it was tasty while drinking but for the price, it's a better deal to put such a snack together at home. \\n\\nThe redeeming factor of this restaurant is its patio. It's set up in such a way that very little sun gets in, and there are misters all over. The breeze blows just right so it's always nice and cool outside, even in the middle of the summer. \\n\\nThis might be a good option to come for some drinks and hang out on the patio, but don't expect to be impressed with good Mexican food- you are looking in the wrong place!\n\nStars:",

        "Review: UGH! Really want to rate this place higher but after this weekend I just can't do it. Sitting in front of a TV, waaaay before the game starts, decked out in our team's gear head-to-toe, the d*ck manager walks in front of us and changes the channel so that the TV we're watching is on the SAME channel that 14 other TVs are programmed to and he was so kind as to move our game to one of the teeny tiny TVs. We asked if he could please change it back - he literally looked at us and said 'No - you can move though.'  Maybe he doesn't like a bunch of women sucking down brewskis watching football? Too much sexiness for his bar? LOL \\n\\nHis loss, and Santisi's too ... \\n\\nOther than that - the wings are good, beer is cold, and patio is fun.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "After a large weight loss I no longer had any bras that fit correctly, or at all.  I decided to bite the bullet and get a professional fitting.  I was nervous about what this would really entail?  Did I have to undress in front of someone, would she be handling my, ahem, cleavage? After debating this for weeks, I finally gave in and just went.  BTW, their current hours are Mon-Sat 10-5.  The shop was decent enough, clean, a bit outdated, but lots and lots of bras.  Big ones!  That was a plus for me, as a big-boobed girl.  I have always ordered my bras online because of my difficulty finding bras in my size, but at this point, I had no idea what size I was anymore.  The fitting consisted of (fully-clothed) a tape measurement below and above the breasts, and then at the fullest point.  She did a little hands-on around the arm pit level area for a feel of how full you are (not on the nips or anything.)  She guesstimated what size I was (correctly I must add) and then gave me a bra to try on in a regular dressing room.  Perfect fit.  I tried on 6 bras or so, and walked out with 4 of them within 30 minutes.  Her prices are comparable to other online lingerie stores, but you get the bonus of knowing that your purchase actually fits.  She has a huge selection of cute, sexy and functional bras.  My cleavage is now perky again and my back and shoulders feel so much better.  Why did I wait so long?  Go now!\nSo I would like to give it",

It is hard to see the ball and it is not visually appealing. The reason given is they were burned by a heat wave one year. I appreciate the honesty, but seriously you are going to charge north of 175/player and cheap out on the proper care and maintenance. Never saw that in Scottsdale or Palm Desert.  The rental clubs are older Callaway Razr that were not in the best of condition. Another gimmick is a beat the pro on a par three. There is no pro. Basically you 'bet' that you will hit the green. If you don't, whatever you bet, you get in a gift certificate to the pro shop. If you do, you get some additional bonus added to the gift certificate. I had looked in the pro shop while there and nothing caught my eye. It lessened the experience. Final bad part is that you are nowhere close to a place taxis go, so they call one for you. It took over an hour to get picked up.\\n\\nConclusion: Not enough value given the price, cannot recommend until they do the right thing with maintenance.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I was so worried about the other animals I carried him in and would not put him on a floor other dogs were on. Visit went great and the cost for everything was $104 so I left happy. \\n\\nA few days later my dog was sick and coughing so I took him in.  Turns out it was kennel cough he got because they gave him an inhalation kennel cough vaccine instead of a shot (Since they are the experts I think they did this on purpose to get us back).  He also had conjunctivitis (where would he get this since he is NEVER around another dogs or kids, just me). They came back with 2 prices, one on the high side which included x-rays approx. $450 (to be sure it wasn't something else) and one on the low side (low only to their profit) approx. $250.  I went through and removed things, I didn't think I needed a retina stain for $37 or the $37 antibiotic shot since they were selling me antibiotic pills for $30, I also didn't want the steroids $30 but they talked me into that, I got medicine for his eyes (another $35) and the check up itself was reasonable at $40. \\n\\nSo I ended up with about $140 for something they caused in the first place.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

She hesitated and then went on this whole diatribe about how it used to be free, and then it wasn't and now it kinda is, but she wasn't sure.  I swear that's exactly what she said.  So she hesitantly gives me this paper, pulled off from a whole stack mind you, of the Internet name and password.  At this point I'm confused...do you not want me to be here?  Is it free?  I finally got my answer when I logged on with no issues, it's free.  Why all the hassle??\\n\\nThe only reason I can see (and seriously a big one) is the coffee shop hanger on-ers.  I can only imagine how this has become an epidemic in spots like this.  Hip spots with lots of students and recent grads who want to scope out the free internet havens.  I get it....the coffee shop wants you to get your coffee, hang out for approximately 2 hours and leave.  I'm sure this is not the case...and that people hang out enough that they could easily put on an apron and handle orders behind the counter.  So long story short, this place is PACKED.  Packed like you usually have to take a couple laps to find a free table....or even lone chair!  It's a little annoying. Plus, you're most likely going to see what the person next to you/on top of you is doing.

        "Review: I stopped in to Bossa Nova for a holiday party on a busy Friday night in December. Although the restaurant side looked empty, the bar was packed. It seemed like people who were not a part of the party were still coming in. A little odd seeing the party guests had a live band, appetizers and were giving out prizes.  \\nWith the appetizer stations, we were able to try many different appetizers from quesadillas to calamari to sushi and back to meatballs. It seemed like Bossa Nova was trying to satisfy varying appetites by offering everything from Italian to Japanese. Overall, the food was average. I was not overy excited about any of it. I enjoyed the drinks much more, especially the Spansh wines. The service was great. We had 3 different bartenders ask us what we wanted while another was making our drinks. Everytime I finished my last bite and was about to have an empty plate, a waiter appeared out of nowhere to wisk away my dirty dish. \\nHowever, this is not a casual, laid back, every day type of bar. I can't put my finger on exactly what it is, but the atmosphere definitely gave off the \\\"I'm better than all of you\\\" type of vibe. Maybe it was the fact that they charge for th coat check?\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Today is St. Joseph's Day, a day that in Italy and many traditional Italian-American households is as special as St. Patrick's Day is to the Irish, and a day rich in food rituals.  To mark the occasion, I decided that after work I would have a multi-course dinner at one of Champaign-Urbana's \\\"Italian\\\" restaurants.  Let me first preface my review with some background.  I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, in a traditional Italian-American household where food was a centerpiece of family life and the table was the \\\"sacra tavola\\\" or sacred table.  I dined in restaurants in Little Italy and Brooklyn where the wait staff was fresh \\\"off the boats\\\" and barely spoke English and the owners and chefs were all old school Italians who had menus often hand-written and dictated by what was fresh and available in the markets and there was a sense of tradition in the entire dining experience.  Their tables were often occupied by members of \\\"La Famiglia\\\" but we won't go there.  I have no such high expectations from the local \\\"Eye-talian\\\" businesses.  Anyway, I decided upon The Great Impostor , er, Impasta.  The d\\u00e9cor bordered on tacky, with prints of Italian posters taped to the sides of the booths.  Tape?  Really?  Service was slow and perfunctory.  The meal started with bread, olive oil, and cheese for the dipping.  The oil seemed decent enough but the cheese was not Parmigiano Reggiano.  I ordered a glass of the house Chianti, which was drinkable.  For my appetizer, I chose the Sausage in Crust.  The sausage was unremarkable and under-seasoned and the crust was bone dry.  The small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp.  My main course was the Linguini Pescatore, described as clams, mussels and shrimp with spicy marinara and ripe olives served over homemade linguini.  The mussels were borderline, the shrimp decently done, and the clams of questionable origin.  The sauce had a nice spice to it but did not encourage the ritual \\\"fare la scarpetta\\\", which means to wipe your plate clean with a...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nDamnitt Ulta!  Why can't you stock ALL of your product at the Ulta cosmetic table reliably??  \\n\\nI have received more than a few Ulta gift certificates from my husband as gifts and I always get burned when I go in to redeem them; needing X, Y and Z, but only being able to find X in a shade darker than I use, and Y is out of stock out, and I can find 4 tubes of Z, but they are all testers and have already been opened.  \\n\\nI like Ulta's cosmetic line and would use it exclusively, but it it's impossible to fill my cosmetic bag with Ulta's stuff because they are apparently incapable of keeping the inventory stocked and organized!  How hard is it to have a few of each item and color and ONE tester??  \\n\\nAdding to the frustration is that when you have to backfill your cosmetic bag with other cosmetic brands (that you couldn't test the colors on because they don't have testers) and you are pretty much screwed out of $11 if you get home and discover that a Revlon True Beige is not remotely the same color across the board in their different foundation lines.  Aaargh!\\n\\nOh, and their coupons have so many product exclusions that's it's actually kinda funny, kinda like a game to see what you actually can use their coupons on...not much.\\n\\nThe only good thing that I noticed on my last visit to Ulta was that they are now offering an extensive selection of name brand rollerball perfumes, so now I don't need to get a huge bottle of my favorite Calvin Klein Euphoria perfume for my purse, I can get it in a handy little $20 rollerball.  So yay for that!\\n\\n\\nFinally, the parking here sucks.  Protip: I suggest you park over by Fry's on the other side of the block.  Otherwise use the Ulta in Chandler for better parking.\n\nStars:",

Every time... EVERY TIME we went there, we left reeking of smoke.  There's no smoking inside, of course, but it always happened.  Maybe it's due to poor ventilation, or the fact that the employees were regularly outside smoking, but we always left smelling like we were in a bar.\\n\\nThen, the tables were usually dirty.  When we would order our drink, we would usually have to get ourselves a napkin, wet it, and wipe our table ourselves. Not surprising, as most of the employees I've encountered there (with the exception of the very nice older woman) seemed pretty put out when I asked for anything.\\n\\nIn any case, we have internet access at home now, and haven't been back to Katerbean since. I guess that is really the only thing this place has going for it.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I haven't bought tires in 8 years! Don't get all crazy on me, I've bought a second car so didn't need to. The last time I did was at a Discount Tire and had a pleasant experience and a great price, so decided to try them again at a different location when it was time to get tires put on my latest car.\\n\\nGlad I came here. The customer service cannot be beat. The sales team is very courteous and upfront with you in regards to the conditions of your tires and what you should purchase. The salesman I dealt with was shocked I had gotten so many years and miles on a basic tire that he recommended I go that route again, rather than trying to convince me to upgrade. What?! He then told me it was because they do not work on a commission. That helps your wallet out a lot, considering I was expecting to pay way more for new tires than I actually did.\\n\\nAll in all I was extremely happy with the customer service, the price, the amazing warranty of free tire replacement and repair throughout the duration of my tires (if purchased as an upgrade, in which I did) and how smooth and nice my car now rides, exactly how they explained it would after install. They even replaced the valves. \\n\\nI will be back here soon to get new tires on my other car that they worked on 8 years ago. Now I admit that car is way overdue for new rubber, but I hardly drive it now so don't judge. :)\nSo I would like to give it",

I cannot believe this place has not been reviewed yet. I guess it is a best kept secret. \\n\\nThere were four in our party and we ordered a variety of sandwiches that ranged from a traditional Reuben, turkey and Swiss on a bagel to a pastrami and Swiss on marble rye and a turkey and cheese on a bread type that escapes me. Regardless, all the sandwiches were very good to excellent. The meat was lean and adequately piled on. The vegatables on the sandwiches were very fresh. All sandwiches came with a Kosher pickle spear and we opted for bags of Snyder of Hanover chips. I haven't had Snyder chips since I left Pittsburgh eons ago. \\n\\nThe amount of sandwiches offered were many. The staff were efficient and three-rivers friendly. \\n\\nI failed to realize that they offered Matzo ball soup. I will have to save that for a return trip to PGH.

        "Review: The aroma as I stepped out of the car was enticing. The atmosphere of the shop is exactly what one would hope for in a small town, natural pork shop. Samples on the counter were yummy and a nice way to try something new. Selection was great. I picked up two end pork loins to make homemade pulled pork, a frozen rolled loin for later, maple sausage for breakfast tomorrow and piggy ears for my dog - whose disappearance means they are good and he doesn't want to share. Glad they had the buns I forgot at the grocery store and the green chili burrito is as good as they say. All being said, I walked out for all this at $50, which was a little high - but for natural pork which is IMPOSSIBLE to find, I paid it. I hate the \\\"solution of phosphates\\\", blah blah blah added to grocery pork. I was surprised the burrito was $4.50 when I looked at the receipt at home. Still, good food, great service and supporting a local business is worth it!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Sound engineering FAILED MISERABLY here.\\n\\nAs a performer, backstage is deplorable and quite inconvenient.\\n\\nSave your money, and go to Chicago for good shows.  \\n\\nSadly, Madison's trick to push all the students out of the downtown area, and move in the Yuppies is failing, or maybe the yuppies don't have good appreciation of music, and as long as it costs a lot it *MUST* be good...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "(More like a 3.5, but I'll round up because it is a nice place with friendly staff).  I arrived on a bleh Friday around 11:15 for an early lunch with a girlfriend.  Located on Park Rd near Tyvola/Fairview, the small shopping center also includes a Harris Teeter, 1900 Mexican Grill and Dragonfly chinese, parking is ample and well lit.  \\n\\nThe friendly and smiling hostess promptly sat me - there was only 1 other table seated and the wait staff was meandering about, cleaning and straightening up with busy work.  My drink order was taken, my 2 lovely lunch dates arrived shortly thereafter, so we were ready for lunch.  \\n\\nWaitstaff was friendly and efficient.  Drinks were kept filled.  A basket of tasty warm bread was brought to the table.  My order of a small white pizza came out (their small is pretty darn big - it's a 6 slice pizza, about the size of a chain restaurant's medium), and it was a thin crust white pizza, just as ordered.  The cheese had a good flavor to it.  The pizza is a thinner crust that I would have preferred to be a bit crisper, but it was fine.  My lunch date got a pasta dish that came out steaming hot, she had no complaints.  And her toddler nibbled on a little bit of a cheese pizza (no kids menu?).\\n\\nIt was a good lunch.  My total for the small white pizza and a soda came out to a little less than $11.  I work down Tyvola and was able to get there, eat lunch and be back at work in an hour-ish, so it was a good workday spot for me.  Friendly staff, solid food. My rating for this place is",

They offer a great variety of vegetarian options and the food tastes different than anywhere else -  truly unique.  I remember the salad and their homemade house dressing even being so good, that I would purchase a container of it to go.  They also give you this flatbread with your meal and I love dipping it in everything - the dressing, the hummus, and the sauces from the entrees.  And you can buy a whole flatbread to go, which makes for an awesome pizza crust!\\n  \\nMy recent visits to Kabul have been good, but something has changed since 1996-2001.  The salad used to be quite a bit larger, have cherry tomatoes, purple cabbage, carrot strips and the curry dressing was fluffy and rich.  Now the dressing seems watered down and the tomatoes are sliced and very cold (don't put your tomato's in the fridge or freezer!!!).  The hummus used to be outstanding and now it is a hit or miss (sometimes being very granular).  The entrees are still very good and I would love to visit this restaurant more often.  It's not terribly expensive either.  But I wonder if it's under new ownership or they've changed the cooks... or are they getting lazy? Cutting corners?\\n\\nI don't eat the meat soup (Mashawa), but my parents who would visit me while in school did.  My mom loved it so much that she had to try and make it at home.  Went to Kabul about 4 times in 2011... recommended the soup to my meat eating friend the last time I was there and it looked extremely watered down.  Nothing like the way it did 10 years ago.\\n\\nPlease Kabul!!! Don't lose your integrity!  Return to the upstanding quality that was once something to really really brag about (******) and recommend to everyone.  I will still crave this restaurant until the day I die.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nI absolutely love Capriotti's. I get the Capastrami everytime I come, it's simply delicious. That mountain of meat, cheese, dressing, and slaw. Oh and don't let me forget they have 20 inch subs. Yes that's 20 inches of deliciousness. Now overall I would give all other Capriotti's locations a 5 stars no question about it but I have had nothing but problems with THIS LOCATION the three times I have been here. The problems I have had everytime has been either with delivery or calling in my order for pickup.\\n\\nFirst experience: I found out they delivered so I ordered a 20 inch Capastrami with some other items for delivery to my apartment via their app at 6pm. The app said it would take about an hour and a half to get there, extremely long. I called the store out of curiosity about 20 minutes after placing my order just to verify everything. I get told they are not currently delivering as no one there owns a car, they deliver only from 12-4pm, and they did not recieve my order period. So why did the app let me order? That's an error on the owners behalf. If I didn't call the food would of never shown up without any notice. Seems like amatuer work to me. So I drive to the store and get my food. I arrive home and there is a delivery guy knocking on my door. Amatuer work at it's finest and terrible communication.\\n\\nSecond experience: I was at work and decided I would buy lunch for me and my partner as he has never had Capriotti's. I call and order a 20 inch Capastrami once again. The woman on the phone tells me I have to order over $30 for delivery. I don't know anywhere else that requires that much for a minimum. I tell her I didn't order $30 worth of items last week and got delivery to my apartment. She told me they don't deliver to apartments and basically called me a liar with her bitchy attitude. I asked to speak to her manager. A split second later she is back trying to disguise her voice. There is no professionalism with this staff. I hung up to prevent myself from saying some evil shit.\\n\\nThird experience:...\n\nStars:",

I sadly didn't get to try it until I got to work and by then it was cold but still delicious. It was so good I went back this morning and ordered it again! This time I ate it on my way to work. So yummy when it's warm and toasty! I will probably be back tomorrow and will try to make myself try something new. There are a lot of options! \\n\\nWhile I am in love with the bagel, the coffee was just meh. One review on here mentions that the mocha is better than Starbucks. I would have to disagree. Tried the latte today and was also not impressed. I like my coffee to be more on the sweet side though.\\n\\nAlso the older woman who is mentioned in another review is just as you described: short with words and grumpy. It's kind of a turn off but when the bagel is that good I will put up with it! \\n\\nI don't like the debit card machine and the place to tip.

        "Review: I decided to use City Wide because of their lower price.  Well I should have known better.  I was using another company for my pest control but thought I would give it a chance since I was trying to save a little cash.  One night inside my house, I almost stepped on a scorpion and I never had problems with scorpions with the other company.  Two days later, I found yet another scorpion in my house. I called City Wide the next day and told them I found two scorpions in my house.  The customer rep was extremely rude and condescending with me.  She told me I could up my coverage but it would cost a lot more.  Also, they would charge me another $25 fee on top of my monthly charge since they had just been out to my house to spray.  I DO NOT recommend City Wide and would suggest to seek other companies unless you want bugs, critters and scorpions living with you in your house.  Because City Wide was not spraying the right stuff, I'm now behind the eight ball and dealing with a pest issue!!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: More like 2.5 stars. \\n\\nThis place is kind of a clusterfuck.  The evening classes are always PACKED, so you have to go early to sign up outside which is more difficult and confusing than it should be. \\n\\nMost of the classes are taught by the owner - and I don't think she is a very good yoga instructor.  She is more of an aerobics/fitness instructor - she wants you to feel the burn, push yourself to your limits and plays loud pop music during class.  The instructor who does the Tuesday/Thursday evening classes is much better and yoga-ish, its more relaxing while still getting in a good sweaty session.  I always feel so good when it is over! \\n\\nSomething about this place that really skeeves me out: Towards the end of class, before relaxation, the instructor (and 2 volunteers) come around and give EVERY person a little back and foot massage.  That would feel nice if this were a normal yoga class, but considering how much everyone is sweating, its kinda gross.  I don't know if that is normal for hot yoga classes, but its unsanitary... \\n\\nSometimes the owner locks her dog up inside her car while she is in class, which I think is mean.  I hope she doesn't do that in the summer time.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I am vegetarian and my husband is a little picky, and as such I made asked for some substitutions to our order.

        "Review: We came here to celebrate my college graduation. I looked at TripAdvisor for a Italian restaurant good for kids and for special celebrations. That lead me to Mama's. However..... obviously people reviewing here and giving 5 stars don't know about Italian culinary. The restaurant menu includes a briefing about the owner's family and history. They can indeed be Italians but they have managed to create a menu based upon what us Americans think about Italian food (pasta sauces and breads with loads of garlic on it and lasagna with ricotta cheese on it). Just take as an example Olive Garden.... and I am not comparing Mama's to Olive Garden as the food here is much better, but in terms of laying down the american vision and taste for Italian food.\\n\\nIf there is an authentic Italian restaurant in Charlotte that is the Luce Ristorante in Uptown and also Dolce Ristorante. \\n\\nThis restaurant has a decent quality of food, the service is great, but quite honestly, I have tasted better pasta than this one at Hawthorne Pizza Bar in Huntersville.\\n\\nThe Nutella pie that everyone claims to be \\\"delicious\\\" does not taste like Nutella at all. It tastes like Peanut Butter cheese cake. I even asked the server if she had made a mistake and brought the wrong dessert and she said that it was the correct one. We then said: It tastes like Peanut Butter and she replied: Really? But doesn't Nutella tastes like Peanut Butter to you??? That response made me think that clearly that the restaurant may not even know what they are cooking.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

As well there are tip jars all over the place.\\n\\nWe purchased their multi-pack which gave us tickets for the train ride, mystery shack and mine tour. I think it saved us $3-5 on an adult admission (I seem to think it was $16/adult). We purchased our pack at the train station, where there are also public washrooms available. There are some in town but seem to be lined up ALL the time.\\n\\nWe boarded the train for a tour around the city, which I highly recommend doing first. It gives you a little bit of an idea of what is all in Goldfield and an entertaining ride (if you get a good conductor). I believe the train ride takes 20-30 minutes in total. \\n\\nWe then went to the mine tour, which was excellent. Our guide was very, very entertaining. He did make one little girl scared of the elevator ride (other children were fine), however as someone with no children present I found him very entertaining. The mine tour itself is excellent, it gives you an idea of what went on in the mines and our guide put it over the top. He was very entertaining and humourous throughout the whole tour. The only complaint I have is that they take down a large group and if you want to take pictures of something you need to be at the front of the line or else the lights might be turned off before you get a chance (they are turned on in sections and as you are leaving the section turned off).\\n\\nWe then went to the Mystery Shack. We soon learned the extent of how poorly things are run. You can only have 12 people in at a time (they sometimes allow more, our guide told us whoever could stand on the concrete pad at the far left would get in) and there is no system in place to indicate who was waiting the longest. I would highly recommend sitting close to that concrete pad. We waited, and found out in 10 minutes...\n\nReview rating:",

        "Went for dinner.  Started with lobster bisque - excellent and calamari with peppers - also good; husband said the peppers were how his grandmother used to make them in a crock.  I had the scallops and gnocchi.  The scallops were nice and tender but the gnocchi while good, is more like an oblong potato pancake.  Obviously I was disappointed since it was not the traditional Italian gnocchi.  Husband didn't like the parmesan crusted shrimp with spaghetti.  He ate the spaghetti but not the shrimp.  I personally didn't think the shrimp was that bad even though I have had better.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "When I called around for a yard clean-up, most of the prices were about the same so I chose Sergio's because they could come out fast.  The 3 person team arrived early this morning and before they began I inquired as to how long it would take them and if they knew what the approx. charge would be.  There was a lot of communication issues but finally the one said $95/hour.  I just let it drop as we were getting nowhere.  35 minutes after they started they rang the bell to tell me they were finished.  I asked how much and I was told $95.  I said for 35 minutes of work??  and he shook his head yes.  It would have been nice to be told that there was a MINIMUM CHARGE.  They have lost a repeat client.  There were others that had flat fees and they were less than the $95 charge!  If you use these guys make sure that the owner comes out (as I expected him to be but was not) so that there will not be a language problem or you'll be ripped off too. My rating for this place is",

I was skeptical. \\n\\nI walked in and was greeted promptly and I sat at the bar, as I was dining alone.  Was served chips, salsa and bean dip, complimentary.   Both were great!\\n\\nFood was really good.  Service was amazing.  Dominic, the manager, personally introduced himself to me and made sure I was satisfied.  Hillary the bartender took good care of me since I was dining alone. She made sure that I got plenty of attention, and took her time to explain some of their dishes to me.\\n\\nI had the enchiladas and they were amazing.  The house margarita is 24 ounces and only $6!  Very tasty and hit the spot to cool off my mouth from the spicy sauce on my enchiladas.  \\n\\nI would bring friends and family here anytime.  Pork green chili is soooo good!!! Yum!!!\\n\\nI recommend giving it a try.  Sounds like they are under new management and I am literally shocked at the difference I experienced vs the previous reviews.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nLet me start by saying, I have not had a problem with the staff. I have seen Dr. Deem and really liked him. He is very down to earth, understanding, knowledgeable, and comforting. I would highly recommend him as a primary care provider. I have also seen a few nurse practioners here in other departments that I have liked. Unfortunately, my biggest problem is with billing. What I have learned by working in the health field is that most people do not understand billing and health insurance and therefore often times get overcharged. I have only been to Christie Clinic a few times, but I seem to have a billing issue every time I go.  My first appointment I had was a preventative annual physical which should be billed as such in order to have the appointment paid at 100%. There also should not be a co-pay for preventative physicals according to my insurance. However, instead of billing it as an annual physical, Christie Clinic seems to only bill as medical office visits. There is a big difference between the two especially when it comes to payment. I have tried to call to resolve this problem, and all they told me is  \\\"you probably said something during the visit that made it an office visit instead of a physical.\\\" Something I said? Really? Even the labs that the doctor ordered for me were labeled as \\\"preventative screening.\\\" Even when the doctor entered the room, he said \\\"You're here for an annual physical right?\\\" Yet, apparently I \\\"must have\\\" said the wrong thing during that visit. \\n\\nThe other separate issue I had is I went in for an annual pap smear last year. Which was also supposed to be paid 100% because it is preventative screening. Well first of all, the doctor billed the reading of the specimen on a separate day from the actual visit. Therefore, (according to my insurance) it looked as if I made two visits in the same week and therefore my insurance only paid for the first date that they used for billing. If they were billed on the same day like they should have been, I would not have had a bill....\n\nStars:",

        "I bought a house about a year ago, and unfortunately did not completely realize what I was getting myself into. My a/c is old and neglected. Needless to say we have had several issues with it in this short year and have had several different companies come out to check and help with the numerous breakdowns we have had. Of all the companies that have come out Shamrock has really stood out above the rest. \\n\\nEvery one recommends that we buy a new a/c, and frankly that is not an option right now, so we just need to do what we can to keep the current one running. Our first call out to Shamrock was at the beginning of July, right in the thick of our 110+ degree weather. They were able to get to us within 24hours, which was better than most other overbooked companies. When their technician arrived he was very friendly and polite, took time to listen to my explanation of the problem then went to see for himself. After careful review he let me know he had to go get a new part and to my HUGE relief, was going to be able to fix the problem that day. After a couple of hours of work he knocked on my door and brought me the piece that he removed/replaced and explained what it was and how it broke. I was surprised he took the time to explain, especially because I am a female - all other male technicians I had experienced with other companies treated me as though I would never understand so all I needed to know was whether the problem ws fixed or not. He then went on to give me recommendations on how to keep my unit running more effeciently and suggested maintenance options. Of course this was his selling point but I respectfully declined, and instead of the uncomfortable awkwardness you usually get when trying to get rid of a \\\"salesman\\\" IN your house, he acknowledged my choice and was polite when leaving. \\n\\nWithin two weeks another piece failed, I called Shamrock again and they fixed within 24hours and I was not charged the service fee because it was reported within such a short time of my initial call. I ultimately... My rating for this place is",

Well, I'm not a pizza expert, nor have I ever tried Detroit style pizza before, I just love me some good pizza. \\n\\nAnd that is why this review is \\\"A-OK\\\".  There was just way too much crust for the amount of toppings in the \\\"Sky Masterson (pepperoni, ham, sausage, and meatballs) and \\\"Nicely Nicely's\\\" (chicken, garlic, and mushroom) for my liking.  Thank God the ranch dressing was delicious, because that was the only way that I was able to eat the leftover crust once my toppings were devoured.  If you like thick crust- then you'll love Northside Nathan's.  \\n\\nWe also ordered the chicken wings and those alone have me intrigued to come back.

        "Just recovered from another fun First Friday at the Arts Factory. \\n\\nHad some friends in town and brought them through the Arts Factory to show them a good time hitting First Friday. \\n\\nI like to start at the southern part of First Friday near the Stratosphere and work my way up past the music stages, locals artists, beef jerky stands and organic food trucks through the chaos and sea of punks, hipsters, goths, emos, gangsters, hippies and granolas. (I'm a big people watcher!) \\n\\nI like to stop at Artifice for a Stella, then with my plastic cup in hand, head over to The Arts Factory to see what's new!\\n\\nI love how the spaces are dynamic and changing every time that I visit for a First Friday! I have so much fun! I'm originally from Seattle and we have a 1st Thursday, ut its much more spread out (and rainy) in Seattle, so we always end up staying in the same building. \\n\\nI love exploring all the nooks and crannies and finding new artists posted up. I love walking though the Graffiti/Japanese inspired doll stores, checking out the new stencil art, wandering outside to listen to some live jams, and check out all the cool tents with always different artists hocking their wares. I really enjoy the diversity of people, and the uber-relaxed ability to drink on the go and have a good time in general. I'm never bored and almost never end up where I think I'm going to. \\n\\nI like how the other building involved are just a stone's throw away. The drink prices are about the same as a bar, and in some cases in teeny tiny plastic cups not worth the price. Some of the food is expensive so make sure to bring some cash with you for those spur of the moment purchases. \\n\\nI spent a lot of time dancing in the Captial Arts Center to the DJ spinning Electro, a lot of the night, donating to the donation Champagne (that gave me heartburn), but definitely had a blast as always, and my friends get a taster of non-strip Vegas. I almost try to sway my friends into coming the weekends of first Fridays just so I have more excuse to...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

It was far from what I expected for a family vacation. The website made it appear much more GRAND than it really is.\\n\\nThe rooms are outdated and dirty. We got a king suite and the size was OK except the bathroom. It was very small and all the fixtures felt cheap. The air conditioner was turned to 61 but the room didn't get below 78 degrees the whole time we were there. We were traveling with our 2 girls and the plan was to have them sleep on the pullout couch in the living area of the suite. First, when you pull out the sofa it obliterates all living space. To get out of the room we had to climb over the coffee table. ( I considered putting it outside the room, that's how difficult it was to move around.) When the girls went to lay on the sofa bed it was actually painful. The mattress is all springs with no mattress left. It's obviously old and the resort is obviously aware of this. When we called to say that the bed was unacceptable they brought a couple of pieces of foam which succeeded in covering the springs but made for a very hard surface. Luckily the hard surface was a moderately acceptable solution as it was the only one the hotel had, other than paying hundreds more for a Villa. The king bed in the bedroom was old and tired too. \\n\\nThe general building and grounds are TIRED!!! I opened my french doors onto the \\\"deck\\\" and couldn't even step out there it was so covered in something undefinable. Clearly, this area does not get cleaned or maintained at all. Some of the areas appear to have been updated recently but those are few and far between. For the most part, the grounds were dank and dreary. \\n\\nHousekeeping must be overworked.

        "Could be the waitress I've had the last two times I've been here, but my general feeling is that this place is rarely worth the money. We went for dinner after a Spring Training game and our waitress had difficulty splitting a bill in half (she hand wrote the totals on the original receipts..?). Service was slow but it was late and we had drinks and a group so it wasn't an issue so much. Food was meh.\\n\\nThen I go in for lunch today, same waitress. I think \\\"oh great, this should be an adventure\\\" -- boy was I right. Took over an hour for 2 lunch portions and an appetizer for our table. Nothing complex, either (2 fish and chips and a baked artichoke). It seemed that the waitress had no concept of time -- likely because she was standing at the bar just inside talking to her coworkers while we burned up on the patio waiting for food. She also failed to bring out condiments we asked for -- I would have reminded her, but the next time we saw her, she was bringing the checks.\\n\\nI may not have cared so much if I wasn't on a lunch break, but when it's business lunch hour, you'd think the waitstaff would try to acknowledge that. $20 for lunch with slow service and average food is never worth it.\\n\\nHonestly don't think I'll be returning unless it's for cheesecake to go, which seems to be the only considerate service in the place.

        "Review: I have mixed feelings about this place.  I'll say up front: I only ever go there on Sundays for football, and I would never go there for any other reason.  It is the only bar I know of in the city where you can reliably find every NFL game televised and enjoy your Sunday if you're not a Steelers fan.  Pretty much every team is represented by the crowd on Sundays, with a disproportional number of Bills and Redskins fans.  The crowd is generally friendly, with many of the same faces from week to week.\\n\\nThey tend to have a wide selection of beers that rotates pretty regularly, but wide selection doesn't always mean good selection.  That said, sometimes they get some really great beers that you wouldn't expect to find at a sports bar.  Whatever you do, don't order a bloody Mary, they're atrociously bad.  The staff is almost universally friendly, with the exception of one barback who seems to always be in a bad mood and rude to customers (he often takes over as bartender later in the day on Sundays).  That said, the wait staff don't seem to know much about the food or beers that are offered, often mis-characterizing new beers that are on tap or giving wrong information about things on the menu.\\n\\nThe food is mediocre and over-priced.  When two of us go for one game on a Sunday, drink 3-4 beers each and each order an entr\\u00e9e, we generally end up with a tab in the $80-90 range, depending on what we're drinking that day.  In a city that is almost universally accommodating to vegetarians, this place is most decidedly not.  They have a veggie burger which is actually pretty good, but it's the only decent thing on the menu for a vegetarian to eat (there is also a grilled cheese sandwich and a veggie sandwich, both of which are bland to the point of tasteless.  It's like eating plain bread).  They have 4 entr\\u00e9e salads, and every one of them has meat as a defining ingredient.  They don't even have beans so you could have decent veggie nachos.  I know, it's a sports bar, but I don't want to eat the same veggie...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Still, somehow I think I love you more every year, which is why I'm willing to wait on a week night, or any night for that matter.

(I have been to all of them minus Flagstaff and PV Mall area.) The cheerleaders also known as servers there are always friendly, smiling and fast. I only have two suggestions for this location and others:\\n\\n1) Salads and main courses should never arrive together unless specified by the guest. Sometimes I forget to tell my server I want my salad first and my food gets cold. Mutl-tasking isn't something that should be involved when dining, we want to savor the moment and the delicious food. Let's fix this!\\n\\n2) The Gorgonzola vinaigrette was the best thing that happened to Oregano's since the old-school raspberry vinaigrette took off.

It wasn't spiced as much as I thought it would be. Maybe they were hoping the sauce that was in it would make up for the bland spicing.  The sauce had a small bit of kick and was all right. The carnitas tacos were a bit of a let down...the meat was dry, but the salsa was all right.\\n\\nIf you're looking for fast and easy, this is it.

        "I've been to this shop on four occasions now over the past 3 years. Overall, I like the shop. They seem honest and the repairs they've done on my car (replacing a water pump & thermostat) have been handled well and I didn't have additional problems. They ain't cheap though, that's for sure! $350 for water pump replacement and $500 to replace my thermostat and radiator hoses. And that's for a Chevy. \\n\\nI like that they offer free transport from their shop back to your home. 2 of the 3 times my car was in their shop, they did call me later in the day to tell me the status of my car, and my car was fixed by the end of the day all 3 occasions. They did forget to do an oil change one time when I asked them to do this while my car was in the shop for the water pump replacement and there was another occasion where I asked them to install a tail pipe on my car which at first they said they could do, but then later called me and said they couldn't do after I had dropped the car off and left to return to my home. That cost me a taxi ride and about 2 hours of my Saturday morning for nothing. \\n\\nBut as I said overall I like the shop. Prices are a bit high, but the quality seems good. \\n\\nLast updated May, 2011 My rating for this place is",

The 80s section of the place has the most unique group of people. It was quite entertaining...I couldn't decide whether to hold back and just watch or to let loose and join the rest! But I really did enjoy the atmosphere...no shame in your dance moves here. The country theme section...wasn't necessarily country music...it was a little odd. Then there is the typical room that I'm used to where they play like the current dance club songs. My favorite was definitely the 80s section and I wouldn't mind coming back here again.\\nThere is a cover charge like 8 bucks I think...no biggie.

It's always me, my significant other and a single friend with whom we share our holiday eve with. We sat in the bar; the service was phenomenal. We thought the bill was pricey even with a $25 gift card, but we were cool with it. \\n\\nWe all shared the Calamari which was wonderful. My SO and I shared the filet/lobster tail entree, both of which were not very tasty. The lobster tail was so bland and came without butter. Our friend enjoyed his ribeye. We shared two vegetable sides, mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes. The shrooms were average and the mashed potatoes were flavorless.\\n\\nComing away, we feel as if the quality/flavor of the food has really declined since our last visit and I felt a need to leave this message here.\\n\\nWe love our neighborhood spot and our holiday tradition, but not sure if we'll change it up next year or not.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "We visited this Flancer's thanks to a Groupon that we purchased.  Heard mixed reviews and decided to try it anyways.\\n\\nThe layout of the location is too stuffy and even though we visited during the day there was not sufficient light.  Seated next to the area that had a stand with dirty dishes was not very appealing either.  Having grown up in the restaurant industry, it does not take much to take the used plates etc.. directly into the kitchen rather than it being in view for the customers in the dining area Its not appealing at all.\\n\\nThe service was super good, super efficient and super friendly and that is the best part of our experience.  \\n\\nHeard good things about their sandwiches and it did not disappoint.  The Braised the Lord Beef and the Philly Cheese steak were good, but at over $10 each with the extras it was certainly pricey for a very casual dining place.  The sides of Jalapeno & Cheddar Mashed Potato Pie and the Macaroni & Cheese were both great options.\\n\\nIn summary, great service, good food but pricey, but awful layout and setup of the restaurant. The ambiance is as important as the food, and even the food was good, the dreary & non uplifting ambiance took all of the flavor of the food away.\\n\\nNot sure if we will be back, even with a GroupOn as there are so many other choices.\nSo I would like to give it",

It's nice to get meal off the strip away from the casinos and thousands of travelers. The 10 minute drive from the strip is worth it- trust me.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Now, I like happy hour as much as the next person, probably more, but sometimes I am just not in the mood for loud music, surrounded by a bunch of beautiful people, in a trendy setting. When I'm looking for something a little more reserved and I want good sushi, I go to Sakana.\\n\\nThe portions are VERY generous, the atmosphere is quiet and cozy, the staff is happy and friendly and the focus is on good food, not a cool image. \\n\\nWhile it appears they don't have a \\\"happy hour\\\" at Sakana, they do have a special \\\"Customer Appreciation\\\" menu (Mon-Thur) with discounted prices on the most popular rolls. Plus, last night when we went, there was a special of \\\"order a Kirin or Kirin Light and get an appetizer for 50 cents.\\\" What a deal!\\n\\nAlso, this is a great place to go with a group because of the Teppanyaki Grill tables, and that is always a fun time! Sakana is one of Ahwatukee's best kept secrets for true sushi lovers!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "We are new to Charlotte and two Sundays ago wanted to find a good place to watch football. We stumbled upon East Blvd Bar and Grill. We had an amazing female bartender that was all smiles and very personable. She happily put a game we wanted on a side TV for us and talked to us throughout the afternoon. I watched her make bloody mary after bloody mary, answer the phone, and manage to socialize with her customers. She was the epitome of a good bartender. The food was great, as well. This morning we both had wings and football on the brain and East Blvd is where we wanted to go. It wasn't busy when we walked in, 30 mins prior the game. The bartender didn't even greet us, but merely set a menu in front of us and said, \\\"What can I get you?\\\" Sure, I guess everyone isn't as personable as the last...but he just seemed as if everyone was a nuisance and an inconvenience. He acted as if he was swamped, and when we asked for a game on a side tv, he coldly said it would be a bit. At one point, a customer was joking about the phones ringing off the hook, and he fired back \\\" Would you rather I answer the phone or pour your beer?\\\" Never cracked a smile, couldn't even muster a \\\"you're welcome\\\" following a customer's thank you...I mean, why be a bartender? Every single patron at the bar noticed his poor attitude. I am not writing this with the intention of trying to get anyone fired, and I have only ever written a review on yelp one other time, and it was a good one. But come on! The energy at a bar on football Sunday should be high. I shouldn't feel afraid to ask a question about the menu. On the contrary, he was attentive and I always had a drink in front of me. But personality as a bartender is a key quality. This gentleman did not display this quality in the least. I truly hope he was just having a bad day because we enjoy that location very much, however I can think of plenty of other places with nicer bartenders.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

But I gotta say, I've been here twice - with a good enough span of time in between both times, and I've been disappointed twice now. Actually, I attempted a third time in between the two different instances and was turned away - never have I been turned away by a small business. This was close to closing time, but still before, and though normally I would not want to keep people, I figured a small business such as JP Pancake could use the patronage.\\n\\nAt any rate - the last time I went, I ordered french toast - and what I got, I could have made better myself at home. Two tiny, flat pieces of toast, with hardly any flavor and forget presentation. Service was poor as the people waiting and cooking were unattentive and slow - not just to us but in terms of cleaning the tables of patrons who had already left. We walked in and it was litterally, find a table that wasn't strewn with dirty plates and glasses. It was not a pleasant site. And, just as we had been turned away the previous time we had attempted to visit this establishment, we watched them turn away an elderly man about 15 minutes to close.\\n\\nIt was just a bummer - I'm not sure who enjoys this place when literally right down the street is a fantastic breakfast place over and Hayden and Via de Ventura.\\n\\nTo break it down, I would not visit them again. They were:\\n- rude\\n- unattentive\\n- slow\\n- messy/dirty\\n- poor tasting food\\n- poor presentation\n\nReview rating:",

Eventhough the service was quick, it was very unfriendly, I guess that's the price you have to pay for quick service. Another thing, they are not kid friendly. If you have kids under the age of 15 years old, do not take them there. My 1 year old was playing with chopsticks and dropped them on the floor, the lady cleaning of the tables, picked them up and ran away with them, never to be seen again. She never brought us another pair of chopsticks to replace the ones she took. Of course, we didn't need them, my wife was using a fork and I was using my chopsticks. I think they didn't like my kid playing with the chopsticks, so that may be why they took them away and didn't bring us an extra pair. \\nIn conclusion, I would eat there again, but only carry out. I will never sit there and eat. There is too many other restaurants out there, to have to settle on such an unfriendly place.\n\nReview rating:",

Easy solution, I thought. Drive a little farther to the drive-thru Dairy Queen. YES!!!  \\n\\nCentral was eerily vacant of cars, so I made it there in no time. It took a while for someone to take my order and then when I got up to the window, this young kid looked at me and asked if I was \\\"so and so.\\\" At first I thought I didn't hear him right so I said, \\\"What?\\\" He repeated the name. I ponder it for a moment, and with a scrunched look, I said \\\"Uh, no.\\\" \\n\\nI paid, got my change and drove off.  But I started thinking on the way home: could that have been a secret code? For a drug-deal? Or some cool rave party? Damn! I should have said \\\"YES!\\\" I could've had some extra fun with my Parfait!  Oh, well.  It hit the spot.

If you are more than a party of two, be prepared to be cramped!  And if you are a party of two, you might find yourself in a hallway.  If you are looking for a refill on your soft drink, be prepared to pay for it as it is served in cans for which you will be charged 2.25 per can!  If you decide to share a plate with someone (including a child), be prepared to pay $2.00 for the extra plate.  If the server asks if you'd like bread, be prepared to pay for it.  If she brings you more, know that it will be on your bill.  You WILL be nickeled and dimed to death on top of the $15-$18 per plate that you spend on a relatively small portion size on most dishes.\n\nStars:",

The kids were hungry, and we weren't into the whole St. Patrick's Day mood. \\n\\nWe hadn't had Italian food in a while, so I navigated to this place via Yelp on the iPhone. It's in a professional building, underneath a dentist's office, adjacent to a bunch of strip malls on Gold Hill Road. \\n\\nWe found it odd that it was cold in the restaurant, on what was otherwise a very warm March 17.  The waitress offered to let us sit outside, and so we did. Never mind the bird poop on the wrought iron table... Or the fact that the patio hadn't been swept in a while. \\n\\nWe were promptly served the highlight of the meal, a basket of probably the best garlic knots I've ever tasted, complete with herbed butter. My boys demanded we get a second basket with our meal. \\n\\nI'm always suspicious of Italian restaurants that don't have some decent coffee available. When asked, the waitress didn't even know if they did. \\\"That's okay, I'll drink water...\\\" \\n\\nOddly, some folks behind us were served great-smelling coffee about 20 minutes later. I wasn't offered, so I resisted ordering it.\\n\\nMy universal complaint about most mom and pop Italian restaurants from NY to FLA to CA  is that they don't seem to do salads much justice, and they charge too much for them when they're ordered a' la carte. This place was no exception. \\n\\nWe found it interesting that the salad Twin B received as an accompaniment to his meal had a nice array of romaine and other lettuces on it, along with croutons, while my wife and I had to endure the non-nutritional value of iceberg and a sparse sampling of veggies. Twin A had ordered a special salad to go with his pizza. It came with great olives and just a few more veggies. \\n\\nI ordered a crab-stuffed sole, which came with broccoli and mashed potatoes.

I suggested Korean food for a date one night.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Was fine,very casual nothing to write home about american family resturant style. I had REALLY hoped for table top cooking because I think it is just more fun that way. makes things more festive. I also like a bit more traditional korean decor.\\n\\nService: I had a Teenage Korean American girl who spoke perfect english and was polite but not very attentive. She looked like she hated her after school job.\\n\\nFood: It was good but not great. We both ordered Bulgogi Which came in HUGE piles on sizzling plates witha layer of White onion underneath.the flavor was good but it was bit dry. The Side dishes were excllentt, I loved the Kimchee(the white radish and cabbage),potatoes and the sprout salad. Yummy.\\n\\nWine: First time I had korean wine at all. We chose the rice wine that came in a wooden bown. We both loved this. My date is Indian and they have a regional drink that is identical he was so excited when he realized. It was sweet mild and I really liked it\\n\\nOverall, I liked the place and would definitely go back.\\nWe are trying a new Korean Place tonight so I am interested to see how they match up.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Never. Again.\\n\\nI'm a teacher, and right now CCSD is wrapping up its first week of school. One week ago (Thursday, the 21st), I sent in an online order for four custom posters I'd designed for my classroom, using OfficeMax's ImPress service. I promptly received a confirmation email notifying me that they would be done at the *latest* by Tuesday, the 26th, at 10 a.m. \\n\\nThat was the second day of school. Naturally, I'd have hoped to have these done by the first, but it was my fault for not putting in the order sooner. So Tuesday rolls around and I'm waiting for the email/phone call telling me my order is ready so that I can duck out during my prep to pick the posters up. No call, no email.\\n\\nOn Wednesday morning (yesterday), I called the store and asked about my order. I was put on hold for about five minutes only to be told that my order was never put in. However, the rep I spoke to was very apologetic and assured me that my posters would be ready by the time I got out of work at 3. I had a meeting shortly after work, but I figured I'd have time to pick up/pay for the posters and still make it there. That was a mistake.\\n\\nWhen I got to the print services counter, I was ignored by the three staff members working behind it until a store manager approached and not-so-subtly hinted to the other workers that one of them should help me. My order was collected and . . . it was wrong. One of the four designs was missing and instead a different design had been printed twice. I was told that a different employee could help look up my order on the computer, but after she helped three different customers before me, I said I'd have to leave and come back. All told, I spent about 25 minutes waiting to be helped and left empty-handed.\\n\\nAfter my meeting, I drove back to the store and was promptly told that the computer had crashed and my order could not be retrieved. I was promised that my order would be ready to pick up today. Not feeling terribly optimistic, I called after work this afternoon and was cheerily told... My rating for this place is",

After about 200 miles away from home, my Hyundai Santa Fe experienced problems so I had it towed to the nearest Hyundai dealer, O'Brien Hyundai in Urbana, IL. \\n\\nWe left the Santa Fe there and rented a car to continue our trip. The service department and I were in constant contact during that weekend hoping to have work completed, or at least a complete analysis of the problem, by my Monday evening return to Illinois. \\n\\nO'Brien Hyundai informed us that they had no loaner cars even though they are an Auto Park with 12 auto brands and dealerships in nine cities. The link labeled \\\"The Journey\\\" of their website boasts:\\n\\n\\\"O'Brien Automotive Team locations are in nine cities and four states and include Peoria, IL (2 locations); Normal, IL, Urbana, IL, Champaign, IL; North Pekin, IL; Ft.

Automotive brands include Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, Scion, Jeep, Volkswagen, Dodge, Chrysler, Subaru, Chevrolet, and Mazda.\\\" (www.obrienteam.com)\\n\\nHow can you have this many dealerships and and not offer loaner cars? \\n\\nThe work that needed to be completed was covered by my warranty. It took from February 5, 2010 to March 1, 2010 for the service to be completed. They kept trying to find additional stuff they could fix and charge me for, and when I gave them the go ahead to fix it, they would break something else and tell me it would take an additional week to correct. \\n\\nThe total car rental cost was $1,018.80. If I'd known the service would take as long as it did, I would've had the vehicle towed to my preferred dealer near my home where I would've been offered a loaner and not have to make a 2.5 drive to pick up my car.\\n\\nI really would like to hope that in this day and age my ethnicity had nothing to do with why I wasn't offered a loaner, but I was born and raised in Illinois so I know better.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: I like coming into this store.  It's clean and always has great selection and deals.  However, me and a friend of mine went late one night to shop and I ended up finding great deals.  So I spent about $50 that night.  I walked out and my friend asked what did I get.  Well I didn't have everything in the bags so I went back inside to get it from the cashier.  The first cashier or maybe she was a manager saw me and I told her I just walked out and noticed that I was missing items.  She basically accused me of not telling the truth, gave me a dirty look like I was a thief and really didn't want help.  So I made my way back to the cashier who also denied that she had the bag and again accused me of lying since I walked out.  I think they felt I would make a scene which I would've because I was telling the truth and plus they were going to be closing within 15 minutes and there was a line!  THEN giggling the cashier, she pulls the bag from the bottom shelf by her...she totally knew that she had it and she herself was lying. I have a feeling this isn't the first time they've tried this with people. So watch your bags!   And I've worked in retail, really lame employees and actions that night.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I was excited to try this restaurant out, especially after snagging a Groupon.  The restaurant is in a small mixed use building, which makes the parking situation very difficult.  However, after you get passed the chaotic parking, you will enter the restaurant quaint restaurant feeling like you have left the concrete jungle behind.  \\n\\nThe inside is kind of dated, but fitting for a french restaurant.  The tables and chairs are very old and provide a nice setting to have a meal.\\n\\nRight off the bat, however, the service was lousy.  And this by itself is why this place gets 3 stars.  I think it took a good 10 minutes for someone to come by and take our order.  The waiters are basically career waiters, they have been their forever and unfortunately are not very friendly.  I would much rather be served by a younger person in their 20's who can provide a not so snoody feeling for the dinner.  I have eaten at other french restaurants of higher caliber and the service is much better.\\n\\nThe food was very good though.  I had the rack of lamb.  A great choice and cooked exactly to my liking.  The desserts looked great, but nothing really jumped out at me as being have to have.  But even though we decided not to order the waiter brought out a selection of 3  mini creme brulees.  I guess that is common.  So for future reference I will not order the dessert and just bank on the free one.\\n\\nOverall, I wont return unless I have a groupon.  I feel there are better restaurants, and cheaper ones too.

The milk shake was taking long so I begin eating my room temp nuggets. I'm not the type of person to send back food if I don't find if hot enough so I suck it up and eat it and wait for my shake. About 7minutes later I send the boyfriend in to get my milkshake and they told him that they thought we drove off so it was just sitting there and they didn't even remake it.

What was very odd was that the waiter, who was the only staff member interacting with the customers, completely ignored not only my family and I when we entered (I was pushy and got a seat) but three more families that came in.  I saw him looking at them out of the corner of his eye but no verbal recognition at all so they all left.  It was quite odd.  The food was ok, I had a Western Omlette that was smallish and a little greasy.  The cooks in the backed seemed physically unkempt and wore no hair nets with longer hair.  Isn't that a rule?

        "I reserved a rental through Hotwire for a full-size car. When I arrived late at night to pick up my vehicle, the rental agent advised me they didn't have any more full-sized vehicles and that they'd give me a free upgrade. I am not picky, but the only vehicles she said they had were a minivan and an extra-large SUV. I knew I'd be driving a lot and I didn't want to have to pay lots of money to gas up the vehicle, so I asked if there was anything else available. Instead of offering me something smaller, she said, \\\"sorry, this is all that's left on the lot.\\\" \\nHaving worked in the rental business I knew she wasn't telling the truth. Sure enough, I stepped outside and saw several other vehicles she could have put me in, like a Cross-over or a mini-SUV. They had dozens available on their lot, but I am not sure if she just wasn't creative or if she was lazy, but there were other things she could have done to accommodate me. The vehicle was nice and in good shape, and she wasn't rude, but I expect a lot more in the way of customer service. Rent from somebody else if you have the choice.\nSo I would like to give it",

Never have I seen such a large ball of meat on a plate, just waiting to be divided up and partitioned to the dinner guests at the table. \\n\\nThe meatball and I, played a coy game of flirting back and forth, I tried a few other dishes first, the anti-pasto salad, Fresh green beans, the stuff shells, the lemon chicken, all which were very good. Then, the meatball decided to seduce me with it's sauce, and I wasn't able to resist. \\n\\nWas it the best meatball I've ever had in my life? No, (see my review of Pasto's) I even make a better meatball (turkey, bison, or beef, you take your pick) I just appreciate the sheer mass of meat they use, and their sauce was sweet and a bit tangy, just right for meat, terrible on pasta I would imagine.\\n\\nOverall this place has \\\"chain\\\" character, but is not authentic in anyway. The menu is so unhealthy it took some creative mixing of side dishes for me to even get close to a \\\"well balanced meal.\\\" However, for a fun family event, or evening with friends, I like the way this restaurant forces you to interact and share dishes with each other.  It makes the dinner experience more engaging than simply ordering your own dish and eating in a silo. \\n\\nIf I could I'd give the place 3.5 stars, I will let the Yelp aggregate my rating with the others, perhaps this place can climb to 3.5 stars someday.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

On top of that, the girl who did them drew blood from my cuticle when she used the filing machine too roughly. Then she put super-glue on there to stop the bleeding. To top it off, my acrylics are way too thick and they flatten out and go wide at the tips. I'm removing them myself since there is a risk of fungal infection once they've lifted.

A friend said we should try this place because it is a lot less crowded, which sounded nice because the open skate at the ice den can be chaotic and too crowded.  I should also say that I really wanted to like this place.  When we got there, it was not very clear where we pay for open skate and rent the skates.  We finally figured out that you have to go into the shop, so we went in and there was only one worker who was helping someone pick out skates, we had to wait a long time before she could ring us up to skate.  Then she didn't tell us where to go to get our skates, I had to ask her.  She pointed where to go, then she said she would be right there.  Is this a one-man operation??  So, again, we had to wait for her to come around.  The ice skates were in horrible condition, in my opinion, they seemed 30 years old!! We also rented some trainers for the kids.  (I couldn't believe we had to pay $5 each for them, they were made out of pvc pipe!!)\\nThe ice was incredibly choppy and was hard to skate on and the place was just kind of yucky.  The only good thing I can say about it is that there weren't a lot of people, but I can see why!  I really don't think it's any cheaper than the ice den, in fact, their trainers definitely cost more and are way less sturdy.

However, with that being said, this joint really isn't too shabby either.\\n\\nPho Kim Long (that name will never cease to get a chuckle out of me) is the go-to late night spot to get your drunk grub on. I've been here way too many times for my own good, as my state of sobriety while eating here is usually (although not always!) questionable. Regardless, the food is solid and the locals seem to love it.\\n\\nWhen I came to Vegas this past June for EDC (yep, as in the Electronic Daisy Carnival 2012 ---- suuuuch a crazy experience, btw), company preferred ordering family style dishes like shaking beef, ong choy, pork spare ribs etc. Everything was quite tasty and portions were ample, but I got the impression that this place catered more to American tastes. The dishes, while yummy in my tummy, were more like something you might find in a mainstream Chinese restaurant than authentic Viet food. Still, no real complaints as it was delicious nevertheless.\\n\\nDuring my last trip over Halloween weekend, though, I ordered more \\\"true\\\" Viet fare like seafood noodle soup and Bun Bo Hue. I was surprised that the taste and quality were above average. Definitely better than Tung Kee Noodlehouse and probably better than a good portion of pho spots back home! I can see why the locals took me here so often because if *I* was local, I'd probably become a regular too.\\n\\nHowever, here's the issue:\\n\\nNOT being a local, I'm on vacation. And should be eating Vegas-y thangs. Elsewhere. Thangs that are NOT pho. Since I can get plenty of it. Authentic, at that. At home.\\n\\nSo...... basically......\\n\\nEat it if you're a local, eat if you're drunk and broke, eat it if you want Viet food while in Vegas. Heck, I'd do the same. If none of these things apply, though? And you have a choice to eat something else? I would. Because dammit, it's called a vacation. Feed me fancy things. Because that's what I want.

We both had the chicken avocado club wraps which to be fair, were very good. After we finally got them. This was probably around 9 PM on a Wednesday. The place had a few dozen guests at best but the service was very, very slow. Had to wait a long time to get a couple glasses of soda and even longer for our sandwiches. The 50's singing waiters was just annoying to me. But I know that's their thing there so others may really like it. For dessert we split a banana malt which I have to say was super good.

        "Review text:\nI moved to Plaza Midwood a few months ago.  I eat out a lot.  I have eaten at the Diamond quite a few times and have found it to be a nice place with nice servers.  You kind of know not to have high expectations in a place like this but it is a funky neighborhood spot.  Today I was out and about with my dog.  He was really hot and I knew I needed to get him some water and out of the sun.  The patio was completely open at the Diamond with only one couple sitting outside.  I found a nice shady table with good people watching for my dog and I.  And then I waited, and I waited, and I waited.  Finally a server came out to check on the other table.  When she didn't acknowledge me I called to her, \\\"Ma'm...Ma'm?  Ma'm\\\"  She completely ignored me.  I asked the other couple if I was supposed to go in and ask to be seated.  They said, \\\"don't worry, she will come back out.\\\"  They actually gave me their menu.  Another 10 minutes went by.  I was just about to give up when a couple walked in with their little girl.  The mom went in while the dad and daughter sat at the table next to me.  A server came right out and took their order!  So I asked the girl, was I supposed to come in and ask to be seated?  She said well normally yes but she would have someone come out and help me.  A third server came and finally took my order.  I had probably been there 20 min.  By this time I really didn't feel like eating.  I ordered a dessert as I thought it would be rude to only have tea.  I left her a $20 bill for a $6 check to show my appreciation that she at least waited on me when the other two women would not.  I am a really nice person and I feel like I was treated shamefully.  Needless to say, the Diamond won't see any more of my business.  Which is really sad.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I looked it up and discovered they're open at 4 AM. I bugged the boyfriend and he came along for my donut run. They have a wide variety of vegan donuts. My favorites were the butterfly maple peanut and chocolate filled donuts. It was so good I devoured the donuts so quickly. I threw some of them away not because they were bad, but because they were too good. I was starting to feel guilty and had to work out after.

After ordering, everything came out pretty quickly. The food, I had the Steak Kabobs, was not hot. I would say lukewarm. I ordered the kid's Steak Bites for my son, and the meat was well cooked, but again, not hot. The rolls, which come when you get your table, were tasty. The special desert they gave my mom and brother was ice cream with Hershey's syrup. Not good. See, just not consistent!\nSo I would like to give it",

However the experience here was not very good!  \\n\\nI grew up eating most of the food on the menu, and I tend to make strong comparisons against that home cooking.  In addition, I love food, and I have a wide taste bud ranging from various regions of the world.\\n\\nThe food was delivered to me at my table very very very very very hot.

The previous day, my business colleague order and ate the red beans and rice.\\n\\nService was good.  The menu needs help.\\n\\n1) The Fried Chicken wasn't really fried.  It looked like baked chicken that was dried out.  Not crispy looking, not seasoned. Not very tasty.\\n2) The Catfish was a complete fish with bones.  The taste was pretty good! However, I would have enjoyed it more had I not had to de-bone every bite.\\n3) The Greens were good!\\n4) Yams were good!\\n5) Corn bread was just ok\\n6) Banana Pudding was very good!\\n7) Red beans rice and sausage was not good.\\n\\nAll and all, the Merts was just ok,  However, if in town again, I would not be compelled to re-visit...and I love Soul Food.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Driving home from the far northwest valley, I spotted the sign for Santisi Brothers from the freeway and told my husband what awesome pizza and oysters they had. \\n\\nI guess I should mention the last time I was at Santisi Brothers was about 9 years ago. Back then, they did have great raw oysters--huge and succulent. I don't know when they stopped serving them but I was very disappointed tonight because that's what I really wanted. \\n\\nI remembered the pizza as being right up there with some I've had back east. What we had tonight (the 10\\\" cheese pizza--which by the way is the best test of how good a pizza is if it can stand alone with no toppings) was only a step above Domino's to me. Maybe the thin crust is better but I didn't feel like spending an extra $4.00 to find out. \\n\\nThe one bright spot was the Philly Cheese steak. They got the steak, cheese and peppers just right. The roll was a little doughy to me but I have high expectations for a cheese steak since I grew up outside of Philly. \\n\\nThe service was good and if you are a sports fan, you can't ask for more games on more TVs. I could have done without the screaming Oklahoma fans a couple of tables away though. But it's a sports bar so I don't hold them accountable for the fans there. \\n\\nSantisi Brothers, if you read this, I am begging you to bring back the oysters. Maybe then the drive from the east side would be worth it. Otherwise I can find so-so bar food in my neck of the woods. My rating for this place is",

        "I have sat on this review for awhile... I really wanted to think it through. Like I said in my last review, Atlasta catered my wedding. I was pretty disappointed. Unlike what I had experienced previously with them, my wedding was a bit of a disaster. The person I had been working with throughout the process wasn't at the wedding.... so despite many many phone calls and e mails, things were not set up correctly. I felt totally ignored and like my time had been wasted. Unlike at my friend's wedding where they came to check with her and help her set up, no one came to check with me and I had to go looking for them (in my wedding dress!) to ask them to put something on the tables... people saw me before the ceremony... not cool. The food served was not the food discussed throughout the planning process. Items were missing sauces, salads that were supposed to be served as salad 'tacos' were served in a bowl. Our whole idea of small plates and stations was not pulled off due to their poor presentation and their disregard for what we had talked about previously. I didn't get to eat much, but what I ate was not at the level I had expected. We were supposed to have grilled cheese with tomato soup shots.... the tomato soup was missing for most of the night... the grilled cheese was cold and flavorless. I think the worst thing was that we spoke to them extensively about having to have vegan and vegetarian options for our guests that were labeled.... we had a vegetarian mac and cheese that was supposed to be served with bowls of toppings for the people to add themselves.... the mac and cheese was labeled vegetarian, but not only were there no bowls of toppings, but they put bacon in it!!!! This is unacceptable for my vegetarian guests.... Additionally, they forgot to put out a knife for us to cut the cake with... so we used a butter knife... nice. Anyway, there were many other disappointing aspects to this company, but I won't get into it. I would not recommend them for your special day...they certainly put a damper on mine.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "This was the 2nd time I've golfed at Dobson Ranch.  The first time we decided not to go back.  They cram too many people on the course, which just makes the day drag along.\\n\\nThis time the course wasn't busy but when we get there we find out that they are over-seeding so tee-boxes can't be used, and that the carts could not leave the path.  And to top it off, no cart girl on a day it was 98 degrees.\\n\\nWow, that would have been important information when the reservation was made a week or two prior.  I went in a group of 9 (a group of 2, 4, and 3) for some birthday golf, which is the only reason I came back to this place.  We had 2 seniors behind the group that called to complain so from early on we had rangers busting our balls. \\n\\n Rather than try to get us to enjoy their miserable course and conditions, they decided to make it even more obvious that a group spending $200 ($28per person for a round) on golf and another $100 at the bar/restaurant on a Tuesday was not worth their time.  They should have been throwing vouchers and coupons at us to come back and apologizing for the conditions and the lack of notice but they didn't do that.  This place lacks even mediocre customer service.  They cater to the guys golfing with a senior discount.  If you are looking to have any fun (ie talking, socializing, smiling) and not take your golf so serious, go elsewhere.\\n\\nMemo to Dobson Ranch.  If you want us to take our golf as serious as a professional, start treating customers professionally, and have a respectable course.  I would prefer any of the several muni's in the area that give you twice the value, and twice the service.\\n\\nIcing on the cake is that hole 1 and 10 are right next to the range.  There is no net to keep the multitude of range balls from littering the course.  Do they care?  No.  Literally every place we took a shot from, the sprinkler went on.  This happened to both groups.  We think they were doing it on purpose (conspiracy? maybe), it was crazy how they would go on and off as we would get... My rating for this place is",

        "Last night, I attended my first Suns game since moving to Phoenix in late November, so this was my first visit to US Airways Center. \\n\\nIt's definitely a smaller arena but it's clean and the staff is very friendly. Concession prices were around the national average ($5 for a pretzel, $8 for a Grey Goose + pineapple). I sat in sec 108, row 22 and thought I had a very good view of the game. Again, it's a smaller arena so I can't imagine there are really any bad seats. \\n\\nConsidering the arena was only around 2/3 full, the crowd was still loud and \\\"into\\\" the game (as in, people were there for the basketball, not to people watch or \\\"to be seen\\\"). \\n\\nIt's a nice arena, don't get me wrong; it's just nothing special. Parking was DEFINITELY overpriced and it would have been nice if there were handicapped parking spots near the elevator (my mom's disabled and I didn't like that she had to walk across half the parking garage just to get to the elevator). \\n\\nSidenote: My review might have been affected by the game itself, which was also nothing special (I'm a hockey fan so it's hard for me to get excited about a regular season basketball game featuring two teams near the bottom of the Western Conference).\nSo I would like to give it",

Because of you the jeans I bought the same day are loose and I've lost 2 more lbs.\\n\\nSeriously, I can see the cougar potential here, but I am desperately in love with the vibe of this place. You can't do much better at hitting my sexy sophistication love than this place did. The tables alone the sides, the couches, the dance floor and not bad drinks make me wish there was a place like this closer to me, and that I was actually with a date last night.\\n\\nWe arrived around 9:30 and walked right in. It wasn't too crowded last night and the drinks were just the right size and strength. The music was fantastic too.\\n\\nThis is a win ladies. A definite win.\n\nReview rating:",

The quality of music on here is a solid 3/5 rating, but I took a star away for the misleading name.\\n\\nEssentially, this is modern pop hits covering the last few years, though they tend to throw in the occasional 80s pop sons (though this is less common in recent years.)

        "Review: Excellent!!! Great service, great menu choices, clean and efficient. I ordered the German Pancake, and it was better than the one I make. Theirs was soft but firm, very fluffy and so tasty with the powdered sugar and lemon. (The lemon makes it). My dining partners got the crepes, which also looked tasty - and good for a modest appetite. Coffee was a serviceable (Cracked Egg has better coffee, IMHO). \\n\\nOverall, great experience and will be back. Irish omelet looks good for next time. :)\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

There is one big changing area for everyone and then individual rooms as well. They have a small kids play area for toddlers. My kids love to eat dinner at the snack bar after late swim lessons. It is perfect, they change out of their swim suits into their PJs, have hot dogs or chicken fingers at the snack bar then off to home and directly to bed.

What I once thought was an amazing respite from the campus crap that is located near University Ave, I have just realized is full of lame ass poseurs and bull shit bouncers. Case in point: my dear friend was assaulted today (by a bouncer) for insisting that he drink his drink he just paid for at 1:30 am, before legal bar time but after Lava Bar Time.  Despite the fact that the regulars and employees, were allowed to finish and order more beverages, we were violently and rudely ushered outside.   The bouncer, grabbed my dear friend by his arms, ripped his shirt,  forced him to drop his drink and then threw him outside.  The people outside assaulted him further until someone sober enough finally listened to us and realized that we were not drunks, just people who enjoy beer and unfortunately thought we should enjoy it at this odious establishment.\\nFuck this place.

Plain and simple even a little outdated, but they get the job done.  They offer all of your basic services for nails and even waxing although, I've only done regular manis and pedis.  I find that they really take the time to give a good foot & leg massage at no additional cost which is nice.  They also do a good job of scrubbing your feet and heels.  I've been to some places where they didn't put any elbow grease into it, but not these girls.  My friend gets gel every time and raves how their gels last longer compared to other nail salons in the area.  Tiffany gives a great pedi and Sally gives an awesome mani.

Since I went to college in Tempe, I tried finding another hospital out there, but when my chihuahua came down with a stomach illness, I had no doubt to drive almost an hour out to the hospital to make sure my dog got the very best treatment.

        "I will not return, terrible customer service. I ordered a pizza from here because I had received a \\\"welcome\\\" packet with some coupons including one for Demarco's giving a free large 1 topping pizza, dine in or take out. I called and ordered then went to pick it up, upon doing so the hostess told me the owner wasn't accepting these coupons and it's only good with a $40 or something purchase (the coupon was newly received so this wasn't news to the owner he just didn't pull them per the hostess which seems like a scam to me). I politely argued with the girl telling her it doesn't give stipulations anywhere and that's false advertising (not even sure if that's legal?) and very poor customer service for which they would lose customers (like myself). She understood but it was the owners call. I ended up purchasing the pizza (needed to eat!) and the pizza wasn't good. It had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt. Because I'm pregnant I opted not to get too stressed so after stating my views I left vowing that I wont return. Which is unfortunate because it's very close to my home but there are too many other places close enough with better food and certainly better service!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "As we parked we said \\\"Woo HOO!  Unlimited fries!!!\\\"   Why do I mention that first?  Well, I suppose it's important to know that they have unlimited fries, but more important here is knowing the level of culinary excellence we were looking for in this eating experience.  We were out.  We were hungry.  We wanted some place we didn't eat all the time and presto - there it was.  It had been a few years since I'd last been to a Red Robin, and based on this experience - I might go a bit more often.\\n\\nAs we walk in - the hostess area has lots of room for seating and even has a small arcade with about 6 old school video games.  Very cool if you are waiting for a large party, have a long wait , or (let's be honest) if the kids finish eating before you do and you want them to go kill some time so you can eat in peace.  I'm sure your server would be happy to give you quarters.\\n\\nTheir menu is one giant page, stuff on both sides.  I was IMPRESSED with their variety.  Burgers (Beef, Fish, Chicken, Boca, Gardenburger etc) are their main entree here - though they also have \\\"dinners\\\".  They really stretch the burger concept.  Beyond what I mentioned above - which all come in many forms, they also had a Pot Roast Burger (Totally trying that one next time) and a Carnitas burger.  Not your momma's burgers.  I tried the Carnitas burger and my companion had the Whiskey BBQ Bacon burger.  We were tempted to start with their tower of Onion rings (did I mention this was not a diet day?) but decided it was WAY too big for the two of us.  The server mentioned they could do a half order and we caved in.  They were yummy.  Nothing out of this world, but very good.  Came w/ Ranch and a special sauce that the server mentioned was a BBQ + Ranch w/ a kick.  It was interesting.  \\n\\nHer more traditional burger was definitely awesome.   First bite to last - though she only got through the first half of the burger while there and the rest went home.  My carnitas burger was... good.   It was good.  It was far from great, but it was juicy... My rating for this place is",

It took a little longer than expected, so once we noticed people that ordered after us got there food we spoke up. Once they realized they accidentally skipped us they immediately apologized and worked hard to make our food as soon as possible. You could tell they were training people because it is such a new location, Because of the inconvenience they offered us more than enough compensation. It was a simple mistake but we are very pleased with how the workers handled the issue.\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nI've been wanting to try Sardella'a for a while.  I always see their coupons in the mail but never been too interested to check them out.  After a sad departure of Carusotti's which was one of the better pizza joints in the area, and now that Lucky's isn't what it used to be, I decided to try Sardella's.\\n\\nI ordered pizza and wings.  The wings are available in your typical range of spiciness, however Sardella's fortunately has \\\"Suicide\\\", which is always a plus.\\n\\nI ordered the wings extra crispy, however they were not delivered extra crispy, rather just well done.  That was actually fine by me, as long as they were cooked enough so the skin doesn't taste rubbery.  The sauce was really good.  Sometimes \\\"suicide\\\" wings are just lacking in flavor but extremely hot - these were very spicy, but also had strong pepper flavors.    There were also visible flakes of red chilis present on the wings.  All in all I was very happy with the taste, and my head was definitely sweating enough to give me satisfaction.  \\n\\nThe pizza was not bad, however it was rather average.  The hand-tossed crust tasted very similar to a Domino's style crust - somewhat spongey and neither very thick or thin.  The crust edges were rather large, and if you like having \\\"breadsticks\\\" with your pizza, this may have been a bonus for you, but for me, I like a less present crust edge.  As a plus, the ingredients were very good and tasted fresh.  Despite this though, the sauce was not too impressive or memorable.    \\n\\nAll in all I thought they delivered a good pizza that would easily beat your typical pizza delivery, however nothing to rave about.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review: This place has great food and live music at least 5 nights a week.  The food is great, try the burger and fries or the grilled pimento cheese sandwich.  There are also many vegetarian options for people who don't want to eat meat.  This place is small and can get very crowded.   Locals are always around, but Friday night is when everyone packs in to hear the \\\"boys\\\" play (Lenny Federal and John Wicker- the owner, headline the band, son Johnny rules the drums).  The music ranges from old rock and roll, blues, and bluegrass depending upon what night of the week you're there.  This is Dilworth's neighborhood bar, the owner's are actually my parent's next-door neighbor's, and it's a family run place.  Always good to stop by for food or booze.  Closed Sundays.  Oh, and they have won many of the \\\"City's Best\\\" type awards for their fries and burgers if you're into that kind of thing.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I did not like the food here.  I ordered a simple wonton soup, and the soup was too salty and oily.  My boyfriend ordered pho and got soup spilled on him by the waiter, but luckily (or unluckily), the soup was not hot enough to burn him.  I tried some of the pho broth and it wasn't all that great either.  I don't think anyone in our group liked their food.  But when I came to Vegas another time, I stayed in the hotel room feeling sick while everyone else went to eat.  When they came back, my friend brought me the most delicious wonton noodle soup with duck meat.  When we ate here this time, my friend told me the duck wonton soup came from this restaurant.  So maybe we just ordered the wrong thing?  Because I remember that dish being really good... but then again I was super drunk. My rating for this place is",

        "I had an appointment scheduled at the office in Henderson on a Wednesday. I received all call from them on the Friday before my visit asking if I could reschedule because the provider was not going to be in on the Wednesday. I rescheduled for the following Monday.  I was told to show up at 2:50 with my downloaded forms completed by the person who rescheduled me. This is what I did.  As I signed in (at 2:50) the girl behind the desk told me my appointment was at 2:40.  I politely told her that when they called me to reschedule I was told 2:50.  She said, \\\"ok, well I'll see what I can do\\\". A few minutes later I was called up by a different receptionist who told me that I'd have to be rescheduled.  I was polite as I told her that I had already been inconvenienced by being rescheduled the first time and that it was their office who told me 2:50, and by that account I was on time. I told them that I had made arrangements to leave work early to be at this appointment and that I'd really appreciate being seen. She told me that she agreed with me that it was not my fault I was told the wrong time but that I still could not be seen.  She said she could have the office manager call me. I told her to do so.  Then I left, very mad, but still somehow composed.  I waited a day and never heard from the office manager.  I then called a left a message for the \\\"office administrator\\\" (an option on their automated call system), hoping that this person could right this wrong and save me this bad experience.  It's been over 2 weeks now and I've not received any sort of call from this office, either from the administrator or to reschedule. Maybe the provider is good, but I wouldn't know because the office staff could not seem to get it together enough for me to be seen. Save yourself the trouble. My rating for this place is",

The girl administering the pedicures was a sweetheart but the polish never lasted more than a week.  I agree with some of the other clients that the atmosphere was noisy or not professional at times.  I had a 4th appt and never received a confirmation call.  I decided to call to confirm and was told I should have received a call from the salon to cancel since that area of the salon had experienced a flood, and that they would call me to reschedule and that I would not lose my deal.  It's been a few weeks so I decided to call today and found out the salon has been permanently closed.  I could see this coming which is why I'm writing the review in case you ever decide to re-open you can learn from the mistakes made.

When it was clear she had no clue what she was doing and/or what I had asked for, I stopped her.  She gets offended when I ask her if she even understood what I wanted.  She proceeds to tell me about how she's been cutting hair for over 20 years and implies I'm an idiot.  Not only that but the other woman working in the place chimes in as well telling me I didn't ask for an undercut and that it's a woman's hairstyle blah blah blah.  I proceed to literally explain to them how to cut a men's undercut, how to part the hair, that it's not blended, etc.  So anyway, up until now I was the only customer in the place.  After people came in I felt extremely embarrassed to say anything else so I just let this \\\"stylist\\\" finish whatever it was she thought she was supposed to be doing to my hair.

We ate plain cheese though so maybe that explains it.\\n\\nI would say the pizza tastes different from what we make for ourselves, but we will definitely have it again.\\n\\nI wouldn't recommend eating in the store since it's really hot from all the pizza ovens. We got our pizza to go, and it was hot enough that we didn't have to microwave it after a 10 min walk home.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "This review is for the Hoover Dam tour. \\n\\nFirst I would like to start off saying that Bob, our tour guide/driver was knowledgeable and excellent at his job. In fact, he called 15 minutes before pick-up to let me know he was still waiting on someone at another hotel and may be a few minutes late. I appreciated that. \\n\\nThe issue I had was that Pink Jeep schedules all the pick-up times at the same time resulting in delays. If the pick-ups were scheduled in a staggered fashion the final pick-up would not be delayed thus shrinking the amount of time permitted for the actual tour.\\n\\nI also think that the amount of time allotted for the tour was not enough because we rushed directly to the dam tour and made it out just in time to take a few pictures. We did not get to go to the exhibits or walk the top of the dam before we were required to meet back up. This issue could be resolved by not requiring the drivers to gather up each member of the group for a huddle prior to going on the dam tour. This took an extra 30 minutes that we could have already been down on the tour. I noticed that all the other Pink Jeep tours were doing the same thing so it appears to be a company policy. \\n\\nThe pink Jeep is really a pink Dodge but it is one heck of a truck. As a truck guy I read the little pamphlet in the vehicle about the engine, design, capabilities and thought \\\"Cool...I wonder how well it would do in the mud.\\\". Ok, so enough about the truck. The tour was fascinating. Bob drove us through old Boulder City explaining the history of the dam and Boulder city. He got us to the damn, brought us to a place to take pictures then back to the reception center where we were escorted to the secure area where our dam tour began. He gave us a time to meet him back at the meetup point and we were off. \\n\\nThe dam tour provided by the Bureau of Reclamation was very short and hurried but informative and interesting. We were then able to walk on the dam and observation deck taking as many dam pictures as we liked though with such a...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I don't get it. ..it just looks outdated...but not in a fashionable way ...just in a we're going to grandma's house kinda way...In fact, after having stayed the weekend here, im sarting to wonder if all the 4  & 5 star reviews i read beforehand about the vintage charm of the hotel are even real.   \\n\\nThe breakfast at the Come Back In was the real deal.  The buttermilk pancakes were a little bland, the pan fried potatoes were tasty but greasy but, even with that said, breakfast being included as part of the hotel  pkg is definitely a huge plus.\\n\\nOverall, this hotel wouldn't be must first choice to stay at should i need to stay a couple nights in Madison in the future.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous. \\n\\nThink a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.\\n\\nFirst, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury. \\n\\nMy dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \\\"bacon\\\" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)  \\n\\nI will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food.\nSo I would like to give it",

Only one, thus far, has disappointed me, although I think they may have brought us the wrong pancakes.  I have to say, I especially love the yeasty old buckwheat pancakes (which I'm still not entirely convinced you should put the words \\\"yeasty\\\" and \\\"old\\\" next to each other on a food menu) and the sourdough pancakes.  Their regular coffee is just ok (pretty standard diner-style), but they do offer french press coffee there (I've not tried it, but one of these days I will).  Their egg and side offers are pretty generous as well.  More food for a better price than IHOP or Waffle House, I think.\\n\\nThis is my favorite breakfast place...or anytime I want breakfast-for-lunch or for-dinner place!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nThis was a really pleasant surprise.  The normal Friday night ritual erupted last night and that is finding a restaurant interesting enough for me and flexible enough for the lady's particular tastes.  She was going to be nice enough to go to \\\"Dish\\\" although I know it's not one of her favs'.  Mantini's also came across the radar screen.  However, I wanted to try somewhere new and we both wanted to try something budget friendly.  Annie's Mom gave us an \\\"entertainment\\\" book for Christmas and Papa J's was listed as an option.  I checked out the website and was less than enthusiastic.  Unlike its sister restaurant in Carnegie this spot has a stripped down menu.  I'm guessing because it does most of its business during lunch hours and maybe happy hour.  I called the restaurant and they did have many options not on the internet menu including a couple feature dishes (note to restaurant please update your website, you don't even list any pasta dishes as an option for the downtown location).  We decided to check it out after calling her brother Lee who goes often.  We get there around 730 PM last night (Friday).  Upon entering the extremely old (classic) building I'm struck by the interior which is truly \\\"old school\\\".  It's dark wood, exposed brick, ornate lighting and the like...  There are a group of regulars I'd guess sitting at the bar imbibing loudly.  The bartender notices us and asks if we need a table for two.  We are then greeted by a friendly gal (JJ) who takes us to the back dining room which is a bit crowded and she senses our hesitation and takes us to the other side of the bar which only has a few patrons.  Annie confirms with JJ that we can use the entertainment card, she confirms and we save 12 bucks.  She brings us over some decent bread, unfortunately not served warm.  The bread is served along with the obligatory oil and vinegar mix.  She left a big bowl of parmesan cheese for us to add as much as we wanted which was a nice touch.  Annie started with the wedding soup which was okay, but not...\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nA very interesting boutique hotel. I've seen pictures on Hotels tonight and was very intrigued by them and wanted to go by and visit the hotel lobby on my next Vegas visit. Was not intending to stay there, but stayed 1 night because of the good deal on Hotels tonight. Did not know anything about the after-hours club, or the noise level. If I did I would have not chosen to stay here, as the music was overwhelming coming up thru the floors of the 4 story hotel.\\nUpon check in the valet asked if we stayed here before or knew about the hotel. When we said no, he told us about the club going to 8am. Apparently the only nights they do not have the after-hours club is on Monday and Tuesday, so ask for a room that is not over the club. \\nWe are not club people, so getting back into the hotel at night was like going thru security at the airport lol, had to speak to 2 different people to get into the lobby to get to the elevator to get to the room. \\n\\nThe noise level was loud, but it was because the walls were thin and we could hear the dog in the room next door yelp and bark, the traffic outside because of the thin glass window, and the people above us sounded like they were going to come thru the floor into our room when they walked since the squeaking was so bad.\\nAlso the hallways are loud since the floor is tiled and not carpeted. Since this hotel is an old Travelodge, so are the rooms and I took that into consideration with the thin walls and floors. Unfortuantly our A/C didn't cool the room even tho is was on the coolest setting at 60 degrees, it only cooled the room down to about 75. \\n\\nLoved the chic goth style of the hotel, but it's better for more of a drink and not to stay unless maybe you're going to the after-hours party.\\nThe check in gentleman was nice and helpful, but I thought the $150 \\\"deposit\\\" for 1 night was a little steep.\n\nReview rating:",

It is your typical strip mall nail salon but was very clean and nice inside.  \\n\\nI was greeted by the techs and had no wait to get my pedi and boy what a pedi it was!  My nail tech was very nice and talkative.  She wore gloves and used the blue powder to sanitize the bath.  She asked if I wanted my nails cut and filed instead of just buzzing through with the scuff file.  I opted for the sea salt add on for $5 and she literally massaged my legs with the sea salt for 10 minutes!  The sea salt was a nice quality, wasn't too coarse and didn't burn my legs since it sat on them for a while.\\n\\nMy nail tech had a waxing appointment come in about  1/2 way through so another tech took over.  He was very nice and polite but his leg massage was out of this world.  He worked on my pressure points on the bottoms of my feet as well as my calf muscles.  Another ten minute massage on top of the ten min sea salt massage!\\n\\nMy pedicure was $24 with the sea salt but they start at $19.  They also gave me a rewards card for a free service after you have so many mani/pedi's done.

        "Wow.  \\n\\nI died and went to back issue heaven.\\n\\nIt's alarming how hard it is to find a decent archive of back issues in this town.  Well, that's one problem solved.  While the outside doesn't look like much, I did a double take on how absolutely freaking huge (and full) the inside is.\\n\\nSeriously.  There are comics and figures and statues EVERYWHERE.  There's no way someone could make a casual run to this place, expecting a \\\"just a few minutes\\\" visit.  I could spend hours in here and not see everything.  \\n\\nAnd what they have truly feels like everything.  Steven, the owner, told me about the store's 22 years of being in business, and I'd believe it.  Stuff I haven't seen and normally don't see at comic shops line the walls upon walls here.  Cliche or not, I honestly couldn't wrap my head around how much awesome stuff they have here.\\n\\nThe staff and owner were INCREDIBLY nice and friendly.  I took a liking to them instantly, and felt very welcomed there, so much that I see myself being a perma-customer there.  Even the set-up is unusual.  It's like some odd museum where everything can be bought, and there is so much to tempt here.  Easily one of the coolest vibes I've experienced in a comic store in Vegas.\\n\\nWalking outside, I turned around and looked at the storefront I just exited.  There's not even the remotest of clues of what lies inside.  But don't be fooled.  Between the graciously warm welcome and the room upon room (yes, plural) of cool items, it's a shock going in the first time.\\n\\nI don't what what store the one-star review went into, but it wasn't here.  The only thing that I'd agree with is that they are indeed a \\\"Cash Only\\\" shop.  I'm glad that I don't usually carry cash.  I may as well have just handed them over my wallet when I first walked in if my financial preferences were different.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Delay was 6 hours going to Chicago and over 7 hours coming back. The staff are trying to do their job but seems like the situation is out of their control. Amtrak fails to let customers know realistic arrival time. Terrible experience, I give it a F.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nOf all the airports in this part of the country, Phoenix Sky Harbor has to be the easiest to get in and out of--even during the busy season.  I'm sitting at Terminal 4 Baggage Claim right now.  If your flying in, chances are you'll be coming to this terminal.  Eighty per cent (80%) of all flights in or out of Sky Harbor come through this terminal.  It is home to both US Air and Southwest Airlines.   The audio overhead says it's the friendliest airport in America. ..and I just may have to agree.  Look for the friendly seniors wearing purple jackets for information.  If you have to retrieve checked baggage,  go down the escalator as soon as you exit security.   When you get downstairs, you'll see some display boards which will have your flight listed as well as the carousel where your bags are located.  SW Airlines bags will be on the even numbered carousels,  while US Air releases their bags on the odd numbered carousels.   Terminal 4 is cool in that baggage claim even has its own Starbucks...complete with ample leather chairs.  It's a great place to rest up while you wait for a ride, bags or your connecting flight.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nI am writing my review based on my experience last friday (Dec. 26th 2014) when I came in for dinner. I had always came here with my family and we loved the food and experience but when I came in last week, it was like something from a horror show. I couldn't believe the customer service that was not only received but being given to those around us. When we came in, a gentleman said he'd be right with us to seat us. He never came back. Another person came to get us but started giggling and laughing and said to hold on a sec. He was looking at the seating charts I suppose. Another individual came up to help him and they had a whole conversation about where to seat us and who just got someone prior, etc etc. I am standing there in shock because not ONE but TWO other individuals came to help JUST to find us a seat. 4 people and neither could decide where until 1 of them asked a girl behind him if he could seat us with her. She didn't even look up and said \\\"ya sure\\\" in a bothered way. What the heck. I am sorry? We came in just to have a meal and be on our way. Instead we had this circus chain of actions. It gets better. We finally sat down around the right side of the restaurant. I noticed a table near us who had a different waitress. A gentleman asked her if he could have his fork and knife changed out while handing it to her, she rudely asked twice \\\"excuse me what?\\\" and he repeated. She said \\\"Ok yeah\\\" and walked away without even grabbing the utensils he was trying to hand her. We immediately got up and just left. Don't get me wrong, I love Red Lobster, they got wonderful food and beverages. I am rating this based on our experience at this location and how it was handled. The place wasn't even busy that night. There was only 2 other tables on the right side of the restaurant we sat at.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "We arrived at Wild Thaiger on a Friday night at 5:45. The restaurant was busy but there were 3 empty tables and one group of 3 before us that was waiting in the outside patio area. The hostess was nowhere to be seen. About 5 minutes later, she shows up and takes down our names and tells us it will be about 10 minutes for a table for two. We're fine with that so we agree to wait inside the restaurant as it was pretty cold outside. Ten minutes pass. The group of 3 before us is still waiting and the 3 empty tables are still empty. In the meantime, about 5 other groups of people have come in after us and put their names down for tables. The hostess disappears again at 6pm. I noticed this because I looked at my phone and the 10 minute wait was now 15 and the group before us still had not been seated. About 5 minutes later, the hostess comes back to seat the group of 3 and disappears again. Two couples come into the the restaurant and after waiting 5 minutes at the hostess station, one of the couples walks to the back, hoping to get someone's attention so they  can put their name down for a table. We watched them stand there for 5 minutes and then walk out of the restaurant. 6:15. No sign of the hostess. Other people have arrived and walked out as well. We see the hostess clear a table and then bring to go boxes to a table and walk right by us. She doesn't make eye contact, she doesn't apologize, she doesn't tell us it will be just a few minutes. In fact, she scurries away so quickly, she doesn't hear us when we say \\\"Excuse me, miss?\\\" to get her attention to find out how much longer it will be. Most of the people who were in the restaurant when we arrived are now finishing their meals. It's 6:25 and the hostess has been away from her station for 25 minutes. Our 10 minute wait was 40 standing up without so much as an apology or offer of water or a drink while we waited. We decided to leave and as we walked out, wished the 6 groups of people behind us \\\"good luck\\\". Maybe they'd get one of the still empty tables....\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

They have a nice open patio in the back looking over the water feature at Anderson Springs. I have not had a bad meal here ever. Everything is tasty and fresh. Kyle was our server and he was friendly and fast. He even offered to put some ice tea in a to-go cup. I've been to Pita Jungle in Pasadena, CA and in Irvine, CA it's not the same in Cali. It's way better in AZ. Certain evenings have live music. This is a great place for a date with music, wine with some apps; how can you go wrong?

        "Review text:\nMy sister in law planned an overnight stay in Madison and at her suggestion we checked in at the Ruby Marie. My husband and I opted for a premium room because we wanted the jacuzzi, and with the fireplace it just sounded so cozy. We all arrived early since we were going to a local show and the person at the desk, Dylan or John, I'm not sure, was nice enough to let us check in before the scheduled time. The price of the room ($160 + taxes came about to $183) included two drink vouches at the Up North and a breakfast voucher for two at the Come Back In. The room itself was really nice. The bed was very comfortable, the jacuzzi was a pretty decent size, and the fireplace gave the room a really nice atmosphere. Really, the biggest negative experience of our stay there was getting our free drinks at the bar. When we checked in we were told the 3pm-7pm happy hour on the voucher was more of a suggestion than a rule. After we got back we went straight to the Up North around 7:10, not long after the show finished. The bartender seemed drunk and was acting really obnoxious. I asked for a bloody mary and the bartender's response was \\\"Seriously? I just put everything away.\\\" and he seemed so annoyed at my request. He made a few sarcastic/rude comments while making my drink too, and I've never had someone make me feel like such an inconvenience all because I ordered one drink. My sister in law asked for a bourbon and coke and he gave her a bourbon and WATER and they had to ask for a coke on the side. Afterwards we went to Essen Haus, but that's another review entirely. The jets in our jacuzzi also didn't work, but after calling the front desk in the morning they gave us a partial refund. I was a little disappointed, but because they did what they could, I can't really fault them for that. Breakfast at the Come Back In ended up being one of the biggest highlights of our stay, at least for me it was. With the voucher we were able to get prime rib and eggs and two bloody marys. The prime rib was cooked very nicely, with the...\n\nStars:",

We missed the food, the atmosphere and the familiar faces. So we decided to give Baoding a try on the off-chance it might be some sort of substitution. To me, JoJo's was the best Chinese food in Charlotte with impeccable service and a relaxing atmosphere so it has big shoes to fill.\\n\\nWe walked in and immediately the ambiance grabbed me. It was dim but not dark and the lighting and d\\u00e9cor were eclectic and sort of mellow. There is a big mural on the wall behind the bar that looked really neat and we recognized the same over the table light fixtures that were at JoJo's. Look, a piece of home! Our server was quick to bring our drinks - I had a glass of wine and the hubs had some cold sake. We took our time with the menu because it was unfamiliar and organized differently than the one at JoJo's. I was sad that they didn't have egg drop soup. (JoJo's used to not have egg drop soup but then eventually added it. Maybe Baoding will as well.) Instead of a soup, I got a spring roll, which was very good. Hubs got a spring roll and the hot and sour soup, his usual favorite, which he enjoyed. It was just as good as JoJo's, although a different color and slightly different ratio of ingredients. \\n\\nFor our main courses, I got the moo shu chicken (my JoJo's favorite) and he got sesame chicken, his overall Chinese favorite. The moo shu was presented differently than it was at JoJo's (there you build your own with the tortillas served separately, here they were served already wrapped up) but it was every bit as good. The flavors and textures were basically the same so I was pretty happy. Hubs really loved his sesame chicken, saying it was just as good as what he was used to. \\n\\nWe saw only one familiar face from JoJo's but he was happy to see us and presented us with a free dessert for being JoJo's regulars, which made us so happy.

        "Review: The food here is pretty good.  The spinach and artichoke dip is really creamy and tasty.  For main courses, I've had the cheeseburger and ribs.  The cheeseburger had a juicy patty and a soft bun that soaked up all of the juices.  The ribs were extremely tender with the meat falling off the bone.  I believe they were pork ribs and were served wet with a sweet bbq sauce.  The coleslaw was great...mayo base so it was pretty creamy.  The fries are awesome.  Similar to shoestring fries and perfectly salted.  Also, I've had a bite of the filet and it was pretty darn good.  Cooked medium and really tender.\\n\\nThis place loses stars though because the service is really hit or miss.  The waiters and waitresses can be really knowledgeable, but they go missing during times and can't be found when you need refills, more ketchup, etc.\\n\\nThe other thing that takes off a star is just the idea that this place serves sushi.  I'm completely turned off by that and really don't think sushi and an American steakhouse should mix.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Ordered a burger with onion rings on the advice of the server after classifying both as \\\"amazing.\\\"  Burger was over cooked...even tough.  Onion rings were deep fried hard with the centers rather cool telling me they sat for a bit.  My blessed other half did a 12 wing split between BBQ and teriyaki.  Wings were rather good.  Fries were ordered with them and hand to remind the server of the order.  Then she asked twice if she wanted fries.  Now why would we have ordered them?  Did a Coors Light on tap...beer was cold but far from ice cold.  Ordinary bar food, over cooked, short menu selection considering, cold but not ice cold tap beer, mediocre service.  Probably will not return.  Many other sports bar choices that are far superior.\n\nStars:",

Sushi combo plate was so weak it's not even funny, 8 pieces of California roll, 1 piece salmon, 1 piece of tuna, 1 piece shrimp and a salad with freaking blue cheese on it?!? Anyways, potstickers were good and the edamame was great(but pretty salty). Here is the kicker of the whole evening that will insure I never go back. My friend left his brand new iPhone 5 on the table by accident, came back literally 2 minutes later and it was gone. Table had been cleared and no phone in sight. We asked the manager about it and very rudely, and almost annoyed with us, just kept reiterating that nothing was turned in and that her entire staff had been there 10 years with no incident. Really? That's a lie just in the fact that our waitress was probably 22 so she would have been working since 12 years of age. Nice! The manager did not apologize even once for the situation. Very disappointed in the way she handled it.\n\nReview rating:",

We were pleasantly surprised by the restaurant's view of the lake, the wine shop and the evening's entertainment.  However our waiter was frequently MIA and as a result the amount of time we waited was unacceptable.  It took almost 30 minutes to get our salads/soups.  After another 30 minutes went by we flagged down our waiter to find out where our entrees were.  When the entrees did come out we only got 4 out of 5.  It took another 10 minutes for the 5th entree to be brought out.  My entree was cold.  And my sisters entree (the risotto) was under cooked.  The waiter blamed the situation on new staff in the kitchen, but even if that was true he should have been paying attention to what was going on.  The restaurant was busy, but they weren't slammed.  I requested to speak to the manager.  He was apologetic, comp'd my meal and brought a sampling of desserts for the table to share.

I have only eaten at the Scottsdale location but my comment is for the Central location.\\nMy mom and I went in there this evening after having lunch at the Scottsdale location. We stopped in because the Scottsdale location had run out of banana pudding and i was craving it. I called ahead to make sure the Central location had not run out as well. I told the hostess on the phone that I was heading in to get some \\\"To Go\\\". Upon arrival we walked in and advised the hostess that we wished to place a dessert order to go. She promptly replied that they are NOT DOING ANY TO GO ORDERS!! HUH??? I advised the hostess that my mom and I only wanted banana pudding and a slice of red velvet cake, plus had called just 10 minutes prior. Again she reminded me that they had been advised by management that there would be no to go orders because they \\\"Backed up\\\" the kitchen and delayed orders. Even for dessert that takes 2 minutes???? It would seem to me that if you do not have enough staff to fully run your business then you should probably look into hiring another cook!!! But I must have mistaken the establishment for a restaurant, silly me! After checking with management the hostess returned and reluctantly took my order. I asked my mom if she wanted the Red Velvet cake or the Soc it to me cake. The hostess interrupted to advise me that they didnt have that there. I reminded her that the sign outside stated that it was one of the specials today!! \\nIt took longer for the hostess to take my money and give receipt than it took to get my order packaged to go.\\n\\nI love Lo-Lo's. My family and I eat at the Scottsdale location 3 times a month. We get the best service there. I have been to the location on Central twice and twice they have failed to provide any service even close to the service in Scottsdale. I am uncertain if it is the location and blatant disregard for customers or a Management issue. Either way, I will not be returning to the Central location.

He decided to turn it into a regular old church service and my late friend was an Atheist so it didn't come off as very respectful to me or my other friends that attended.  A good pastor would, assuming he didn't have the luxury of getting to know the deceased when they were still alive, take the time to interview close friends and family so when funeral time comes around, he/she would have at least SOMETHING comforting to offer those of us that need closure.\\n\\nLike I said, I'm sure this pastor meant well, but he did it so half-assed.  As a Christian myself, I truly thank God that we had a chance to get what we needed at my departed friend's mother's house after the services.

        "*My husband and I bought a brand new (so I thought) 07 Santa Fe with 61 miles in April 2007.  2 days later I had to bring it back because the a/c stopped working.  Then next summer I had to take it back again because the a/c stopped again.  At that point my car had lost more than half of the Freon it needs to run. \\n*Then again in summer 2009 it stopped working again.   O'Briens then told me that they put a bunch of dye in and filled the Freon up again and to bring it back in 3 days.  I did just that.  Once again they told me the checked the system and the entire lines and found nothing.  Same thing the next following 2 years and informed me that in order to actually cool my car it needed to be on recirculate to keep my large car cool.  I was like whatever and took it to another Hyundai dealership that treated me the same way. \\n*Finally in summer of 2012 I was mad and insisted theycheck everything related to the a/c. They said that the rear a/c evaporator needed to be replaced.  So they replaced it and didn't charge me the $100 deductible that my warranty required.  I was happy again thinking all was fixed and now we are good.\\n*I WAS SO WRONG!  Now 14 months later my a/c stops working AGAIN.  At this point I asked for all of the service records on my car.  Come to find out that my car has had an a/c problem at 11 miles in 2006.  I would have thought any respectable car dealership would of mentioned that when I had to bring it back 2 days after we bought it.  And now it's the same part they replaced last year and the part warranty expired at 12 months so our extended warranty should cover it but they would need and inspector to come and look at it and that usually takes 24-48 hours.  I was PISSED! So they gave me a free rental (so I thought O'Briens were covering the cost of the rental) car to drive for as long as in needed it they said.  I thought that O'Briens was doing everything they could to make Jared and I happy customers.  \\n*NOPE! They called me 5 days later and said yes the warranty company is...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nMr. C and I met a friend at this restaurant a few weeks ago for happy hour in the bar area. We ordered the calamari, the sliders and the mussels and clam dish.   I really enjoyed the seafood dishes. They were very good.  In fact, the whole table was dipping bread the leftover sauce! (Yum!)    I personally didn't care for the sliders, but my husband gobbled them up!  \\n\\nThe reason I'm totally my rating at four stars is because the group that played that night was terrible. Honestly, I felt like I was being standoffish to the rest of my party because I couldn't hear my husband who was sitting next to me, let alone our friend's friends who sat across the table!  Another thing that bothered me is that this group didn't have a solid repertoire.  One moment they're playing Beatles (which they butchered) then they played \\\"Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting.\\\"  (SERIOUSLY!? At an Italian restaurant???)\\n\\nBecause we met our friend for happy hour, we plan to return another time and use our restaurant.com coupon, and sit in the dining room rather than the bar.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "mmmm....eerrrr... this is not real barbeque.  The ribs don't taste bad, but they aren't cooked slow enough, because the meat doesn't fall off the bone and all the flavor comes from the sauce that's slathered on it, not the actual meat.  The turkey was a insult to the art of barbecuing -- it tasted like deli meat that had been sprayed with liquid smoke.\nSo I would like to give it",

I had a \\\"private tour\\\" by an employee once and got to see everything and it really is a great place.\\nWent for a birthday party and we had dinner.  $5 for valet parking, which is really reasonable, I think.  Especially in heels, cuz this girl ain't walkin' up them thar stairs.  \\nWe had a private dining room, about 25 or so of us.  Wait staff did an awesome job dealing with such a huge party and handling our bill.\\nIf it weren't for the food and price, I would have given this place 5 stars.  I started with the leek tart, which was amazing and a great portion size for an appetizer.\\nNext, had the Tuna Nicoise salad.  This is where they lose a star, and it wasn't just me voicing a problem with the size of the portion.  There was definitely plenty of tuna on it, but as Erin said \\\"You'd think they would have put more of the cheap stuff on it\\\" meaning there wasn't a whole lot of salad.  And the roasted potatoes that came with it?  I had two cubes of HARD potatoes.  They were barely cooked.  The tuna was perfectly seared on the outside and still nicely red on the inside.  If it weren't for that, I would have been horribly disappointed.  $43 for an appetizer, a salad and a bottle of Pellegrino.  (That included the gratuity added for such a large group).  \\nWrigley is all about the ambiance and view, and it surpasses what you could describe it to be.  Seeing the city at night and being surrounded by cool peeps is what really made the place!\n\nStars:",

        "Review: I've revisited this Menards countless times over the past few months. Lately, I've only been coming here when I absolutely must; I much prefer going to my local hardware store - their selection for anything that's not a big-ticket item is better, as is the service and overall experience. \\n\\n- There are signs posted in several places that claim, \\\"No waiting for savings! If there are more than 2 customers waiting to check-out, we'll open additional check-out lanes!\\\" -- I have yet to see this happen. A most recent visit left us waiting in line for nearly 10 minutes before checking out.\\n\\n- The indoor/outdoor lumberyard is a source of frustration. I would venture a guess that one of the more commonly sought items from a hardware store like Menards is the basic 2x4 (or similar dimensional piece of lumber). Any idea where they're located? We wandered the indoor lumberyard for a good 5 minutes before realizing that the 2x4s are located in the faaaaaaaaaar back corner from the main entrance. You have to walk by scores of 1-by-whatevers, fence posts, fence slats, decorative posts, synthetic decking, lattice, and other rarely used items before you get to the 2-by-whatevers. Do you need pressure treated wood? That's outside, somewhere. Do you need cedar? That's on the opposite end of the indoor yard. Do you need plywood? It's at the front of the lumberyard. Do you need insulation? It's in the middle of the lumberyard... catch the problem? There's zero organization/logic...\\n\\n- The outdoor lumberyard. I hate (as do my contractor friends) checking in and out with the lumberyard guard. Put it all inside like every other store does and call it good.\\n\\n- Limited supply of plumbing items. I recently needed a Sharkbite connector for a plumbing project I was doing with PEX. Menards didn't have the fittings, but my tiny little local Ace Hardware did. A few days ago, I needed a John Guest fitting, which Menards didn't have, but my local Ace Hardware did. \\n\\n+ Holiday sales are usually a good deal, especially for large...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nI usually wash my own car, but when the wife got a used Acura MDX in BLACK of all colors...I gave up.  No matter what the Hell I do, when I washed it all it left me was streaks and sore wrists.  Black leaves scratches and swirls no matter what!  It drove me crazy.  Not to mention every time I washed it, the darn thing took a chunk of my afternoon.  One weekend after I got it washed and waxed...and it rained two days later...I said 'F this'.  I'd rather be chased by a horde of hungry walkers than have to waste my time washing this car again.  I am taking this thing to a car wash from now on!\\n\\nBut I hate most car wash places because of the stupid brushes they use to clean your car.  Majority of them are very harsh, and they leave tons of scratches!  I have on occasion come back from a car wash and have had to use touch up paint to cover up some spots those brushes managed to mess up.  But after much looking, I have finally found a decent car wash spot near me.\\n\\nI noticed that Craig Road Car Wash has a few real low scores.  That's kinda to be expected with the volume of cars they do on a daily basis.  Come on, desert dust mixed in with 100+ degree heat!  Pay to wash my car?  Yes, please!  This place is almost constantly busy.  Of course there will be some unsatisfied folks.  Here's a few tips about Craig Road Car Wash.  Go early:  they usually open around 8:00 AM most days.  Go there early when the sun isn't at it's hottest and the place isn't that busy yet.  You will get a bit better attention for your sweet ride.  Don't like the work they did?  Go over it as soon as you get your keys back and keep asking for things to get addressed.  Water stains leftover?  Have them wipe it over.  Streaks?  Have them wipe it over.  Something missing?  Definitely get this looked at BEFORE you leave the car wash.  I always make them address something before I give them a tip, and on all cases so far they've taken care of my car.  But, go earlier in the morning before it gets busy if at all possible.  Also, think about...\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nI dunno why it says it's closed because it's totally NOT closed.\\n\\nWhile on my week long vacay here in Phoenix (to stay with The Boyfriend), I have been searching long and hard for places to exercise at. I tried the Valley of the Sun Jewish Center (awesome!) and then I tried this place yesterday. \\n\\nMore specifically, I went to their pool, which is open from 1-4pm in the summer for open swim. \\\"Open swim\\\" times basically means the pool is divided into 3 sections: 1 for the water slide, 1 for the kiddies to run around in, and 1 for lap swimmers (2 lanes are devoted to this). \\n\\nThe pool itself is a decent size, clean, and busy (who blames them?! the heat here is almost unbearable!!). It's $3/adults and $1/kids and there are plenty of lifeguards roaming around just in case you start drowning (knock on wood).\\n\\nWhile I appreciate the 2 lanes for lap swim, it's near impossible to actually lap swim because the kids just float around between the lanes and the play area and there's no type of regulation. I swear, if I hadnt double checked a few times I wouldve run into a handful of kids during my 40minute stint there.\\n\\nSo while it's a nice pool, I don't think I'll be going back. I believe I was the only person over 16 years of age that was not a parent of some sort. \\n\\nI've made a list of Reasons to go to this Pool:\\n- you have child(ren)\\n- you have a couple hours to kill... and youre on a budget... and you have child(ren)\\n- your child(ren) are annoying and complaining about heat\\n- your child(ren) are out of school for the summer and you need to entertain them somehow\\n- its your kid(s) birthday and youre on a budget\\n- youre teaching your child(ren) how to swim\\n\\nReasons you SHOULDNT go to this pool:\\n- youre over 16, single, and without kids\\n- you want to get actual exercise done\\n- you want to lay out at a pool\\n- you hate kids\\n- you dont wanna get sunburned\\n- you wanna experience a \\\"pool party\\\" (this is not an adult pool party scene)\\n\\nThat said, happy pool-ing!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nI went to Graceland Automotive, but never got around to writing the review. To all of the people who suffered as I suffered, forgive me for not warning you sooner. I got caught in a snow storm on Christmas and had an accident. My insurance company, Geico, towed my car to Graceland for the body work. Unfortunately for me, I have a very nice sound system in my car. The person who worked on my car thought it was nice too, because the IDIOT turned the volume up high enough to blow out my speakers. When I dropped off the car, it was tuned to the CD player. I even went back to the car to get CDs out. So, I'm positive that the CD player was the last thing I accessed on my radio. When I picked up my car, it was tuned to an unknown radio station, and no sound came out of my speakers. Graceland Automotive swore that they never touched my radio and and that it magically changed to a local PA radio station on its own. Since I was not from PA, I had to drive home to VA with no sound and attempt to resolve the issue from there. Of course, Graceland Automotive refused to pay for the damage to my speakers, costing me over $400 in electrical repairs. They also managed to severely damage my steering column when they repaired the damage to the front of the vehicle. I had to send my car back to Geico to get additional repairs at a local shop in VA. These guys are shady, they do shotty work, cause additional damage, and then stick the customers with the bill. Moral of the story: DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR TO GRACELAND AUTOMOTIVE!!!!\n\nStars:",

The staff is great at making a person feel like scum of the earth for drinking coffee or juice because of the effects it has on teeth, even if the teeth are healthy.  You can relive getting lectured by your parents as they talk about the finer points of proper brushing from your vulnerable position strapped in a chair.  Few survive getting a filling but it is rumored that the experience is as pleasant as hearing fingernails on a chalkboard.  They are very talented in manhandling delicate gum tissue and patients are guaranteed a sore mouth for the rest of the day.  Customer service is second to none.  The office has evening appointments and if you are fortunate to schedule one you will be offered a once in a life time opportunity to come in earlier.  However if you are not able to get off of work and have to decline coming in early do not be surprised to get a call back from the receptionist informing you that your evening appointment is canceled because something unexpected has come up.  They like to provide service the old fashioned way so do not expect any state of the art technology.

Fries looked fresh cut but were soggy. Mr. said his was good though, once he added some mayo. Only plus is that the burger was clearly handmade and not some frozen patty.\n\nReview rating:",

They did the prick test where they tested my back for about 90 things (it turns out dust, my arch nemesis since I was a child, is still an angry little irritant, literally) and recommended a nasal spray, some allergen covers, and a deep cleaning of my house.  I skipped the dust covers, but cleaned my house but good and used the spray, and I've been doing great.  Friendly staff, I liked my doctor, and I didn't wait long (besides the time for the actual test).  Very happy with their service and recommendations!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I was disappointed with the food and really disappointed with the service. I won't be back. \\n\\nOur server clearly did not want to be there; she seemed annoyed that we were sat in her section. She didn't know the menu very well, and kept having to (unapologetically) leave the table to run our questions by the other staff.\\n\\nMy boyfriend had the stroganoff and I had a veggie burger. Both plates came out within 10 minutes, which always makes me a little nervous. His was sub par; he ate about 35% of it. The veggie burger was near the quality that I've come to expect from most restaurant vegetarian options. The bread was decent, and the patty was an unaltered Boca burger. Everything was below average, except for the music, which was about average.\\n\\nThey played it at a decent volume (thank you), and was probably someone's itunes playlist of hits from the 90s. I'm okay with that.\\n\\nThey do have a decent amount of TVs (though nothing to swoon about in my opinion), however they are small and outdated. Most of the ones near us were staticy. I ended up watching the game from a TV that was half way across the room, the only one in our section of the restaurant with a decent picture.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "If iPic were a swanky Scottsdale nightclub, Ferelli's would be Applebees. Affordable, comfortable, and fun.  The place does smell like it's been there forever, but I felt like it was clean and decent quality. Our server was really nice, even when I told him we weren't ordering entrees. We had two appetizers- crab dip and chicken nachos. Both were good. Also ordered dessert but it never came. It was just a miscommunication between servers. No biggie. I would definitely go back with a group of friends or my family.  \\n\\nThe movie screen was big, picture quality was good, and the sound LOUD (which was good for the action movie we saw).\\n\\nI bought a coupon off Deal Chicken which made the evening super affordable (less than $50 for 3 people's tickets, sodas, appetizers, and tip).  \\n\\nSide note: There are three levels of seating. It seemed like the front section would've been too close.\nSo I would like to give it",

It's like when you ask a teenager, \\\"How was your day?\\\" and get the standard \\\"Ok.\\\" No originality at all.\\n\\nHowever, I just went there a few days ago with my co-workers, and I really can't recommend the place highly.

The chicken was great, huge chicken breast, with a good flavor. However, the fries were hard and cold.  I had to stop after a few because I was worried about breaking off a tooth.  \\n\\nWell, the dog is whining to go out, so I'll review.  Fries: 1/5. Chicken 4/5. Prices: 3/5. Service 3/5.

All of the other items seemed no better than from-the-freezer snacks I can get at the grocery store.  Are they making any of these on site?  Maybe, but it sure didn't taste like it.  The crab puffs were the most disappointing.  So little crab, so much cream cheese.  They should definitely take a look at that ratio and either rename the dish or up the crab quantity.

We were seated in the back corner and given plenty of space for our party which was nice, considering it was primetime on a Saturday night.\\n\\nThat was pretty much when the good things I have to say about the restaurant end. Our server, from beginning to end, was slow. I would post his name, but I don't know if that's against Yelp rules. I ordered a honey dijon chicken sandwich with french fries. The fries were mediocre at best (not hot, plain tasting) and the sandwich was pretty poor. I don't know how you can screw up grilled chicken, cheese, bacon and honey dijon sauce. The bottom of the bun was completely soggy and the sandwich as a whole was bland. Our guest of honor (the birthday girl) ordered a steak which she had to return because it was almost raw inside. She had asked for medium well. Several members of our group DID, however, like their food.\\n\\nGoing back to the service, several members of our party waited several minutes for drink refills. Also, we had to flag our waiter down for our checks after waiting close to (if not more than) 20 minutes. Even after we gave him our checks and credit cards, he took close to another 10 minutes to bring them back. \\n\\nOur best guess is that he knew he was adding an 18% gratuity to our checks because of our party size, so he took his time doing everything. I seriously considered crossing out the 18% and leaving 10% and noting on the tab that the service didn't warrant the 18%, but in the end, I opted against it.\\n\\nDefinitely will not return.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nWe mentioned Yelp but did not get 10% off our ticket.  Our waitress had never heard of Yelp.  Anyhoo, dined at 7 pm on a Thurs. Evening- got right in, no reservations.  Casual elegance- pretty wooden arches and lighting- sat by a large window.  Not too stuffy- we were fine in jeans.  Soft music in background allows conversion to flow without shouting.  Family next to us dined with their happy,loudly talkative baby and no one minded her.  :).   We had our 10 year old daughter and 6 yo son with us. Everyone scarfed down the delish bread and butter.  Jack had fried chicken tenders and mashed potatoes- best any of us ever tasted!  Bella had shells with white sauce and real Parmesan on top- it was good, but the Parmesan is NOT from a bottle like it is at home, and she was not fond of it.  I suggest getting it on the side just in case your kids might agree w/her.  I got the goat cheese salad because it was so praised, only to discover I am not fond of warm balls of goat cheese.  I guess I am a cold goat cheese gal.  My hubby liked it, though.  The waitress was very attentive.  I tried To convince her my salad was okay, but upon her further questioning, I fessed up and said I wasn't a huge fan of it. \\nMy hubby loved his Salmon, even though it looked to be a small piece, he felt satisfied with it.  I got the veggie plate for my meal-  way too tangy for me, due to the glazes on them.  Told the busboy I was finished with almost a full plate left.  He tipped off the manager, who was concerned that I wasn't happy, and she offered me something else, but I was full on bread, salad, and sampling the kids' meals, so I declined.  She took BOTH off our bill, even though I had eaten all the salad, because I said I wasn't crazy about it.  We did share two desserts amongst the 4 of us.  The peanut butter pie was dense and rich, but not overly peanut-buttery.  My son doesn't like peanut butter but loved it!  Chocolate crepes were delish- homemade ice cream melts quickly though, so eat fast!  The ice cream was the best I've ever...\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nI LOVE Italian food.  With that being said, it's kinda hard to mess up a good pasta dish with marinara sauce and generous use of garlic.  In this respect, Romano's doesn't dissapoint.  Yet with a million and one places in town to get good Italian food, this place ranks about halfway.\\n\\nWhy you ask?  I visited yesterday for lunch and had a decent meal.  I began their bread: warm, \\\"rustic\\\", and served with olive oil.  Then, I had a salad with house dressing (a balsamic, Greek-ish tasting concoction) and Chicken Parmesan.  The rosemary on top was a nice touch that other chains don't do. The sauce was good, but no different really than Bertolli's chunky marinara in a jar. Otherwise, it was as predictable as any meal at Olive Garden or Carraba's.  For $12, I was a bit dismayed at the portions.  The service was virtually non-existent during our meal; the water glasses were not refilled. The service alone brings the rating down to 2.  \\n\\nThough I would return to Romano's if invited by someone, I'm shocked (or perhaps lulled into apathy) by its mediocrity.  I suppose this place makes a nice lunch destination, but don't expect to be \\\"wowed\\\" by it.  Its neither elegant or authentic, its just another Italian chain.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

However, sometimes their burritos are made very sloppily and they leave their nachos out too long and they get stale. If a burrito tears the really should re-wrap it instead of giving it to a customer and no one likes stale nachos. But the killing blow came when they got rid of the Mol\\u00e9 burrito. It really set them apart from the competition and their mol\\u00e9 sauce was amazingly tasty. Even the more \\\"authentic\\\" local restaurants in the area have not made a mol\\u00e9 that tasted as good. They replaced it with a rather disgusting BBQ burrito that pales in comparison. Without the mol\\u00e9 burrito there really is no reason to choose Qdoba over Chipotle unless you're looking for nachos in particular. Worse yet they keep very inconsistent hours when students are away. I made a trip to campus town especially to try them again and they were closed... so I went to Chipotle instead.\n\nStars:",

I was a little disappointed that I was told that the cakes would easily fit on any normal sized cake plate with a dome. This was not the case and therefore the cakes did get mushed eventually. Also, they arrived later than expected which had my maid-of-honor and mother in a panic. I had to call 3 times on the morning of my wedding to make sure that they were coming. However, it all turned out fine. The cakes tasted wonderful and the gentleman who helped us at our cake tasting was really nice.\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nI like this tucked away pub. Plus it's close to work & home. Plus they typcially have decent beer/drink special. And more recently (ex. earlier this week), I found out they have Bingo on Mondays! \\n\\nLet me clarify my 4-star rating. I enjoy a good pub/watering hole. I think a lot of places in Charlotte get too packed (seriously who wants to wait an eternity to get a lousy overpriced beer?). Tyber Creek Pub is what it is: low-key spot that gets forgotten at times, and I'm glad because I can find a table and enjoy some $3 pint special. \\n\\nHowever I wish their food is more solid. Most recently I ordered the beef skewer and I don't know if it's my fault for having it medium rare. I swear it tasted a little bad. And the soup of the day was incredibly salty, to the point of inedible. \\n\\nThus, this is not a 4-star food review. But this is a solid 4-star let's get your drink  on review.

        "Sharia don't like it, and neither does Becky. \\n\\nBoy and I went to Casbah on a warm Tuesday evening. The restaurant wasn't busy, and we were seated in the inviting outdoor patio. Our waitress was very pleasant and extremely informative about both the drink and food menus. \\n\\nWe shared a bottle of Mission la Caminade (Malbec, French). This was a very good, medium-bodied wine. \\n\\nMany yelpers have raved about Casbah's bread and pesto. I don't get it. I've had much better sourdough elsewhere and the pesto wasn't anything to write home about. \\n\\nI had the asparagus soup with crab for an appetizer.  The soup was served cold and tasted fresh enough, but something was off, and I barely ate half of it. \\n\\nI ordered the orecchiette pasta as an entree, which was served with grilled chicken and cranberries in a goat cheese cream sauce. I am upset to report that this tasted rather bland. The cranberries were the only spark of flavor in the dish.  Boy ordered the ricotta cavatelli pasta, which was in a marinara sauce with sausage and ricotta. I am sad to report that this too was tasteless. The ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish. \\n\\nWe glanced at the dessert menu, after spending so much on food we didn't enjoy, boy and I decided to cross the street for ice cream, instead. \\n\\nOverall, Casbah has a nice atmosphere and service, but their food quality doesn't match the price tag.\nSo I would like to give it",

When this was Supreme Master I knew I was in for a long wait and this is still the case, a party had to get their own menus they grew too impatient. Don't expect to be out of here in 45 minutes or under an hour for that matter.\\n\\nVegetarian meals shouldn't be this hard to find and they are not, this is just another option to consider if you are on this side of town. I have found some items on the menu I can cross off, and some I will always make my regular rotation. Service is friendly but be sure to snatch your desserts before you hit the table, otherwise they will be gone by the time you finish your meal. Cheesecake is very popular and is frequently sold out. Just thought you should know that, before the vultures swarm.\\n\\nThe Heaven Rice Rolls $4.00 are okay if you are a fan of the rice paper wrapping, although I did not like the cold, rubbery, not too flavorful texture. The peanut sauce was a compliment to every dish however, and could go on anything (it is supposed to come with a hoisin sauce). The Moo Shu Vegetables $6.95 came differently than how they are supposed to on the menu, it came wrapped tightly again with a rice paper instead of in a wheat Moo Shu skin. Not acceptable.\\n\\nThe Sweet and Sour Divine $8.50 (rice separately white $1.00, brown $1.25) was delicious, a true vegan \\\"junk food\\\" delight. Soy protein, pineapple, carrots, and homemade S&S sauce which I thought they gave me a little too much of but that's okay. It looked like real chicken, tasted like real chicken, and although I have been a vegetarian for 8 years, it was reminiscent of the real thing and recreated that memory for me of eating some S&S Chicken. My mom who is not in anyway shape or form a vegan, was shocked by the taste of the dish (she was a butcher for many years).\\n\\nThe Guru Curry $7.50 is made like a thin Thai curry so don't expect a thick Indian or Chinese curry.

        "I had high hopes for this place after a friend said it was a well known gem with the Japanese in Charlotte. I enjoy restaurants that are run and frequented by people who know the food well. My friend and I came here on a Thursday night around 8:30pm and were the only souls in the place. Let me also say how hard it was to find this place. Granted, it was raining and dark, but their sign was not lit and was hard to see amoungst the other places in this strip/suite mall. I was anxious to try the ramen noodles since it was a cold, rainy night and it sounded very comfortable, like memories from college days. The bowl was very large but could have used more noodles. I don't eat pork and there were 3 hefty slices in the bowl which my friend gladly ate. Overall the ramen tasted good, but there could have been much more noodles and less broth. This would be a great meal to eat if you had a cold or wanted to be warmed quickly. My friend had the squid salad which was pretty good. We also had 3 different sushi rolls which were named after a baseball theme. The spicy tuna roll was pretty bland. It was wrapped in tuna and had spicy tuna in the middle of the rice roll. The tempura shrimp roll was good but a little large to eat with chopsticks or even your fingers! We also had some sort of avocado and crab roll which was fairly decent. Overall this place was just ok. I may be back for some take out ramen but honestly I could probably just make my own at home for 95 cents and add some veggies.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

When the bowling game is functional it promotes awesomely competitive tournaments and if you take over the jukebox the moment you arrive you create your own ambience.  Bring a friend, split the Super Wineburger with Cheese and an order of Chicken Fingers, leave happy.  Wash, Rinse, Repeat as desired.

        "So I fly on average twice a month. I'll start off by saying that it's all about which Terminal you use. If you're travelling Southwest or US Airways, you will unfortunately have to use Terminal 4. While it is the new and largest Terminal, it is also the busiest....by FAR!!!!! I can never accurately predict how busy it will be. On any random Friday, I can expect a LONG, SLOW security line-especially when I'm running late. I still fail to understand how they will only man 2 of the 3 i.d check stations when the lines are long......and don't get me started on the security and x-ray stations. I got to experience the awesome new airport in Singapore and thinking about while in line at Terminal 4 at Sky Harbor almost makes me cry every time.\\n\\nWhere this terminal is the best is in the choice of food and drinks. This is where Terminal 4 shines. They close early though, so if you're leaving after 8:00pm, forget about a drink, Pizza Slut or Cinnabon.\\nTerminal 2 is quite the opposite-fast and easy to check-in and get past security. It is a BREEZE and about as stress free as you can get in the U.S. The flip side is that there is ONE bar and it is lame. So there is absolutely nothing to do with the spare time you have, having anticipated that security was going to take forever after experiencing Terminal 4. \\nSo to sum up, Terminal 4 has lots of bars and food venues that you WON'T be able to experience because it took so long to get through security. And as stressed as you are after security, it really sucks because you'll NEED a drink-but your flight's leaving in 6 minutes.\\nYou will probably be relaxed with time to kill if you use Terminal 2, but HOW you kill that time is going to be problematic.

        "Review text:\nI am shocked at how scary this place was! I had not ever been to this location, but needed a quick place to stop for food. We always like eating at the PV mall location, until it shut down. The complaint list is long; starting with food items that should be cold were actually warm, and the warm items were cold. The bins of food had other food items in them, for instance the sour cream, cheese, and butter were all almost empty but had lots of other gross items mixed in them as if they have been sitting there for hours. The ranch dressing was almost gone and some other dressings looked like they hadnt been stirred for a long time. There was food all over the counters, and the only time I saw a counter being wiped was when an employee leaned over the open containers of soup to yell at the top of her lungs back to the kitchen. The potatoes were cold and so was the macaroni and cheese. The pizza looked like a microwave pizza, undercooked and hard from sitting out for god only knows how long. We walked over to get soft serve ice cream and the area looked like a bomb had gone off, there was food everywhere! On a good note, the service was good, our server checked on us frequently and was very nice. But the unsanitary presentation of buffet style dining has my stomach churning too much to go back.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nI feel bad that I haven't written this review sooner...the manager really deserves some recognition. \\n\\nI have celiac which requires me to order gluten free food. Pei Wei provides quality gluten free options and though the gf menu is rather small, I'm always satisfied. \\n\\nA couple months ago, my little sister and I decided to call ahead to get take out. When we arrived we were told it would be about 10 minutes.\\nI'm perfectly used to waiting longer for gluten free food. I understand that it takes a couple minutes longer because the cooks have to change their gloves, change pots and pans to prevent cross contamination ect ect. So we waited maybe a minute or two over ten minutes and I really couldn't have cared less. However the manager was so very apologetic for the delay explaining that they had to remake mine because it got contaminated. Hey I'm perfectly willing to wait a couple extra minutes to not get poisoned!! I told him everything was fine and he proceeded to give me a $10 gift card just for the short delay. I didn't even make a peep about waiting and yet he made it clear that he cared and we were important and that means a lot! \\nI wish I had asked his name but I didn't :( so if you ever read this sir, thank you! \\n\\nAnd about the food...yeah it's awesome. I love the sweet and sour combo (chicken and shrimp) on white rice or the spicy chicken!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "A few hours before the event, we happened across the ad in the City Paper and decided to give it a shot.  We were excited to get there as the event said we would be making something, there would be food and music, demonstrations, live music, and a gallery.  Booking our reservations for 6pm was quick and easy over the phone; $60 for a couple.  Upon arrival, we checked in and were asked if we wanted to purchase another item to make; we were confused because we assumed that we would each get to make something.  In the end, we chose not to spend the extra $15 to make another garden float/ornament; aka a hollow glass ball.  \\n\\nWhen our 'instructor' met with us, he was very friendly but it was loud and he was very hard to hear.  He ran through everything at lightning speed and in the end, all we got to do was blow air in a tube for 10 seconds.  Had the first attempt not popped, I wouldn't even have been able to do anything!  From a teacher's standpoint, there were many other steps in the process that we should have been able to participate in; I would've been happy to sign a waiver if that is part of the issue.  Within 15 minutes, our ball was done and we were shuffled out so another couple could have their turn.\\n\\nWe then worked our way downstairs to the food and drink and there was an assortment of beer, wine, sparkling juices, veggies, fruit, cheese, and some deli meats.  The assortment was nice, as we were able to snack on the healthy side, but the beer was still warm.\\n\\nThe gallery was nice to walk through with work on display from so many talented people, the live music added to the ambiance, and the demonstrations were interesting to watch.\\n\\nIn the end, it was nice experience, but were severely let down by the make-it/take-it section of the evening (the part we were most excited for!).  It really started to bug us, when later in the evening, we saw an older couple getting to do more of the steps in the process (mind you, we aren't young kids, but young professionals).

        "I didn't want to write a negative review about this place but unfortunately I was left with no choice. I dropped off my dog for boarding the day before Thanksgiving because no other kennel had openings. I guess I probably could have understood the reason but I needed to find someone to take my dog before I left.\\n\\nWhen I picked up my dog on Sunday morning I was the only person there except for employees and it took almost 15 minutes to get my dog out of the back room. Now I'm not sure why it took this long but it just left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. This isn't my biggest issue, the issue is that my dog seems to have changed while he was at Gentle Doctor's animal hospital. \\n\\nHe's normally the most friendly, happy little dog but the past 2 days he has been skittish and has been shaking quite a bit. Not to mention that there is a noticeable dent above his nose that wasn't there before I brought him in. I really fear the worst may have happened while my dog was boarding but I certainly hope this isn't the case.\nSo I would like to give it",

It closed a coupe times in 2010, for unknown reasons. It re-opened and new management took over in '11. Now, the service and food quality has gone downhill ever since. I remember when we went in after new management took over, they manager told us \\\"Yeah, I'm gonna make it better than it used to be.\\\" Not even close! It seems the delivery & bar orders take precedence over dining room orders. We never see the same server twice, ever. The dining room table configuration is too crowded now. Our server kept telling us \\\"Your pizza is coming out right now...\\\" Right now came over an hour later for 2 pizzas. The drink refill service was poor at best. Our server asked half the table if they wanted refills, and didn't ask the other side. They gave us free desert to make up for all of it, but it didn't matter. I don't think we will be going back here much any more.\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nTo say that the office staff at Estrella Mountain Medical Group is cold, unfriendly and rude is almost an understatement. When you walk in and speak to almost anyone behind the front desk they will look at you and speak to you as though you are wasting their time. On top of that, if they are running behind, they do not make an effort to let you know. My wife had an appointment there last Monday at 4pm, and at 5pm she was called back and then waited another 20 minutes to see the doctor. My wife and I have put up with it for a while, but the experience I had this week left us looking for another doctor. \\n\\nI went in for an appointment because I was having some pain in my throat. After signing in, I was called to the front desk to verify my insurance information. The young lady behind the desk looked like she would have rather be doing anything else than helping me. She took my insurance card, compared what was on her screen, handed it back to me and said I no longer had coverage. She told me I could pay up front or I could call the insurance company to find out what was wrong. She also told me she wouldn't call them because they are usually closed after 4pm. It was 3:50pm. I rescheduled for the next day and left. I called the insurance company at about 4:10pm and they told me my coverage was just fine.\\n\\nI called back the next day to tell them that everything was fine with my insurance company and I was transferred to the woman that deals with the insurance companies. I explained the situation to her and she told me that I did not inform the young lady from the day before that I had changed insurance companies. I explained to her that the change had taken place over six months ago, and that I had given her my new insurance card for my new coverage, not my old one (I threw that one away six months ago) so she should have known. I was told that I still should have said something about the change. At this point I was getting irritated and asked her if this really mattered, basically asking her if placing blame...\n\nStars:",

They gave us the menu and came back a minute later to take our orders. It would take me at least 5 to decipher their menu. \\n\\nIn addition, one of my friends and I ordered similar pho but with slight differences in meat. One was large and the other was small.  After they brought out our food we started eating. 5 minutes later they came back to say that our bowls were mixed up.  For one thing, there is no noticeable differences between a large bowl and a small bowl. Well no use complaining about that anymore.\\n\\nThe pho quality was somewhat substandard, salty, and lacked effort.  I know its Vegas, but there are many pho restaurants in the area and I've tried one a few blocks down Spring Mountain that actually has tasty well made broth.  This place did not give a lot of meat either.  \\n\\nI can only tell you that I am not coming back here.

This crack does not influence phone function or the front screen, cameras, or any phone function. Thanks guys for telling me after I have the plastic out.\\n\\nA week later, my phone was lost/stolen after a night out. I go to geek squad and after waiting on the phone for upwards of an hour. I finally get to the deductable for the phone. It's $240. The same price as a new Galaxy with a new 2 year contract. OHHHHH and the real kickers are, it takes 2-5 business days for it to arrive AND it's a refurbished phone, not a brand new phone a flippin broken and fixed leftover. I'm beyond furious with them.

Stopped in on a Friday night around 8pm without reservations just to see how long the wait would be.  Great host at the door greeted us and was really friendly.  He said there was over an hour wait upstairs but we could try our chances downstairs where it was all open seating.  We headed downstairs, grabbed a couple glasses of wine and waited for seats to open up.  We waited quite a long time for a table and multiple groups were able to grab seats before us, so we saw a couple ladies paying their  tab and asked if we could get their seats when they were ready to leave.  We ended up talking to them for a while before they left.  When we went to sit down, a very unfriendly brunette bartender said this other couple had been waiting longer and were next on \\\"the list\\\".  The other couple was already sitting!  She gave them our seats  at the bar and someone else who had just walked in grabbed their chairs.  I'll never be back.  If there's a list, tell the door guy and offer people to put their names on it when they arrive.  And if that couple needed to sit at the bar so bad, I would have been fine with the table.  Customer service is obviously lost on this place (except the sweet door host.  Worst experience I've had in a long time.  Contrary to my efforts to calmly explain to the bartender, she did nothing to resolve the issue.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

A place where you can chill out and and stuff some salmon in peace.\\n\\nTokyo Lobby is that place.\\n\\nThe traditional rolls are always tasty, and I don't recall any individual item being more than about $10.

Curses, but you knew I'd be back anyway!\\n\\nMy only problem is that I feel the eel sauce is too sweet...reminded me of an allspice flavor as opposed to the more savory sauces I've sampled elsewhere. Also, the seating is a bit crowded and they're closed on Sunday! That alone has lost them several visits from me. STILL WORTH IT.\\n\\nNext time you're on Bell Road craving sushi, visit Tokyo Lobby and get a quality product without seeing swarms of snobs. You'll thank me later.\n\nStars:",

It's as if Hooters took over a previous establishment not big in business. The bar only seats 10 with a large square room. There r only 2 Hooters signs on the building itself. If this place wants to make better business, I suggest they move to a location more visual from Route 45. On the other hand, I noticed a fellow yelper complain about the texture of the food but it was fairly consistent for my experience. Also, this location employees pretty young ladies, after all it is a college town. Ur welcome! ;) Only 3* for mediocre-ism\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

They offered to do a maintenance/repair package that we would have used had we been able to fit out bikes into our car.\\n\\nIn the end we both came in simply to buy helmets (I'll never understand people not wearing helmets on motorcycle of bicycles especially if you are riding outside of just subdivisions). They staff never pressured us to look at new bikes. They were helpful. We got nice helmets for a reasonable price. And they didn't try and upsale the helmets either. A year from now when we are ready to commit to new bikes, we'll definitely consider coming back.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I haven't been to the E'n P in awhile, but I used to come here about once a month with a Meetup group on Sun. evenings for dinner.  I've been here both before and after the remodel, and I agree with other reviewers that, though the place looks snazzier, the food hasn't improved.  Service has always been friendly, if slow.\\n\\nIf you're looking for basic diner fare or late night munchies, the E'n P fits the bill well.  Having said that, you can tell that most of the food here is frozen or straight out of a container.  I've never ordered any of the breakfast specials, which seem to be quite popular, but I have ordered sandwiches and entrees, and they've all been pretty salty and flavorless, akin to cafeteria food.  The salad bar is usually a pretty safe bet, and the one thing they seem to get right is the potato soup, which comes with it.  Thinking that diner desserts are usually good even if the food isn't that great, I once tried a slice of strawberry cream pie once at the Waterfront location, but unfortunately, it failed to impress me, being of similar quality to the food.\\n\\nE'n P is a great place to come with kids, older relatives, large groups that include picky eaters, and drunk people.  Other than that, you'd do well to pass it up and explore the plethora of better and more interesting dining options in the neighborhood. 2.5 stars, only because I think the smiley cookies are cute.

Not a lot of seating, but the morning I was there most people got take out; so, we didn't have a hard time snagging one of the three booths (there are two are three small tables as well).

I'm not overly impressed by the place, but it makes for a nice meal if you're in the Paw Creek area (85 and Little Rock Rd.).  There's an open \\\"veranda\\\" for dining (read: a dining room with out doors or windows attached on the front) that was a nice touch on a day like today.  Fast, cheap, and loaded with salt, what else could you ask from a local Mexican joint?\\n\\nThey have all the regular dishes you would find on a menu in a down-home Mexican place, plus lunches specials for about $5-$6.  I got the Speedy Gonzales, an enchilada, taco, and rice for a respectable $5.75.  The service was rather impersonal and task-focused, but maybe it was just one of those days.   I agree with Tonya that the sketch factor of  restaurants like these \\\"raise the stakes\\\": you'll either discover a hidden treasure or the Bates motel.  Miguel's, however, wasn't either one.

        "Review: Grape Street is not for everyone. On this dining outing, as before, the place was very crowded and filled with the chatter of diners plus added music mixed by a DJ. You almost had to shout to be heard by your table-mates, and we were as far away from the speakers as one could be. \\n\\nGood service was lacking this time, but that largely depends on one's luck of the draw. Our server never announced any of the specials; fortunately I had checked the blackboard before he arrived to see what they were. When I asked for butter for the Italian bread, the equivalent of two pats arrived. Twice more I had to ask for additional butter, and each time only enough for two applications was brought to the table. And, vinegar and oil were never offered. Our first loaf of bread was cool and undistinguished, but the second was very hot and tasty. While the service was professional it was not very friendly or attentive. We waited at least 30 minutes between completing the salad course and the arrival of our entrees. And, when they did arrive, they were all barely lukewarm. The other 3 members of my party gutted it out but I complained and asked for my veal to be heated up. Why spend good money and not enjoy what you are eating if it only needs reheating? \\n\\nAt first our waiter took issue with my claim that the food was almost cold, touching the bottom of the plate and noting that it was hot. I invited him to try the food itself, since the temperature of the plate was largely irrelevant. But he declined my offer, and took my plate away. Based on how long we waited for our entrees, I believe that it was largely this server's fault that our food was not hot, because the plates probably sat waiting to be picked up and delivered for an unreasonably long time. \\n\\nIn 5 minutes our server returned with a smoking, quite hot new batch of Veal Parmesan. I was content! It was not necessary to give me new veal cutlets but that's what the restaurant did. I could tell the scallops of veal were new, because all 4 large patties were intact and...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I bought a pair of shoes from Dee's. I was starting a new dance class and was excited about it! I was a little concerned about my final selection because of an injury, but the saleswoman assured me I could exchange them if they weren't too worn. I wore the shoes once to a dance class and they were just too small to dance in. When I went in to exchange them for a bigger size, I was told they wouldn't exchange them once they were worn. This surprised me. So, I talked to Jamie, the owner or manager, who said she would check things out with her employee and call me back that day, but based on her employee's notes, I had been notified of their no return, no exchange once worn policy. I didn't receive a call back that day or the next.  Even if this is their policy, it wasn't clearly explained, and they didn't follow up. Now I have a pair of shoes I can't wear and need to buy another pair. I won't be buying them there. It's so short sighted. These shoes probably cost them $20 wholesale.

        "I've been a customer for over 5 years and feel Verizon has a long way to go when it comes to customer service. I hate to give anyone a bad review but after the problems I've had at that store and the amount of time I had to spend to correct them, I have to pass it along.\\nHad a Blackberry that was replaced 4 times in 6 months. RIM told me the design was problematic and they were telling people to get a replacement with a newer model. Not naming names but I had one girl tell me my phone wasn't broken and to \\\"come back when it's really broken\\\" then another gave me completely incorrect information and that's just on 2 of 46 visits I made regarding that phone.\\nI finally had to file a complaint with the FCC for fraud because I was paying for service on a phone that didn't work. It was then that I was contacted by a corporate rep. They have an entirely different attitude and capability working with people. In the store I have been treated so poorly that I refuse to step foot in there ever again. I have found the same problem at other stores. No one seems to know how to work with the public or how to actually resolve a problem for a customer.\\nIt's too bad these employees aren't properly trained or perhaps don't care and because of that I will not renew my Verizon contract when it's up. Even if they have the best network, it's not worth being treated like garbage when you're paying an arm and leg for service.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

The meal started with the lobster mac&chz and stuffed hush puppies as appetizers. The good news were that the apps were presented well and very tasty.  The bad news is that they were the best part of the meal. The m&c had good texture and balance but was highly seasoned and both my dining partner and I felt that it was too salty. The hush puppies were spot on. Loaded with shrimp & crawfish in a delicate white sauce with toasted onion slivers. Yummy! The crispy texture of the hush puppies, paired with the creamy sauce was just perfect.\\n\\nAs for the entr\\u00e9es, well that's a whole different story. I had the short ribs with the risotto. The ribs were cooked perfectly but the risotto was crunchy ( and I don't mean al dente) which made it difficult to enjoy the meal....I'm not interested in just eating a hunk of meat.  My companion had the Red Snapper which was served over jambalaya which was also lackluster. All in all, it was just oh-Kay. \\n\\nFor dessert I had the apple pie cheesecake. It clearly had not been made the same day because it had developed that \\\"skin\\\" on it that comes from keeping things refrigerated but uncovered. It was not edible.  \\n\\nThis was $100 meal that was more like a 2 for $20 deal at Chili's or TGI Friday's. If I ever go back to this place again it will be for the apps only. Save your money.\n\nStars:",

The staff are not as graciously friendly as in years past and there are not as many helpful folks around to greet you and direct you.  Getting lost at Wigwam is EASY.  GettIing help is not easy anymore.\\n\\nThe resort is still beautiful and is aging graciously.  I've been visiting the Wigwam for more than 20 years and am delighted it is still here, nestled away in the heart of Litchfield Park.\\n\\nI want to preface this comment by saying I attend several charity dinners each year at various hotels around the valley.  I have been to events at the Wigwam in the past and have always been amazed by the great service and great food. They've always been a cut above the rest.  This year I have been to two events at Wigwam and both left me a little disappointed.  Last night, however, I was more than disappointed, I left annoyed enough to come here to Yelp and write a review.\\n\\nWe attended a sit down dinner event at the resort last night.  I was astonished in a not good way at several things.  First of all, the temps inside the ballroom were very warm, too warm for mingling around a congested drink station area.  The cash bar was too expensive ($4.75 for bottled water - even in the desert that is ridiculous).  The restrooms were beautiful but oddly lacking in soap dispensers.  Maybe someone stole them?\\n\\nThe worst part of the evening was not only the food but the serving staff.  Dinner was a slab of meat, perhaps sirloin, resting on some broccoli and carrots which were seated on top of a large scoop of potatoes.  All of this was rather thrown in front of the guests by the harried staff.  The servers were abrupt and all business.  No time for discussion of any kind, no time to ask for anything.\\n\\nWhen I was able to get my knife through the hide of the beef I realized it was bloody and red - probably cooked to no more than rare inside, although the exterior was seared nearly black.

But the soup was wonderful! The atmosphere was really cool too, totally serene. My friends all had a great time and they said their food was excellent. The layout of ordering was a bit confusing, because we came in on the cusp of the lunch express and the dinner. But we figured it out!

        "I agree with what others have to say here. The shop is very nice but the owner will try everything to extract money from you. I went there about 4 years ago to become a certified scuba diver. After initially signing in the owner convinced me to buy some gear which till now I haven't used. After the initial few classes he started telling me I should buy my own tank and BCD because my life depends on it. The trick he employs is  that he keeps some really very old almost broken down equipment for training and says that unless you buy his shiny new equipment you will have to get certified in the old equipment. The reason he gives is that if you go to any of the other scuba sites they have this very old equipment and it is better to train in that unless I buy equipment from him. Once a person dropped in to class to return a leaking cylinder which that person rented from him. He then started telling me this is why I should buy my own cylinder since the person had to come back from his vacation because of his leaking cylinder and this wouldn't have happened if he had bought and maintained his own tank. To make things worse there was very little training since most of the time he was trying to sell his overpriced equipment. He also tried to sell me a vacation package which he and his girlfriend was going to and told me that other people in the class were also going to(there were really no other people in the class). The vacation was of course overpriced and I felt he was trying to get me to pay for all 3 of us. I very soon cut my losses and left the classes and got certified at another place where the divers told me that this guy had spent time in prison. Never go here.\nSo I would like to give it",

The bar is nice and it has a nice patio which was busy but not overly crowded for a Saturday night.  The bar tender was right there ready to take my order.  I asked for the wine list and he presented it and gave me a minute to make my choice.  Ok, they could update the wine list a bit.  I know AZ has some fine local wines and, in my opinion, those should be on the menu as well as a few nice California wines.  Maybe I am just jaded because I am used to some of the finest California wines.  I just thought the list was lacking.  After a glass of wine, I decided to order some dinner.  I had the miso sake marinated sea bass.  It was delicious!!!  It was tender and flakey and had a wonderful flavor.  It was server with fried rice and veggies and both were good, the veggies nice and crisp.  I don't eat like this often so I enjoyed my sea bass and getting to relax watching a baseball game.  The bartender was attentive and asked several times if I needed anything.  I was good.....I had a nice adult beverage in an adult setting which is something I had not done in at least 7 years.

And they don't even have a reason for it? House keeping does a good job, that's why I gave 2stars. Valet, says it's free for hotel guest, but god forbid you don't tip em!! They have major attitude and I almost got into a fight with one, to the point that I didn't feel comfortable using their valet option. And all the staff there except Lizz don't seem to care about shit!! I will not be coming back to this place!\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review: I'm not going to say that this is the best buffet in Vegas... But to be honest, for $9.99 a person for dinner, it's pretty dang good. You must have a players card to get that price (FYI, one persons card will cover up to 2 people). There is a huge variety of dishes (American, Asian, Italian, Mexican) but I would skip the Asian cuisine (it's hard to find good Asian food in Vegas... With the exception of sushi). I didn't try the prime rib but my dad seemed to enjoy it (though he and my mom REALLY enjoyed the collard greens). The albondigas soup was decent but not up to Mexican standards haha. The Mexican lasagna was delicious (it was kind of like a mix between tamales and enchiladas, good combo). The salad bar was SMALL. I was sad that there was no blue cheese. The mashed potatoes were good and the Chinese chicken nuggets were basically nuggets dipped in sweet and sour sauce. This buffet has an ice cream bar (pretty good but how can you go wrong with ice cream??) in addition to the desserts section (good variety of cakes, pies, and cookies). The service was good (all Vegas hotels have excellent service for the most part). Overall if you're starving at Sam's Town and its before 9PM, this is the place to go! (They stop serving hot food at 9:20PM, and they kick people out at 9:30PM... Of course this is only if you came in before 9PM). Happy eating!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I needed a ton of produce and meat. \\n\\nI bought a 10 pound bag of potatos, got home and they ALL had eyes, they were soft to the touch and green. I bought 3 pears, they had some bad bruising on the inside that wasn't easily detected from the outside (otherwise I wouldn't have bought them). I bought 1 sweet potato, started to peel it and it had black spots all over it. \\n\\nWho ever is running the produce dept over there is not on top of things. \\n\\nThe meat selection was good. Better then my close by Fry's. \\n\\nI liked the wide aisles, but it was hard to find things. \\n\\nI will stick to my Fry's and Safeway that are much closer and don't sell bad produce.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I didn't know much about roller derby, so I was excited to attend and learn more about the sport.\\n\\nA quick diversion, if I may?  \\n\\nHoly. Cats. Roller Derby athletes are the real deal.  To see a pack of people skating in unison around a small track, bunched together in a tight group is incredibly impressive.  I don't think I'd make it a single lap... Add to this a myriad of strategy, speed, complex maneuvers, and some significant hits/blocks/impacts, and you've got a very serious sport.  It takes core strength, coordination, brains, brawn, and guts.  I have massive respect for anyone who participates in this sport!\\n\\nAnywho, back to the rink itself.\\n\\nWhat a disaster.  It's completely rundown and neglected - from the parking lot to the lounge areas to the rink to the roof to the lighting - it's all in dire shape.\\n\\nThe parking lot is riddled with potholes and missing sections of asphalt.  The rink reaks of old sweat and body odor.  The carpet is in shambles.  The rink itself is missing chunks from the surface - I could see sections of OSB (oriented strand board) exposed all over the place... I saw one large \\\"gash\\\" in the rink that had to be 16-18\\\" long.\\n\\nThe drop-tile roofing shows signs of water damage, mold, and other issues.  The lighting fixtures are largely broken; there are globes hanging around the rink, and most are damaged in some fashion or another.\\n\\nI feel bad for anyone who has to skate here... I can't believe they let this place get rundown to as bad as it appears to be.  It couldn't take much to fix the ceilings, the flooring, and to Febreeze the place... \\n\\nOn a positive note, the bathrooms were clean.  :-)\\n\\nI'll be back to watch additional Roller Derby activities, but I'm not sure I'd attend for an open skate or anything on my own.\n\nStars:",

        "Visiting Pittsburgh from out of town, so naturally I asked my hosts to take me to Primanti's (and they were happy to oblige).  We went to the one at \\\"PPG.\\\" The place was busy but not crowded on a Friday night.  The menu was on the wall along with murals of Pittsburgh's finest sports starts.\\n\\nOur server was quick and efficient and we never were in need of refills or anything else.\\n\\nI got the Pitts-burgher cheese steak and we tried an order of the Smallman Street Fries.  The fries were truly loaded.  The chili had a nice kick to it and there was literally an ice cream scoop of sour cream on top.  However, the fries were actually seasoned that well and were under done in my opinion.  That didn't bode well for the fries on the sandwich, but I kept my hopes high.\\n\\nThe sandwich comes out and its a monster.  I love the italian bread, the beef patty and cheese, the slaw was good (shredded cabbage, not like southern cole slaw).  Everything was fresh but, again, the fries were the worst part.  Underdone, underseasoned.  Definitely my least favorite part.\\n\\nNonetheless, I would definitely return because I want to try some of the other menu items.  I've heard double-meat is the way to go.  I'm intrigued.\nSo I would like to give it",

It wasn't all that bad but that's mainly because we didn't spend too much time in our room as it was. \\n\\nWhile we never made it down to the pool I'd say that's probably their only redeeming quality. (Cool fire pits, water falls and lighted pools at night). \\n\\nThe room service was fast but the food was barely edible. The freezer burned fries were nuked in the microwave for about two minutes and arrived floppy and cold. The chicken was smothered with melted Kraft singles cheese and the bread was stale and tasteless. \\n\\nGreat that this stay was free but I'd never in a million years pay to stay here!

        "Review text:\nQuick review: Stopped in for lunch today, with the intention of sampling their Friday Fish special. $7 gets you 2 pieces of deep fried cod, fries, slaw, roll, and soda.  Fish was solid - nicely done, especially for the price and speed.\\n\\nDetailed review:\\n\\nI'd never visited the Middleton Sport Bowl prior to today, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  We arrived exactly at noon, parked, and made our way to the bar, where we found two seats and were promptly greeted by a bartender.\\n\\nWe both ordered the lunch special - 2 piece deep fried cod plate with fries, slaw, tartar, dinner roll, and soda.  The bartender took our order and came back with a complimentary bowl of popcorn, which was a nice surprise.\\n\\nPlates arrived about 10 minutes later - the fish was appropriately sized, as were the fries - no imbalance, and portions were fair.\\n\\nThe fish itself had a flavorful beer batter that was a little thicker than what you'll typically find at most places, but it was delicious and I welcomed the extra crunch.\\n\\nInside, the fish itself was a tad watery with just a hint of grease - not anything outrageous, but just enough to sense that it was there.  Flavor of the fish was incredibly mild; the batter stole some of its thunder.  \\n\\nThe fries were excellent - battered-style and straight cut.  I'm told the slaw and tartar were \\\"average.\\\"  Dinner roll was hard and dry.\\n\\nTotal lunch bill for two: $14.64, and we were in-and-out within 35 minutes.  Totally acceptable and a good lunch, all things considered.\\n\\nMiddleton Sport Bowl = NEUTRAL\\n\\nFood = 2.75 to 3 stars (average; not bad, not spectacular)\\nService = 3.5 stars (prompt and friendly)\\nValue = 4 stars \\nMISC = 3 stars (actually seemed to be a nice bowling alley/bar)\\n\\nSummary: Not a win, nor a fail.  I'd go back for the fish at lunch, and will definitely be back to sample other foods - the sandwiches looked really good.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review: First of all, there's hardly any information online on hours and rental prices so after getting lost for a little bit trying to find the place we ended up getting there at 2:45. We get there only to find out that they only take cash (information that is not available on the website) and that we would have to drive 7 miles down the road to the nearest ATM and be back by the time they close rentals at 3:30 (also not on the website). We did that and got back at 3:15 only to find that they decided to close early for the day after specifically telling us that they would be open until 3:30. \\n\\nWe essentially wasted 3 hours of our time and a lot of money in gas and all we got were coupons for $10 rentals in the future. WE DIDN'T EVEN GET TO GO DOWN THE RIVER. Waste of time, waste of a day, horrible customer service. I would rate 0/5 if I could, but because they are the only game in town I suppose I have no choice to go back \\n\\nSide note: $17 for a tube rental is a ridiculous price for a piece of rubber and a 5 minute bus ride.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

We thought :\\\"well there must be something wrong with the microphone or their speaker box and continued on to pay. As we reached the payment window a man was at the window asking for $7 for the supreme meal, we said, \\\"no, we ordered the 12pc chicken with dirty rice, you know your supreme package with all the fixings.  He walks away waves his hand and yells at someone to come take the order right, this young african american comes up, asks why we dont want the supreme meal box and continually shuts the service window on us as we are trying to tell her we ordered the family meal. She turns around slams the window shut again and throws her hands up and walks off with this attitude!  Never comes back or to tell us what the price of the meal is going to be...she just abandoned us at the pick up window!

        "Review: Went to lunch on a Friday afternoon here. Since I have been to Tacos El Gordo so many times I wanted to give these guys another try since the first time was the Taco Trek UYE months ago (Thanks Nelson Q!).\\n\\nI was pretty hungry so I was thinking the standard Carne Asada Burrito would fill me up based on the tacos I got last time. If you  refer to my pic, the burrito was not all that big. In fact, if you don't tell them you want it with everything (which is cheese, guacamole, and sour cream for an extra 1.50), all that's in there is just the meat and beans. So for 5.75 you get a tiny burrito. Add the 1.50 just so you can a little more stuffing in it. I paid a total of 7.84 with tax. Now I don't know about you guys, but lots of other places would give you a huge burrito for that price. So yes, I was a bit disappointed.\\n\\nWhile I was eating, I noticed a majority of the patrons were Caucasian. Weird. If you go to Tacos El Gordo, its mainly Mexicans. So what am I missing? Are you telling me that Los Tacos is more of an Americanized establishment? Don't get me wrong. To me there's nothing wrong with that. It just didn't look right. \\n\\nSome other things I noticed: They don't have a salsa bar. They do have salsa verde in squeeze bottles on just about every table. I guess you have to ask them for other sauces on the side if you don't like the green sauce which I thought is pretty good.\\n\\nNext couple of visits I will try the Shrimp Ceviche Tostada because I saw somebody order it and scarf it down. I was so tempted to interrupt their first bite just so I can ask to take a picture of it. LOL.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nThis shop has an \\\"absolutely no returns\\\" policy, and there is a damn reason for that. They stock low-quality items that malfunction or break, and when you complain, they wave you off by blaming everything on your incompetency and \\\"the use of wrong tools\\\". Basically, they are pinching to every dollar they could get today, taking advantage of scarce business competition and the volatility of the student population. Why would they want to strive for customer satisfaction, if a year or two from now you'll be gone from this little town forever?  So they don't.\\n\\n     I bought a freewheel remover tool from Durst: it's nothing but a 1-inch nut with some special threading on it. They charged me $10 for a nut. Overpriced as it is, I thought to myself, As long as it does its job, it's a good tool to have.\\n    Well, it didn't do it's job. The nut was defective: so shallow that it fell almost all the way into the freewheel, sticking out only by about 1/8 inch to grip on with a wrench. It was also made of unhardened metal, so the nut's edges  smudged like clay, without removing the freewheel.   \\n     When I brought it back, the workers and then the management tried convincing me that a large  professional-grade adjustable wrench was the wrong tool, and I should have used a vise. Since when a wrench is a wrong tool for turning a nut?!?! By the way, the instructions on the packaging explicitly read \\\"remove by... using either an adjustable wrench or ... a vise\\\" . So, excuse me for being a student on a budget and not being able to afford to own a workbench with a vise! \\n\\n     While I understand that Durst Cycles did not make the tool, there is nothing worse a business selling shitty merchandise and then fooling its customers into believing that the failures are somehow their own fault. This  is what earns the lowest rating for this review.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review: RESULT: The parent company Frias resolved my issue. They took the time to research and find the cab and driver using our credit card information. They did a full investigation and although I don't know if the driver got reprimanded, they were very diligent in the follow up process. I guess I would take an Ace Cab again, but next time I'll double check to be sure I don't leave anything behind.\\n\\nEDITED: Below is my initial post. One day after posting I was contacted by the parent company and they are looking into the situation. I appreciate their effort and I will let everyone know if anything comes of it.\\n\\nORIGINAL POST: Driver was rude and a thief!!! We left our ipad in the car and so I left a message on their lost and found number and never got a response. However, we got a call today from a guy who bought the ipad from the taxi driver. Sounds like a scam, but no matter how it went down the driver did NOT turn in the ipad and the company never got back to me. I understand Ace is one of many cab companies ran by one parent company. I would (& will) avoid them all if this is how they conduct business. At least follow up. I realize it's difficult to monitor all the drivers, but at least pretend to care.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I came back 20 minutes later when they said it would be done and as I rode away, the back tire rhythmically rubbed against the back brake.  When I returned and told them about it, I was told the back wheel was not true.  It was true for the whole short week since I purchased it from Walmart.  I plan to take it to their competitor (Landis) and pay the extra $15-$25) to have the wheel put back to the straight condition it was in when I brought it to Slippery Pig in the first place.

Marjele's has a nice vibe so if you haven't been or  you're looking for your next bar, you should definitely give Marjele's a shot ;)\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "We went here for breakfast.  I had Colorado green chili pork special with an egg on hash browns. The wife had the basic breakfast special; egg, hash browns, bacon & toast. The first bite of my Colorado green chili special was alright, but the farther I got into the more I noticed that the hash browns were raw.  It was also pretty bland with no flavor.  The coffee is free as long as you spend $4 on food..and there is a reason it's free, it was pretty bad.  The bacon on my wife's plate was fantastic, thick cut bacon done just right. It wasn't too crisp and not too chewy.  I did notice a sign in the window that they were hiring a cook...I can see why. It was $11 for our food which is a pretty good deal even if I didn't finish my food.  There were some other things on the menu I want to try, such as the stuffed crispy french toast!  So we will give this place at least one more try.  There was only one waitress and several of the tables were dirty, but at least the bathroom was clean.\nSo I would like to give it",

And the menu only adds to the manly atmosphere, meat and more meat.  But I shouldn't complain because I love steak and this place can serve it up very well.  Of course it's kind of no frills, but it's the food that's the important part.  And the food here will satisfy if you have a deep craving for red meat like I did.  It had been forever since I had a good steak and it tasted really good.  Cooked very nicely, and the side dishes were excellent as well.  The service was really the best part though.

It should have been smooth and creamy - almost buttery - when you get the good fresh stuff. I've actually had better supermarket sushi, and Sakura Sushi in Kingman, AZ is better by far, which is pretty sad. I should have known that a restaurant named after a famous Sushi guru would be nothing but a poser. I should have just gotten sushi from Whole Foods, that would have been fresher and tasted better.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

By the time it was my turn, I ordered a blended chai tea latte. I would have gotten something to eat, like the double chocolate brownie, a berry coffee cake or even a banana bread. They were out of everything, except for carrot cake, which I don't like. Next, I waited twenty minutes for my drink. You know what? I paid $5.36 to wait for my drink to get to me eventually, and that is unsatisfactory! Also, slow wi-fi.

        "I read all the reviews before buying the Groupon, so I knew what to expect. Since I am a master procrastinator, I waited until it was almost expired to make my appointment. Luckily the girl was able to fit me in with a few days to spare! They had the girls team up with Jennifer doing my mani and Kelly did my pedi. Both girls did a good job, they were friendly and it took about and hour and a half. My two complaints would be 1) It was a little awkward because I sat in a chair facing sideways for the pedi and turned my torso for the mani, I saw they had a room with couches for the ladies just getting pedis and it looked more comfortable. 2) I didn't think they had a good enough color selection for me, as I prefer nude shades. They explained to me that after I used my Groupon, I had one more discounted visit and then I would be paying full price, which is not nearly as expensive as going to a salon. I don't have my nails done very often, but I hope to be back soon!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nThis was the 1st sports arena in the Charlotte area & used to be called Independence Arena before naming rights were sold out for sponsorships. And being the oldest arena in town, you can definitely tell from both the outside & inside.\\n\\nThe arena isn't very big, with only around 10,000 seats, & no luxury or suite boxes. The amenities inside aren't anything special either, as they're all from a different age & time. And with the neighborhood surrounding the arena, it's easy to see why this arena isn't very popular. While you do have Ovens Auditorium & the Charlotte Convention Center on either side of the arena, the neighborhood is in shambles & you wouldn't want to do too much walking alone at night through here.\\n\\nAs for events here, the main attraction used to be the Charlotte Checkers, but they have since moved into the uptown TimeWarner Cable Arena. So as of right now, I'm not really sure what they hold in this place anymore.\\n\\nSo don't expect to be heading to Cricket Arena anytime soon, because it only gets the occasional event. If you do end up finding something that's going on here, then the parking is very easy as the parking lot is huge. But other than that, Cricket is passed its prime, which is a shame, as their signature event has moved into its new uptown home.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

However, since I was in the neighborhood around lunch-time, I decided to stop in and give them a try.

This consisted of blackened wahoo in a kiwi-pineapple fajita sauce, with lettuce, tomato, cheese, & a honey wasabi sauce. \\n\\nThe dish came with 2 tacos and your choice of a side dish.  The fish was perfectly cooked and had a nice balance of flavors. The tacos had a good amount of fish and tasted really good. I was a little worried that they might go overboard on the wasabi, but it was just the right amount.  For the side dish,  I went with the black beans & rice.  The side dish was ok, but the black beans could have used a little more seasoning. \\n\\nThe chips on my visit were fresh & crispy.  The salsa seemed to be made in house and had a nice flavor but was mostly corn and could have used a little more tomato and a little more heat.  \\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed my lunch and had good service, so I would definitely go back.

Most cafes that offer quick bites/sandwiches like Panera, Einstein, Subway, even Dunkin Donuts offer free wi-fi and convenient outlets for charging your laptop, ipad, etc... this place doesn't have wi-fi nor a single outlet near any of the booths. The atmosphere in general seemed a little shabby, not very suitable for doing anything other than stuffing your face and watching cheesy game shows on TV.\\n\\nFor being so close to the university and when considering the direction most small cafes/sandwich shops are heading, I feel it's a couple steps behind its competition.

It is small in stature and in options.  I am talking about the lack of an all you can eat soup and salad bar.  I was looking forward to a nice self-made and customized salad and a bowl of French Onion Soup.  I got none of that.  I ended up with Mahi Mahi tacos and rice pilaf.  Tender meaty fish, salsa and fresh sqeezed lime work well together.  No doubt about that.  It was very good but I was disappointed that the salad bar was non-existent.  My dad was too.  But we were there and made the most of the situation.  The whole family left satisfied and with pie in the waiting.  How can you go wrong with Marie Callender's pie?  You really can't.  So for good food and excellent service, bravo.  But for the missing salad bar and a small location that does not feel homey like a good Marie Callender's, I'm sorry but I can't give more stars.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I booked 1 room for 2 nights, had an emergency / last-minute need to cancel/change my reservation and they refused to refund anything (according to \\\"Paula\\\"). I can understandably pay for the first night we didn't stay, but requiring me to pay for the second when we never checked in, thus aren't in the room, and have been trying to cancel quite early on in the day is bad business.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I was drawn here by the history of the place as well as the iconic sign posted on yelp.  The sign is gone, and any air of nostalgia from yesteryear has gone with it. \\n\\n I landed here in search of a burger after being turned away at tommys down the street (they are remodeling).  The prices are incredibly low so I decided to give it a shot with a dollar burger and dollar fry.  While the burger was small (like mcds) - it tasted like Whataburger.  It was good enough for me to order a second and make it a double!  \\n\\nIf I lived in the area I would definitely choose this place over other fast food joints - the frys are pretty good.  But it's not the kinda place I would drive across town for.  \\n\\nOverall - great value,  decent food.   If you remember the original Lennys before they tore it down - thats the vibe here.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I dealt with Brett and Tim at the Tempe location and not only were they familiar with the model vehicle, but they new exactly what had been improperly installed on the lift causing the handling problem, they even performed a four wheel alignment in house!

        "All three of my stars go to the excellent, fresh, delicious taste of the carne asada, salsas, and guacamole. I can honestly say this place does have some great authentic tasting flavors. On the other hand....\\n\\nInstead of going inside I decided to slip through the drive-thru since there were no cars in sight. I'm guessing the place must have been bumping inside, because I did wait a LONG time to get my food at the drive-thru. Instead of getting tacos, I decided to go for the carne asada torta with a side of chips and salsa (holy crap, they give you a huge bag of chips btw). The lady over the intercom for the drive-thru was hard to hear, and I know she was asking me if I wanted all the extras on my torta, well hell, I said yes - but be warned you will get an extra charge! However, it is worth it.\\n\\nUnfortunately my torta was mooshy-mooshed by the time I got home! :( Not all of it mind you, but a good portion of the bread had just soaked up the guac and juicy meat leaving a messy bread pile wrapped inside of foil. I did salvage a majority of it though. The salvaged part was delish! So word of warning: do not get the torta to go, especially if you got all the extras put on it. And note: I only live about 5 minutes away from this place, so it's not like I had to drive 15 mins home with it sitting in my car.\\n\\nLastly, I must say even though they gave me a ton of chips, they were cold! Even Taco Bell serves me warm chips through the drive-thru window! *sigh* So, when I got home I warmed up the chips and they were very, very good and SALTY! Mmmm. Plus they gave me a TON of pico de gallo for dipping, but I don't like cilantro. I opted to dip my chips in the SPICY red sauce they gave me with my torta.\\n\\nThis place is authentic and it is incredibly popular. Unfortunately my experience was not-so-good. I do want to go back and try the tacos though! And next time perhaps I will dine-in instead of hitting up the drive-thru.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Exactly the type of fish sandwich you'd want. Comes with the option of onions and pickles on top.\\n\\nBar and restaurant was decently packed for a 5pm weeknight.

I had ordered fries with my burger, only to have the burger served w/o the fries.  With receipt in hand, I brought this to the cashiers attention.  She acknowledged the over sight and reordered my fries.   I finished my burger while waiting for the rest of my order.   Which never came!   I requested to speak to the manager.

The food is excellent; it used to be just pretty good, but I've noticed it getting better and better as of late. The hot-n-sour soup is ridiculously good, and if you like sweet Chinese, the Schezuan chicken is delicious. Portion-size is great for the price as well; I can usually feed my family of 4 for $40 or less, with enough left over to have for lunch the next day.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Yes, I know.  I'm probably one of the few people that has rated this place with two stars.\\n\\nBut let me explain.  My friends and I wanted to try this place out and had high hopes.  I haven't heard of many vegetarian/vegan places in Pittsburgh so I expected to have some awesome vegetarian food.  However, from the get go, our host was absolutely terrible.  He did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward.  There was obviously room in the restaurant for the four of us but he had to \\\"look in the back\\\" to see if there was room.  One of the other servers eventually sat us in a clearly empty table that we could have picked out for ourselves.  Our first host came back, reiterated the same thing the server told us, but never gave us menus.  I had to go out of my way to ask for menus about five or ten minutes after we had been seated.\\n\\nTo be fair, our assigned server was very nice.  She was friendly and approachable.  But of course, our food came and mine was cold.  The potatoes in the hash I ordered was stale, old and cold and had such a small accompanying serving of bread.  Also, our utensils weren't given to us until after our food was served.  I know I may be sounding like a little bit of a snob but utensils should be expected before the food arrives.  Not to be completely biased, the rest my party had decent food.  It just wasn't anything special.  Definitely not worth $12 for brunch.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I will not be coming back to this place.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

They had never tried Bonterra and joined us based on our recommendation.  The food, what there was of it, was good.  The portions were embarrassing!  The salad  was tiny.  The entrees looked more like an appetizers.  Two small slices of meat over a tablespoon of mashed potatoes, a few ounces of salmon over 6 snap peas and a teaspoon of couscous.  The desert was a joke.  A teaspoon of ice cream with 3 small, stale cookies.  The service was terrible. It took two hours to eat this snack and the server never checked on us.

The staff was friendly.\\nI was satisfied with the experience, but not wowwed.  That could be a result of the strip-mall location, lack of ambiance, or lack of authentic feel.  Regardless, the food was good and I'd go back for lunch or a quick/cheap sushi night.\\n\\nHowever, for a date or special outing, Nikko would provide better ambiance.\n\nStars:",

We also ordered edamame and seaweed salad, both of which were served just the way we liked it.\\n\\nA note about the delivery:  First, they were fast!  (I hate waiting for food and appreciate this!)  Second, they separated the hot and the cold food.  How great is that??  One bag for the sushi and seaweed salad and another for the noodles and edamame.

Within 6 months the couch started tearing at the seam where the pillow and faux leather are sewed, staples popping out, and springs popping. After coming out and sewing the seam, the tear become much worse the way they sewed too high up on the faux leather. After them trying to repair several times, they now say costumer abuse, too much use, there is a rip in back (which there is not) etc etc.  After much complaining they offered for me to re-select but I had to pay 30%, full taxes, and another warranty. My original couch I purchased was discontinued (wonder why) so another couch like it would cost me $600. Warranry says that if they cant repair they will replace the cost of original purchas. \\n\\nDo NOT buy from the Room Store!

Very casual and service is at the counter - they call your name when yours is ready.  Nothing is fabulous, but everything I've had (which is a big selection because I work nearby) is at least palatable, which is loads above most office park cantinas.  They serve Starbuck's coffee all day.  They do not have a grill, so everything hot is from a sandwich press, boiled, or from what looks like a mini deep fryer.  To their credit, they seldom try items that are only good grilled (hamburgers), and do a decent job with the equipment they have.  \\nLines can be long, with waits up to 15 minutes between 11:45 - 12:15, so time your visit accordingly.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nI went in with my mother and a close friend to top off what was a fantastic girls day. It started off a little rocky with one of the pedicure chairs being broken. That wasn't too much of a problem, they switched me to another chair when it came available. After waiting quite some time to get my nails done, I was very happy with the outcome. And the wait was not a problem because we were in high spirits and they were under staffed (not their fault). The problem comes with how they handled business when my friend was unhappy with her nails. She got the gel colors ($20 extra to her mani/pedi) and when they were finished, the color was faded in some areas, and didn't even cover her entire nail. She wanted to just alert the nail technician that she was unhappy, and that she didn't have time to get them redone because they take to long and it was time to pick up her son from daycare. The lady became extremely rude and insulted. She then agreed to give my friend $10 off since she was unhappy, then 2 minutes later changed her mind for no reason at all. They were finally talked down a little bit, but it was such a hassle and they assured her that her nails were NOT messed up. My friend gets her nails done all the time and they never look like that. I have enjoyed this place for years and this experience, and the way my friend was treated puts a bad taste in my mouth. I may come back but it is highly unlikely and I will NEVER be helped by the technician my friend had. The gentleman and the young girl with the really long hair were great. The older woman has no sense of customer service.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

The drinks are overpriced and seem to lack, well, alcohol.  Some of the menu items are good, others merely seem like a good idea at the time.  \\n\\nCase in point:  The Big Unit, a 1.5 foot long hot dog served rarely enough that the wait staff celebrates by sounding a buzzer when one is served.  Unfortunately I wanted onions and Relish with mine, which they tried to settle with relish packets.  I don't know if you've ever tried to spread 10 relish packets on a foot and a half long hot dog before, but it's not really a reasonable proposition.  (And of course, once you've finished 2/3rds of a 1.5 foot long hot dog, it honestly just isn't fun to eat anymore.)\\n\\nAs long as you can avoid the more ridiculous menu items the food is actually pretty excellent, if somewhat pricey.\\n\\nThe premises have 4 extremely large Big Screen televisions above the bar, a no-name brand ATM machine, smoking allowed outside away from entrances, excessively large t-shirt selection, and two levels of indoor seating as well as outdoor seating.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: I checked into the Hampton on a Labor Day weekend. There was no long line, and no check in fuss. The receptionist was kind, and quickly executed the process. The lobby was not as fancy as the bigger hotels, nor furnished with floral arrangements,  but I was impresses nonetheless. They kept the lobby very clean, organized, and inviting.\\n\\nMy room was located on the 1st floor, and it was the best floor to be on! It was close to the gym, pool, lobby, and parking. \\n\\nThis hotel offers many amenities. Free internet in the room, free internet in the business center 24 hr, free fresh coffee in the lobby 24 hr, fitness center, laundry room, and my favorite-free breakfast buffet 6-10am. And you won't be disappointed with the food either.\\n\\nThe rooms are like pleasing, and looks new. They upgraded their tv's to flat screen tv's. Aesthetically, I cannot complain; the walkways to the rooms look new too, like they've just repainted the walls and put in new carpeting.\\n\\nThe pool was smaller than what I'm used to, but the design and layout was very accommodating. All the chairs were cushioned, like the ones at the Palms. Their were plenty of tables and chairs underneath shades for people who just want to relax and not tan. This, too, was aesthetically pleasing.\\n\\nThank you Hampton, for making this trip so pleasant and hassle-free! I will be back.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "While in Chicago I made the mistake of asking for a thin crust pizza and I was chased out by two burly Paizzzialos with hair on their back.. When I moved here, from the windy city (this is more windy city than Chicago. Few years ago, the Las Vegas Hilton sign, came folding in half in a 140-mile wind, and a guy from Dubuch Iowa, thought it was part of the Vegas free shows-like the pirate show-and he was so sure of it, he was on News at Ten.) \\n\\nLas Vegas is probably the thin crust pizza capitol of the world since an Austrian named Puck, who has fed the emaciated starlets in Los Angeles, has brought the thin crust into vogue here. My search for a TCP led to Pizza Hut, specially the one on West Sahara.  I made the mistake of ordering the same at a place called Mr. B's on Paradise Rd.(now defunct for good reasons) and the pizza looked like some one had opened a farmers market on a pizza crust.. There was more cheese than all of  Wisconsin and it left a trail all the way to the kitchen.My friend a life long Vegan has turned carnivorous since then. It took a toll on my taste buds and I had to move back to Chicago for taste rehab..\\n\\nI continued my search till I bumped into this place, which I have passed by, but had no idea it was an Italian joint, since the name is more like Mr. Bojangles doing a tap dance or house full of  tap dancers? till you go in and the blaring sports on TV and the smoke it is something to do with beer on tap. It is not an open kitchen but you can see through the service window there are few amigos working feverishly and it the turnover is amazing for a tiny kitchen. What the very friendly  waitresses  bring out is undoubtedly the best Veggie pizza I have ever eaten in Vegas or anywhere.\\n\\nI start drooling by the time I turn corners (I found out there is a name for this-it is called Pavlov reflex). The parking lot is not paved so it is good idea to have a tow truck as your second car or a bring a flag and let everyone know the Eagle has landed..

For instance, Coup des Tartes tweeted that they would be running the Yelp Eats menu this past Friday and Saturday. I was super excited because the night I was supposed to go there was a family emergency and I had to cancel. Anyway, once we arrived we were given the standard menu so we asked about the Yelp Eats menu, \\\"oh yeah sure\\\". What was brought back was not the Yelp Eats menu but some 3 course prix fix menu for $25 that didn't even have one Yelp Eats item on it. No onion tart, no lamb shank etc.. VERY disappointing and irritating. Do not call a Ferrari a Corvette, no matter how you slice it, they aren't the same thing. \\n\\nAnyway.. ended up ordering the pate and onion tart appetizers. The pate is not house made and tasted like liverwurst, the onion tart was very good. However, once we learned that there was no wine service and a (correction, not $12) $9 corkage fee, that was the nail in the coffin, we were out the door. \\n\\nAt the end of the day they falsely tweeted to get customers in the door then try to pass off something that isn't.

        "Review: This is as good as it gets for the Phoenix Valley, Brings authentic feel, with its service, design and especially food. Treat your self to Chinese food they way it should be prepared.  \\n\\nMenu is very large and has authentic dishes so bring a friend with knowledge.\\n\\nBy service I mean you feel like your at a Chinese restaurant the staff is not there to make you feel like fine dinning. I mean they don't speak a lot of English and are fast to serve but fast to vanish.  \\n\\nSat and Sunday treat your self to dim sum. This is \\\"a touch of heart\\\" eating a very traditional Chinese style eating.  Dishes are brought out in small quantities of delight.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "We are fans of Pistella Beer Distributors simply because we needed beer one night while visiting some friends and family in Pittsburgh and they happened to be on the way to something we were doing.  It's a hole in the wall kind of facade but they do have a good selection.  I don't remember the price being that expensive but looking at the average review so far...it shows $$$$.  I'm sure they have some nice stuff, but we just got a case of beer (I think one of those Magic Hat variety packs) and it seemed similar to what we would pay in the other stores.  Anyway, we had a good experience with this place and don't really have anything bad to say about them.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Walking up to the entrance of Bob Taylor's Ranch House, you are either going to think it is a piece of history or a piece of sh*t. The building is so old, I wouldn't doubt if your great great great great great great grandpa grew his first pube in it. All joking aside, Bob Taylor's Ranch House has been in business since 1955 so they must be doing something right. Right? Beano Fatardo investigates.\\n\\nFirst of all, you will get cancer the second you walk into Bob Taylor's. Even with just a few customers, the place reeked of everyone's favorite combination : stale cigarettes and fresh cigarettes. On top of that, the place was dark, dingy, and depressing. I felt like I was in an old bowling alley. The only difference is that old bowling alleys serve somewhat edible food.\\n\\nNot only was my hamburger a once frozen patty, the steak fries had less flavor than water. I would have loved to try the coleslaw instead of the fries, but it wasn't prepared yet! Why do I have a feeling the cook is on a morning-long smoke break..... inside the restaurant!?\\n\\nThe only reason I am not giving Bob Taylor's a single star is because the bacon on my burger was nice and thick. That has to account for something, right? In the end, Bob Taylor's Ranch House isn't even good enough for Pittsburgh Steeler fans. And I hear they eat old pee-soaked newspapers.

        "We were actually brought here by Annie W. during our visit to UIUC. (Not sure if you can tell, she's a big fan!)\\n\\nI ordered half a hummus pita with a garden salad on the side. I actually liked the hummus, although I don't eat hummus as much as I'd like to. There were lots of fresh veggies in there, although the distribution through my little pita pocket was a bit awkward. (Chock full o' hummus on one side, lots of veggies on the other.) I ordered the salad with the sesame tahini, but I wasn't a huge fan of the tahini. I don't eat tahini often, though, so maybe I'm just not a tahini person? (The vinaigrette would've complemented the meal better.) The meal was served with some plain popcorn.\\n\\nI found my meal okay, but I would definitely be cautious to omnivores (and especially carnivores xD). Many of the people I was eating with were pretty dissatisfied with the flavors in their food? Even the little bottle of hot sauce (I think it was a kind of salsa?) wasn't really doing much to quench their hunger. I'm a bit more used to vegetarian food, but if your friends aren't used to vegetarian food, this is probably not the place to try to introduce them to it.\\n\\nI liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, but again, it can come off as \\\"weird\\\" and \\\"hippie-ish\\\" for people who aren't used to it. We had a guy playing BOTH the guitar and the xylophone up front and, not going to lie, he was reinforcing the stereotype of \\\"hippie-ish\\\" in this restaurant with his look a wee bit, according to some of my lunchmates.\\n\\nBut I liked it. There was a little station for you to fill up on water, iced tea, or hot tea, cane sugar, organic teas... considering that you're not paying a whole lot, I thought that you got a pretty great deal, ESPECIALLY if you are a vegetarian or a vegan, you know? \\n\\nHowever, if you're bringing a friend who has never heard of seitan and doesn't really like that organic feel, then this is the wrong place to bring him/her. If you're into that, though, this is an AWESOME place. Even the back of the...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

My last experience was great, to be honest I though my stylist was having a bad day. She was rough with my hair and her body language screamed I don't want to be here but I can be wrong and she was definitely pleasant. The mood seemed to change when the owner walked in which happens to a lot of businesses. In the end though she cut my hair and I love it. Its a new style for me but everyone who has seen it loves it, much better than my long Darth Vader helmet I have been rockin'. \\n\\nPast experiences were not so great. I am not kidding but I had a hair cut that took 5 minutes. She didn't even do anything. She didn't do what I asked and overall I wasn't happy with the style and I have had my hair cut from her two times and both were terrible. She is still their at the salon but I was fortunate she wasn't there. I will definitely go back but I will try to avoid her.

I am an Indian and I love Indian food but their food gave me hard time in digestion; I suffered for 2 days. \\n\\nPrice-wise too, I wound't order again when I can have whole buffet at Tamarind at less than half price. I ordered chicken curry, the one at Coriander Restaurant on Murray Ave is yummy but this one was so-so in taste, mostly disappointing. I also ordered Samosa, I find the poorly fried samosas of Bombay Mart better than these ones. Then I ordered tikki (aloo patty), really disappointed, it looked several weeks old reheated in microwave. I know from 24 years of experience how fresh tikki tastes like. \\n\\nI like Indian restaurants in this order: Uddupi, Tamarind, Coriander, Indian Carts at Pitt, even Yuva India and All India more than this one. But definitely it's better than Prince of India, where food smells like 2 week old and there is absolutely no taste in the food.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: My friends and I ended up eating here just randomly, walking down the street to find something to eat. We were actually heading over to Ihop, but saw that Mandarin Wok had dim sum, so we stopped in.\\n\\nI've never experienced this type of service before - or lack there of. They bring the food out to you and plates, but everything else is up to you. Get your own drinks (chrysanthemum tea, jasmine tea, or water), your own utensils, your own sauce (they had packaged soy sauce and sweet and sour sauce, usually not what I use for dim sum), and you have to get up and order at the cashier.\\n\\nThey should really put a sign up or make sure people know to order, a family walked in while we were half way done with our dim sum, and they just sat there. The girl who was working wasn't doing anything important but she didn't even walk over to them, give them a menu, or anything until the man called for her.\\n\\nAnywho, the dim sum just reaches the bare minimum for passing off as an okay meal. Perhaps in a small town it's good, but it doesn't compare to Chinatown in the Chi.\\n\\nThere wasn't a lot of options, only about 25 items. \\n\\nMy favorite thing for dim sum is shrimp crepes and turnip cake. Both of which were disappointing! The shrimp crepe only had two small pieces of shrimp. The turnip cake was just off, seemed like it wasn't cooked right.  The shui mai and shrimp dumpling were small, but it tasted fine.\\n\\nNot entirely saddened by this experience because at least it wasn't expensive. Around $7 to share 10 dishes. I don't think we left a tip, since we really didn't have a waitress/waitor.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

First off we were treated rudely over the drive thru order radio.  We had to repeat our fairly small order three times and it still wasnt correct when we got to the window.  Second we waited for close to 30 minutes with only one car in front of us.  We finally got our food and went home to eat it.  Upon taking my first bite of my mexican burger i immediately started to gag and threw up a little in my mouth.  All i could taste was extremely burnt onions and insanely soggy bun.  I dont know how somebody could hand this food to somebody to eat and not feel bad.  I wouldnt even give what was left to the dog.  It went strait to the trash and now im ordering a pizza.

        "Had a great stay here over the past couple of days.  We came as an unwind after a far-too-busy wedding week for our stay-honeymoon.  We got a great deal on 3 nights and didn't really need to leave the hotel, a big plus.\\n\\nThe grounds of the hotel are beautiful, lovely ruddish pink with lots of trees and wood furniture abound.  There is a big pool with plenty of room for us but there is no sense of privacy there and it feels just kinda mediocre.\\n\\nThe rooms I am told are all suites, but since we were h-mooning it, the sweet ladies at the desk gave us a room with a beautiful view of the TPC course, the sunset and Camelback/Piestewa.  The room was very comfortable, great couch and huge bed, two flat screens and a balcony which was a perfect location for a room service feast.\\n\\nWe loved the food here, eating one dinner from room service and eating at the restaurant the other.  Both times we had the wedge salad, it was huge, very bleu cheesy and served with blistered tomatoes, which were sweet like fruit.  The restaurant night we shared the pot-roast, which was truly excellent.  The waiter described it as \\\"like mom makes\\\" and we didn't disagree.  The drinks, they have a great selection, but they were pretty over-priced at $12 for an Absolute Mandarin and soda for the lady.\\n\\nThis is more of a business hotel than a honeymoon spot, but we got such a deal that we were able to make a resort of it.  If you're coming in town to golf or watch golf at the TPC, I think this would be the perfect spot. My rating for this place is",

        "One star because I have to give a star. We gave this doctor a year. Dr Adams is amazing. I hate that she won't be my doctor anymore. But her staff is absolutely the worst I have ever dealt with. And this office uses refills as a money machine. You will not get any refills done without an appointment. And they won't call you to tell you that you have to make an appointment for your refill either. \\nThe staff never call you back. Ever. The nurse is so unbelievably rude. Awful. Like rude to where I've almost cried dealing with her. \\nI can't imagine that Dr Adams doesn't know how bad her staff is. So she should be held accountable for her ignorance by losing patients. \\nAnd forget making an appointment. They don't even try to honor their appointment times. And they don't care either! \\nIf this doctor ever cleans house and replaces her staff completely, I'll consider going back. My rating for this place is",

        "Review: I ordered from this store this evening while General Manager Jimmy was on duty and my order was incorrect.  The french fries were not fresh and they neglected to send my 2nd order of macaroni salad.  I called to advise them of their error and was passed off to Jimmy who did not offer to compensate me for my trouble. He would be glad to send me what I paid for but would have to pay for my antipasto salad which i requested in place of my error in ordering the gluten free salad. This is the second time i have had a problem at this store.  This will be the last time i place an order with any Streets of New York.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nThey are unique to Pittsburgh and the crepes are outstanding.  The owner is a nice guy who made a point to say hello to some guests who I was with this morning who frequent much more than I do.  The place was packed at 2 PM on a saturday I can't imagine it being comfortable on a Sunday or Saturday AM.  The wait staff in general is off and I'm really not sure why.  I mean sure they are busy, but in these types of non-franchise \\\"bohemian\\\" joints usually the 20 somethings are exceptionally nice.  Oh, well maybe this is part of the authentic Frecnch experience.  You do feel the need to eat quickly because of  the other customers eyeing you up for the precious few seats available.  Outside of the venue and service the crepes are the best I've ever had in Pittsburgh and if the service and venue was better this  could easily be four or maybe even five stars.  I had the smoked salmon with creme fraiche' and it was perfect.  It had great quality ingredients and was truly delicious.  A friend had the ham and cheese which was also excellent and another had  just a  traditional crepe with maple syrup.  This was also a smashing success.  I think the owner needs to share with his young staff some of the hospitality he showed my friends, but I'm guessing they don't feel this is necessary since they seem to be at capacity already.\n\nStars:",

        "Delicious!! My husband and I were in Las Vegas for a few days and purchased several Groupons to try while in town. Samosa Factory has become one of our favorite Indian places. We had a chicken samosa, chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, and plain naan. \\n\\nThe chicken samosa was packed with flavor and very fresh! The chicken tikka masala was not as sweet as we liked, but still fantastic. The saag paneer was more saucy than other Indian places; regardless, we really liked the dish. \\n\\nThe service was absolutely fantastic and topped off the wonderful night.

        "So, the Eat N Park company decided to renovate the Squirrel Hill shop.  They spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make the place look hip and trendy, with high tables and chairs, garage door windows to allow for opening and closing during the nicer seasons to 'open air' the place. They spent money on new art that shows the neighborhood. The gave the facade a facelift with stone and paint, and cut the place in half to create another bistroid on what used to be the left side of the seating area. \\n\\nEverything is new. New counters and display cases, new carpeting, regular chairs and tables, and upholstered booths. New lighting fixtures. There's even a TV for - well - yet MORE sports coverage in da burgh.\\n\\nOn the wall between the restrooms is a huge banner boasting of how much money they've given to local charities annually. If I recall correctly, the amount was around $2 Million.\\n\\nSo they have money to spend on new restaurants, like Porch, an overstated atmospheric case of overpriced mediocrity, and whatever this new bistroid is that's next to the old but new Eat N Park. They have money to renovate the Eat N Park into an apparent trendy high end diner. They have enough money to donate $2 Million to charity.\\n\\nBut dear Eat N Park...what about the FOOD?\\n\\nGenerally, the only reason my friend and I go to Eat N Park is to grab the breakfast buffet before an afternoon of movies.  Which we did this morning, and what did we find?\\n\\nA big fancy renovation - with the same ol' crappy food.\\n\\nScrambled eggs out of a carton that would make a World War II military man feel right at home. Rubbery pancakes. The same out-of-a-can cheese sauce for whatever you wanted to ladle it over. The same flavorless sausage gravy for dried out biscuits. Sausage greasy enough to lube your 1957 Buick. And they can't even be bothered with the little potato pancakes that used to actually be kind of yummy. One the first trip to the buffet, they had maybe six potato-pancake-like chunks left in the pan, and when we came back for...\nSo I would like to give it",

One of those times, I sat at the bar with my boyfriend, and the sushi chef chatted with us. He was really chill & polite, so I'm surprised by Bret's comment -- perhaps it was a different chef?\\n\\nThe food is good, and I like their menu a lot. They have a variety of ingredients in their rolls beyond the standard California roll-type options. One of my favorites is the salmon & mango roll. It always tastes really fresh and tangy delicious.\\n\\nEvery time I've been there, I've been offered dessert on the house. I usually turn it down, as I'm too full of sushi, but one time I accepted and was presented with a cute little dish of green tea ice cream. It was better than green tea ice cream that I've had elsewhere. They have mochi too, I believe (yay!).\\n\\nI also really appreciate the fact that they don't blare hip hop music (as is typical of some sushi bars, especially in the Tempe area).\\n\\nOverall, I have no complaints! This sushi restaurant is totally worth giving a try.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I had made reservations weeks in advance, they knew our size and what time we were arriving. We get there about 5 minutes late and our table isn't even ready. So a group of us stand around for a good 10 minutes waiting. We finally get seated...it took 30 minutes just to get WATER on our table and then another 15-20 minutes to get our drink order. Its seriously like this every time I have gone here no matter the size of the group. \\n\\nWe order apps and our food. The apps came out with in about 30 minutes and were tasty! Our meals arrived about 30 minutes after appetizers. There were 11 of us, so it wasn't a totally enormous party. \\n\\nMy $15 salad was ok....but not worth the money. One person ordered soup which never arrived. Two people ordered soup with their dinner that came out with our drinks, and then they brought them another bowl of soup with their meals and then tried to argue with them when they said they had already had the soup. Whatever. \\n\\nOur waiter was good. He didn't come around as frequently as he could of, we had lots of empty water glasses for long periods of time. But he was pretty on the ball and we had fun talking to him. \\n\\nThe piano player is what really makes this place something special, with out her it would be an over priced boring cafe trying to be something it is not.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

She started looking at Italian restaurants that were semi-close to where we live and Buon Gusto popped up.  The reviews were great so we headed on over.   I have driven past this restaurant a number of times and have never seen it.  This place is pretty nice.  It's very small, warm, and welcoming.  The Calamari was very lightly breaded and had the right amount of salt for seasoning.  My wife loved it and even though I'm not the biggest fan, I thought it was pretty great as well.  My wife ordered the Manicotti and it was some of the best I've ever had.  I had the Sicilian Style Eggplant which is baked and topped with Mozzerella cheese.  It was very good and there was a lot of it.  The waitress was great and the timing of the appetizer, salads, and entrees was perfect.

        "Crisp evening air ruffled my jacket as I approached the fine Outback Steakhouse. Having been held hostage by family over the month long college break, any fresh air outside of the family compound is greatly appreciated. \\n\\nUpon walking in it becomes incredibly obvious that there is a lot of activity going on this New Years Day, and in spite of that am seated fairly quickly with my family of five. The waiter, a fine gentleman with excellent bedside manners, quickly gets our drinks ready and an appetizer ordered. \\n\\nFor an appetizer, my father insists on these bizarre fried onion fingers with a sauce dip. Blind sighted by the sheer rawness of some of those onions, I shed a single tear similar to Denzel Washington's performance in the film Glory. \\n\\nAfter accepting defeat to the raw power of the onions, my food gets in after a moderate waiting period of 15 minutes. I had ordered a medium done Double Burger. Due to my forced celibacy that is winter break, I was really looking forward to biting into a nice delicious burger as I quietly get off to the juicy tomato squirting in my mouth, but upon cracking open the buns I saw I had a single paper thin tomato slice. Obviously turned off, I figure what the hell, I'll get off later. But as I keep munching on the burger I notice the patties were not really consistently cooked... One was well done and the other was sort of medium, sort of raw in some parts. \\n\\nAt this point, I give up, eat the fries and call it a day. I clearly ordered the wrong things and should have just eaten a steak at a steakhouse. At least the fries were really good. \\n\\nI also noticed the place is an awkward hot spot for seniors. May just be the holiday but I wouldn't recommend going out for a drink here from what I saw.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

There was much confusion in the office mostly apparently because of a Vinnie that wasn't even there.  Apparently Vinnie takes reservations but with not enough information (such as \\\"this customer needs a minivan\\\").  A few other people in there were also having isssues.  Had it not been for this Saturday guy (wish I knew his name), no one would have had a vehicle.  He did the best he could with what he had and managed to make everyone there very happy.

        "Review text:\nAfter getting an advert in the mail touting an extensive gluten free menu, I was pretty pumped to try this place out the next time I got a craving for pizza (which is never!). I called the location that has the GF menu and was told that they don't deliver to my area and that i'd have to call the North Side location. I'm not driving anywhere when I want pizza (it's a lazy night in/delivery kind of thing for me), so no gluten free for me. Sorry, stomach. \\nBoth locations I called had terrible phone service. I was given a turnaround time of an hour, and much to my surprise, it arrived after 30 minutes. I ended up pretty dissatisfied though. \\nI ordered a buffalo wing pizza which tasted like greasy bread. They just threw slices of breaded chicken on top and a few sprinkles of buffalo sauce under the cheese. They also failed to include the ranch dressing(s!) that the pizza was supposed to come with. Getting a whiff of ranch dressing was what made me crave pizza in the first place, ha. I ordered spicy citrus wings as well and they just tasted like... kind of spicy fried food. I'm bummed that the one time a year I eat pizza was such a letdown. I had high hopes for you Mandy's!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

Always consistent, always spectacular service & always delicious food; my family eats here at least once a week.  \\nMy son devours the Sesame Chicken lunch.  The portion size is a little large for a 5 year old, but that's good because he can make two or three meals out of it.  He prefers their Lo Mein to the fried rice, but that is just his choice.  My parents love the Cashew Chicken and Sacha (?) Chicken.  They always get a double order of fried rice because they love the rice.  I usually change up my order based on what I'm craving.  The tofu & veggies is awesome, as is the beef & onions.  I LOVE their crab rangoons & wonton soup.  In fact, I'm going to order that today!  Oh!

        "Review: We heard today from my son who wife and he dined at the resturant Sat. evening about 7:30 pm. Work all day and get a chance to go out to sit down once or so a month and come away with less than expected dining.experience. We watched the kids to give them a chance to relax. \\nI asked if the resturant was busy and he says it didn't appear to be. The problem is the Fajitas which come, as he says on a platter with the fixings and a separte hot plate with the meat on one end. The meat wasn't hot and sizzling like it is suppose to be but luke warm. He should have sent it back but they were too hungry at that hour and just wanted to eat. I find fault with the server as this stuff should be put up to serve hot and if left on the bank to be picked up too long it isn't the kitchens fault. Like I said, he said it wasn't busy so the server must have been busy doing social things. maybe posting or catching up. But no reason to serve a dish on a cast iron plate if it isn't searing hot. \\nDon't get me wrong here as I have good reports from my wife who she and friends love  Zs.. i have never been there and i like my food served HOT. Zs just lucky it was my son and not me as you got a pass this time and a pass ain't that greeat. .\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I ordered shrimp fettuccine Alfredo with fig and marscopone purchtuo burchettas. When I got home it was terrible.  The pasta is home made so it's super thick.  Four small shrimp and hardly no Alfredo sauce, I mean dry. That fake bruccetta is hard and dry.  So I called a spoke to Cindy and explained that I lived far from the location.  It practically took me an hour to get there and I couldn't come back.  So she put the owner in the phone and we worked out a deal that I would get a $27.00 credit the next time I came in. \\n\\nFast forward to today which was a couple of weeks later. When I arrived Cindy wasn't there but the owner Richard was.  So I explained who I was and he remembered. So he said I can give you a $17.00 credit because you ate the meal didn't you?  I didn't even touch that dry mess. So being pressured and embarrassed of what the phone conversation was and what he was saying to my face and the place was packed and I didn't want to argue.  I just ordered their signature dish, the Osso buco to- go again. So the waiter rang me up and I ended up paying them about $15.00 additional dollars.  I was pissed off. But I figured well maybe it will be worth it.\\n\\nI get home and make nice salads for me and my husband to accompany the meal still with high hopes because it looks good and the meat is falling off the bone. So we eat it with disappointment.  The sauce is tasteless I mean no flavor at all the bread was dry.\\n\\nI will never return. I will go to Olive garden which I far better than this place. Or just wait to go back to New York and eat authentic Italian at Carmine's or Rao's in Vegas. Or for great bruccettas go to Postionos.\\n\\nI don't know why this place is crowded.  The food is bland and it's so tiny.  I have been to several DDD destinations this one is a BIG miss.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Ate here for lunch last weekend for the first time in over 8 years. I was happy to see that not much had changed, and the sushi was as delicious as ever! I was, however, disappointed in the available sushi lunch specials--I was so spoiled in NYC with all of the cheap sushi lunch spots everywhere! \\n\\nThe lunch menu here is seriously lacking in sushi, so I opted for a bento box which was huge (and cost about $13). I liked just about everything involved, and you get choices for each section of the box. You do get sushi with the bento box, but the selection is limited-either one roll (I got the spicy tuna, which actually had a lot more to it than just tuna-yum!) or two pieces of nigiri. \\n\\nI also got teriyaki chicken, which was good but did not come with any rice...that was a bit unexpected, but because there's so much food in the bento box I didn't miss it. My friend ordered a side of it to go with hers and I don't think they charged us for it. For the \\\"salad\\\" option you can choose from sumunomo (probably butchered the spelling on that), turkey salad (sounds random but is actually really good), or seaweed salad (which I ordered). Seaweed was fresh and tasty, and the portion was definitely decent.\\n\\nYou can choose between shumai (shrimp dumplings), gyoza (pork dumplings) or something else that sounded calorie-bombish (I wanna say it was fried cheese? I didn't order it either way). My friend and I were steering clear of fried food so we got the shumai, which ended up being quite fried indeed! I haven't ever seen fried shumai, but I tried a small bite and it was decent but greasy. \\n\\nI was glad that the small amount of sushi I had with lunch was as tasty and fresh as ever-I will definitely be back for more!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Well we drove across town to try this place because of the good reviews. First of all I LOVE hole in the wall Mexican places and I have been to a lot. I am from Denver and pretty much grew up on Colorado Mexican. We spent six years in Southern Cali, and about two years in Arizona. The food is just very,different then Colorado and with that said I want to rate this place on the low end of the scale. If the chips and salsa would have been decent I probably would have left a bit happier. The chips were cold, thick and flavorless, the salsa was a very thin not so great as well. There were 5 adults in our party, everyone got something different. I was not impressed by any of it. I ordered a chimichanga at the recommendation of the server and it was not good at all.  I got it \\\"enchalada\\\" style for two more dollars and it had about a spoonful under it, not enchalada style at all and for $12.00 I was like seriously wishing we were anywhere else then there. The waitress was very friendly and brought me a side of sauce but the best thing about this place is you get a giant Coke with refills. My husband and daughter had a margarita and they were decent but for just under a hundred bucks I was pissed all the way home lol!,\\nIf your ever in Colorado hit the Santiago's, and see how we make our Mexican :)\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nA few years after an unpleasant visit to Enzo's , when a nasty attitude caused us to walk out before ordering, I decided to give it a second try.\\n\\n If I were writing this review a few years back,  I would've given Enzo's one star and make them the leading listing on a \\\"Failed Remedial Business Skills 101\\\" list. The deal was that my brother and myself walked inside around 3 p.m. At any rate, instead of being greeted warmly, the older woman snapped something about we cannot get the lunch special. This was approximately two minutes past the end of the lunch special.  And why did she assume we wanted the lunch special?  Immediately afterwards we left and took our business elsewhere. This experience left us with a terrible impression of Enzo's.\\n\\n   A couple of apartment leases later, I returned to Enzo's for the lunch special.  I peaked inside to see if the older woman was there. It seemed safe. The restaurant was relatively empty. Maybe other people had had similar experiences here. The younger woman at the counter was pleasant. I got past the walking out before I order stage,  and paid $6 plus change for the lunch special. \\n\\n  The lunch special includes two slices of New York pizza and medium soda. Soda refills are 50 cents. The pizza could hold its own to a decent New York pizzaria. Enzo's Pizza literally gives a slice of New York's food culture to Henderson Nevada. Still I have tasted better pizza in the Las Vegas valley. \\n\\n  I am giving Enzo's three stars. A future review could keep it the same rating or change it. If I come in around 3:02 p.m., and am given an attitude,  there will be a new list on Yelp. Enzo's had been an example of a restaurant serving good food that turns away business with lousy customer service.\n\nReview rating:",

        "I am late in writing this review, as it was about a year ago that I got my hair cut at Cinema.  My stylist was Shiloh, and though she seemed friendly and nodded along with the requests that I made, I ended up very unhappy with the cut.  It was noticeably lopsided (I must have missed it at the salon, maybe because of how she'd styled it, but my roommate could see it as soon as I got home), and the layers were incredibly choppy and not well-blended (the one thing that I stressed as my pet peeve.)  To the salon's credit, I did not let them know that I was unhappy and did not give them a chance to fix it, which I probably should have. \\n\\nA few weeks later, I went to another salon not too far away and had a FAR superior experience.  While combing through my hair they concurred that the cut was sloppy, and gave me what I had been looking for in the first place.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

When my mom and I were seriously considering a dress, she latched on to our vulnerability and said, \\\"You must hold this dress.  You won't find a better one.\\\"  I said OK, not knowing better, and gave her $50 to hold the dress until we could be sure.  I was under the impression the $50 would be refunded if I changed my mind, or applied toward final purchase of whatever dress I chose.  After looking elsewhere and finding the dress I knew I wanted, I called Vera's to cancel my next appointment.  I asked if the $50 could be reimbursed on my credit card, and the woman said, abruptly, \\\"NO.\\\"  They conned my mom and me out of $50 to \\\"hold\\\" a dress.

        "Review: **THE MOST GROSS DISGUSTING HOTEL IN AZ, CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS**** DO NOT STAY HERE!\\n\\nI flew some work employees down to AZ for a training that lasted a week.  Not being from AZ I went on Hotels.com and saw some fairly pleasant reviews about this hotel.  I showed it to my reps and they loved the fact that it had a small kitchen that they could cook their own food!  Great!!  I booked the hotel\\n\\nI get a call from one of my reps on Monday who is also at the brink of tears. She said that a huge baseball team was there with the families.  Kids screaming, ruining up and down the hallways.  Rooms were filthy, sheets were disgusting, towels not clean.  Also this baseball team was indoors smoking pot...which lingered through the entire hotel.  One of  my girls stuffed dirty towels under the door to block the smoke coming into her room.   Finally they had had enough, so they go to to the front desk and wait to stand in line behind the WHOLE OTHER GROUP OF GUESTS WHO WENT DOWN TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SMOKE AND ALL THE NOISE THIS BASEBALL TEAM WAS MAKING.\\n\\nThe college kids who work the front desk really didn't give a rip and said \\\"sorry, nothing we can do\\\"   I got a hold of the district managers cell phone and call and left a msg...did she call me back ..HELL NO....LOL..wasn't surprised that I didn't get one.\\n\\nNeedless to say I immediately moved them to the Comfort Inn in Chandler and they LOVED IT!! Clean, quiet...customer service was incredible!\\n\\nI have any more trainings to send my reps to and this hotel most certainly will not get my money...........\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

For lunch, this place definitely hits the spot and tastes good. I have 2 criticisms though. One, I do not understand paying the exact same for a sandwich because their options vary in meat selection and non-meat selections. A turkey and provolone should not cost the same as a meat stuffed with 4-5 different meats. Just sayin. And two, which is my biggest criticism, is they are ONLY OPEN UNTIL 5PM?!?!?! What kind of crap is that?!?! How much business is this place losing by closing so early? I came here for dinner once and was shooed away at the door at 4:59PM. Wow.\\n\\nAll in all, this place is good and would recommend. Their meat and cheeses are sliced fresh every order and I do like the fact there are 2 separate counters for ordering. Prices are also reasonable, way better than Jersey Mike's. Location here isn't awesome, it's a little hidden off Broadway and 48th street. It's next to Papa John's so when you see that, turn into the complex with Staples.  It's minutes from work so I am somewhat of a regular here.

I really liked my experience there working for Avon Walk twice, competing at World Affairs Council World Quest twice, and hanging out with friends. So I almost gave it four stars. But I have to be professional. I do see a lot of things that i would change if I were running it.\\n\\nThat doesn't mean that it isn't good. It still is a nice hotel. Some people just love Westin for what it is. Not too fancy but one of the big boys. But the way the guests were lined up and waiting in the small lobby in multiple direction was difficult to overlook. There were some even blocking the entrance.\\n\\nThe nice things about it is that it's in the right place. Location, location, location. It's in the center city, yet not right beside the biggest businesses and heavy traffic. The overstreet mall isn't connected to the hotel, if I remember correctly, but everything is in walking distance. And if you are in the city for conventions, or a professional sports game, it's a perfect place to stay.\\n\\nI have also been to most other popular hotels in Charlotte. The city doesn't have a Four Seasons, Wardorf Astoria type of a hotel. So for what it offers, it's pretty good. So enjoy it.\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nSo unhappy with my experience at this store. LOVE my new GS5 and my coverage has been perfect, but I would recommend avoiding this store.  The day we went to shop we spent at least 45 minutes waiting- not a big deal. They were busy, I get it.  When we finally saw a rep he was very sales-y and kind of pushy. I just told you I'm here for a new plan and phone.... you don't have to sell me. \\n\\nAnyway, he tells us about a current regional promotion where we would receive a free 1gb of data for the entire contract length as long as we ported in a local number. Perfect, I wanted to anyway.  After another hour of him fumbling to get the phones set up and numbers ported in we were finally on our way.  \\n\\nThe next day we notice on our phones that our plan says we only have 1gb of data. We call Verizon and they explain that the promotion doesn't start until the second month. Again, not that big of a deal, but pretty annoying that he didn't find that necessary to tell us.\\n\\nWell, a couple of days ago our second month starts and what do you know, we still only have 1gb!  After speaking with Verizon on the phone they told us the promotion actually started 5 days after we started our plan and the employee just told us about it early. They assured us it shouldn't be a problem, just to go to the store and have it sorted it.\\n\\nOnce at the store my boyfriend received terrible customer service.  He spoke with the manager and she was completely inflexible and unapologetic. I'm sorry, but if your employee is giving the wrong information you need to do the right thing and honor it. \\n\\nIf we had known it wasn't starting yet we could have simply waited a couple of days to start our contract.  Now we are stuck in contract for two years with different terms than we thought we were agreeing to with a company that doesn't honor their promises.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I was however pleasantly surprised with the free wi-fi in my room. I was able to work in the morning while my husband and son slept. Great bonus. This justifies the third star. The bed is a lot more comfortable than I expected and the room was clean and cozy. I would stay here again just so we can save money and spend it elsewhere!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Ordering:\\nThe menu exclaimed that the chicken salad sandwich rocked, so I being easily persuaded ordered the chicken salad sandwich.    Each of their sandwiches comes with a side and a bag of potato chips.  I chose the potato salad.  I was given a number and I sat down.  The place was quite busy with only one center table available.  The food was brought out rather quickly.\\n\\nThe food:\\nThe sign lied to me.  It did not rock.  It was more like listening to Enya.  Shredded lettuce, tomato, ordinary chicken salad on regular store bought bread.  The potato salad was also rather bland.\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\nThere were a lot of people and some nice music to go along with the chatter.  It had an exposed ceiling with large windows that faced McDowell.  The place gave off a nice downtown hipster vibe.  I gave the place an extra star because of the atmosphere.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nNot quite as good as Paradise Bakery but, better pricing and atmosphere.  I will come back but, I will order something else. My rating for this place is",

        "Let my start by saying I go here all the time. This fact notwithstanding, I have to admit that its definitely not my favorite Chinese food restaurant in the area. They advertise themselves as New York Style Chinese food, which, since I'm not from New York, doesnt mean a whole lot to me. Though from what I've tasted, I'm assuming that means not as authentic and a little Americanized. The one thing that constantly frustrates me about Red Dragon is that I order something having a guess about how its going to be and it ends up being nothing like it. Once I ordered the crispy chicken thinking it would be the deep fried chicken with crispy skin that you can get in most Chinese restaurants, and it ended up being this shaved, deep fried chicken in a sweet sauce. Utterly disappointing, though it wasnt necessarily a bad dish. The fried rice here is hit or miss- a hit being a passable version, while a miss ends up being partially cooked rice \\\"crispies\\\". Their egg foo yung is pretty good, and their -enter choice of meat- with broccoli/veggies is well done, if not a little too oily. The one thing I like about this place especially is their soups, which are very inexpensive- $3 for a quart- though they are premade and the amount of ingredients reflects the price. But I actually like simplicity so it suits me just fine.  Unfortunately, for most of the things on the menu, and I've tried quite a few, there is sweet undertone accompanying them. Also, a quick note...this place has only 3 small tables, so unless you are a very small party or eating a quick meal, I would opt for the take-out.\\n\\nThe one great advantage they have over other places is, as others have mentioned, the price, and also that they are open till 10 on most nights. If another restaurant is open, I'll usually skip Red Dragon, but if I have to choose between so-so Chinese food and Taco Bell just up the street, its really no decision at all.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nTLDR Version: Delicious Cake, Craig is a bit Confusing, Cake decorations were wrong after two confirmations, but still pretty.  \\n\\nWe booked Craig's Cakes for our August wedding.  They were easy to book and surprisingly available for how good their cakes are.  \\n\\nTastings should be booked by phone, as per usual.  The amount of cake they provide for the tasting is a little intimidating, such big portions!  I kind of want to do it once a month, the cake is SO good.  After I had a chance to taste the food, the owner and official Craig came to talk over the details.  This is where things get Really confusing.  He talks very fast and makes indecipherable notes that I had to call back to clarify after.  Also, I could do without his personal injury stories and opinions on labor laws, I'm just here for the cake!  \\n\\nThey have a ton of options, including half-fake cakes if you want the three tiered look without the cost.  They do not do fondant work, but instead do beautifully smooth buttercream or a whipped cream with white chocolate shavings that is Excellent.  A wide variety of cake flavors, though I wish they would start doing a red velvet, for that you'll have to go to Rolling Pin Bakery on Fish Hatchery.  \\n\\nThe one downside was that after confirming the decorations and cake fillings the week before and then the day before, our cake ended up wrong.  All of the fillings and flavors we asked for were there, but some were in the wrong order, I'm not sure why that bothers me (probably because I am a huge freak), but it does.  The biggest problem is that we asked for an icing Monogram on our second tier and a specific swirl type.  When we arrived, there was no monogram and the wrong swirl.  It was still really delicious and beautiful, but not what we had talked about.  Sad times.  \\n\\nThe costs may seem high compared to places like the afforementined Rolling Pin, but that is because there is twice the cake and icing per slice, so each slice should be cut thinner and you'll have more room for decorations.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

They have a fantastic selection of cheese and it's a great place to try boutique cheeses.  \\n\\nThe current rating is due to the service we received last night.  The hostess was very friendly but our waitress was sorely lacking.  After our food arrived and two in our party still needed silverware, we informed her and she never returned with silverware.  We ended up stealing it from a neighboring table.  She made a bleak attempt at humor telling us that one of the cheeses was a water-based calorie-free cheese when we're pretty sure it's a triple cream.  If she'd had an iota of personality, the joke might have flown.  But, it fell flat and left us confused wondering if we'd really just ordered calorie free cheese.  \\n\\nWe enjoyed our evening anyway.

        "I stopped in here needing to kill some time before meeting my family for dinner at Sapporo (across the parking lot). I always saw ads for this place in the Scottsdale Airpark magazine but never knew where it was. Lucky for me, I finally found it! There is dedicated parking in the front of the coffee shop so I parked there. When I walked in, I was fairly stunned as it twice the size of most Starbucks I have been in. I was immediately welcomed by the employees behind the counter. As I made my way to the counter, I kept trying to figure out where I was going to sit. Since there were a number of good spots, I decided to figure it out after I got my coffee. The menu is expansive and includes the usual coffee drinks, pastries, sandwiches, quiche, etc. I settled for a small, vanilla iced coffee and a double chocolate chocolate chip cookie for just over $4. \\n\\nAfter I got my coffee, I wandered around looking for a spot. I ended up in a back corner that housed a comfy tweed couch with knee height tables and ottoman stools. Across from it were long booths with tables and outlets under all of them. In my corner, there was a bookshelf with used books and checkers. As I was studying, I remember thinking how relaxed I was back there and how the music they played was good and varied. Not the typical Sinatra or hip coffeehouse music they play at Starbucks that annoys the living piss out of me. \\n\\nAlthough this place was so large, there was very much a comfortable feel about the place and the random corners of comfortable seating (couches, armchairs, etc) helped with that. There is also outdoor seating too. I really enjoyed my experience there and loved my cookie so much, I bought another one on the way out. For the next day, of course, duh!\nSo I would like to give it",

They let me view where the dogs were and they even let me go outside to play with the dogs.  They also have very helpful information papers on the dog cages so you have a good basic understanding of the dogs.  After you decide on if you like the dog or not, you fill out an application and they go over it with you.  I cannot believe how awesome this place is.

The hulking Hooters Casino. Walking down the strip, minding my own business, trucks with huge Hooters billboards beckon at every stop, not to mention 3/5 taxis have some form of Hooters advertising on them.  So after 4 days of constant bombardment, before heading off to the airport on day last, I decided to give Hooters a try.  It was dining misadventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was seated at the bar near a group of 4 guys that came in 1 minute before me.  30 minutes later, they had almost finished their wings and I still didn't have my food.  The bargirl who took my order re-assured me a couple of time that my wings+fries would be out soon. Rrrrright.  Honestly she was more interested in checking her cell for text messages and slacking off than getting me my food.  Shortly thereafter, I just walked out, hungry & disgruntled.

        "Okay, okay, I finally get it. I've been told about this place for years and finally stopped in on Friday night around 8 PM.  I guess I'm not the only person who likes pizza on a Friday night because it was packed.  However, we were escorted out back to a beautiful wine bar with great dark lighting, comfy furniture and additional seating.  THe bar itself was pretty small, maybe 8 seats and the place was packed.  It didn't affect our service which was quite good and no one in the group waited for a drink.  The crowd was (I hate this word) \\\"trendy\\\" and most were laughing and having fun.  THe wine seemed to be relatively reasonable priced, however I'd like more options than just italian wine.  We sampled a charcutterie platter which was amazing.  The meats were top notch and flavorful.  The hummus and olives were some of the best I've had and the buffalo mozzarrella was to die for. The best I've ever had.  After a few drinks we were able to secure a table for 6 in the front and the server was prompt and friendly.  Wow, the pizza truly the best I've had in the burgh'.  I love mineos, aiellos, and fioris as much as the next but this is in a different league.  We ordered the neoplolitan pizza which is very simple, light, thin crust and amazing flavor.  As another yelper mentioned this is one of only 16 pizza places in the states to be certified to serve authentic neopolitan pizza.  We also tried some of the other pasta dishes, which were very good but again go for the pizza.  It's one of the best pies I've had coast to coast and I'd stack up against Ray's or any other historic pizza joint in NYC.  I'd give it 5 stars if it had better parking and a better wine selection. My rating for this place is",

        "Review text:\nDuring my college years, or at least those years I was 21+, I made several late night/early morning trips to Pho Kim Long.  Sometimes it was to feed post-clubbing munchies and at other times it was to nurse a post clubbing hangover.  Pho Kim Long was always one of the first Pho restaurants that popped up on Yelp when you searched it and in my less than 100% state I remember thinking it as pretty good.  But now that I'm a little bit older, wiser, and more sober when I eating here, it is more like 2.5 stars (I rounded up for the good blurry memories).\\n\\nA bowl of Pho is right around 7.50 which isn't cheap or crazy expensive.  You can pretty much order any combination of rare beef, tripe, tendon, meatball, etc. that suites your fancy.  They give you a very average portion of everything.  One of the things that stops me from giving them more stars is their broth.  I feel that it is all about the broth; it is what makes or breaks a bowl of Pho.  I just don't find their broth to have very much flavor like other places.\\n\\nAnother reason why I can't justify giving them more stars is because their service is on the slow side.  I've been there on more than one occasion and even though they have lots of room and should have figured out a way to handle to their customer flow, I still always find myself waiting for really long periods of time for my food.  I don't really order anything fancier than a bowl of Pho so it shouldn't take that long.\\n\\nI'm sorry Pho Kim Long. I want to like you more because of our history, but you are just another average Pho Joint and nothing special in my mind.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I eaten at the restaurant twice, same single waitress in the place, and both times the food was def not worth the price. the restaurant was empty both times we ate there and the service was still bad, go figure? The bread she brought was old and stale and they toasted it lightly to mask the staleness. The food took too long to come out and she never came to check on us after taking the order. They try to be \\\"Ala cart\\\" fine dining so the menu is VERY small and very pricey. The average meal is $20 and up and doesn't come with a salad or anything....over all not worth it.

As a family of five with a stroller and a baby, it was definitely a tight squeeze maneuvering around.  Luckily, the staff was pretty friendly and could tell we had no idea where we were going or what we were doing.  We had the weekend specials: Steak Hash and Chilaquiles which were delicious!  I originally ordered the Quiche, but they came and flagged me down after I paid to tell me that they actually ran out.  The woman I spoke with was very sweet and made some recommendations, and gladly switched my order for something more expensive without having me pay the difference.

        "Review text:\nUpstream, you confuse me. \\n\\nMy boss took me to Upstream when I flew into Charlotte for the job I'm at right now, so I have a soft spot for this restaurant.  At the time, and several times after that, Upstream was on my top 5 list.  Now, I'm not so sure I want to pay the money for their inconsistencies. \\n\\nHere are my notes. \\n\\n1. Bento Box is the way to go because the preparations are always different and feature a nice variety of creative, well executed dishes.  It comes in a wooden 4 square box.  Items like a jasmine rice with shitake mushrooms, lemongrass scented jasmine rice, or seared tuna with sesame seeds and an Asian slaw. Cucumber salad.  The only warning: when the bento is on the menu at night for dinner, there is no price.  ASK THE PRICE FIRST! Don't quote me, but I'm pretty sure my bento one night was pushing $30 if not $40. \\n\\n2. The salads are nicely composed.  During the fall, there's a yummy bibb and pear salad with dried cherries I adored, and this summer there is this mixed greens with toasted pistachios and blueberries and poppy seed dressing. I HIGHLY recommend getting either salad with the fried oysters.  But here is where consistency starts to slip. I've had salad here probably 5 or 6 times.  Half of those times, the fried oysters have been under fried, and the batter is a bit pale and the oysters feel limp and taste a bit batter-like.  Once the salad was DRENCHED with dressing, so I ask for it on the side. \\n\\n3. The mussels are OK. They're not particularly plump.  (They're like the one's at George's Brasserie, not very memorable.) \\n\\n4. Sushi.  I think sushi is best had at a Japanese restaurant, or where sushi is the star. That's all.  Not standout, and a bit too rice-y. \\n\\n5. The dessert is downright terrible. I know dessert/pastry is a whole other animal, but honestly, if you have a nice a restaurant as Upstream, get a pastry chef to match. (*Totally agree with reviewer Stephanie in that they may not even HAVE a pastry chef.) \\n\\nMy friends and I had the trio of...\n\nStars:",

She wasn't eating, drinking a little, vomiting, lethargic and some diarrhea. By Monday I thought it was time to get her in for an examination.\\n\\nThe doctor examined her and said it was possible she ate something like a rock or a piece of metal that could be lodged in her digestive track. I was fairly convinced this wasn't the case, that she just wasn't feeling well. The vet developed a treatment plan with estimated costs. I nearly had a heart attack at the $700 estimate. I asked the vet tech if we could just try some medication and she was insistent that it was necessary to at least do the x-ray to ensure there wasn't anything trapped in her system. At this point, I was pretty scared and decided to proceed. \\n\\nMuch to my relief, her insides were all good, which I kind of figured. The Vet gave me medicine and fluids for the dog. The total cost was $300.\\n\\nIn retrospect, I can't help feeling/thinking that they played on my fears and kind of took advantage of me. Certainly trying medicine first is a general good way to go. I mean, my doctor prescribes medicine to see if a condition improves and if not, we go a different road. Not sure why the vet couldn't have done that here.\\n\\nI know my dog and know what she will swallow and what she won't. They on the other hand do not and should probably consider that the owners are not complete idiots, we do know our animals. In the future, I will advocate for the treatment I feel is the best way for my dogs.\\n\\nAt this juncture, I'm really hesitant to return.\n\nStars:",

While they may not offer alot of selection when it comes to rolls, what they do serve up is mighty tasty and sure to satiate even the most hungry of sushi lovers. \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nForget that it's in a strip mall or lacks decor. Just go. Sakana is one of the best places in the Valley to enjoy sushi. They have unique rolls that'll pique your interest, and perhaps encourage an eye brow raise. If colorful rolls aren't your thing, then go with the sashima - the pieces are so generous, you'll feel like you robbed the place.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nThis is a Charlotte Staple. Their menu is timeless as is their history in the South park area.  Yes but try telling that to the hostess who greets you by chewing gum and texting on her phone.   Yeah, I get it, sometimes you just got to get your tweet on, I agree, OMG LOL, I can't believe this guy who just came in here to get his to go order, #LMFAO.   Now don't be discouraged to dine in and sit in the bar area, where if you truly want to feel disconnected from your date, then the touch screen monitors are perfect, for you or the hostess.  After all who sits and talks with each other at dinner any more? The food is on par with an Americana type mid level restaurant, however the service leaves a bit to be desired.  When my salad came with a dried up crusted chicken breast on it and no dressing, I called to speak to a manager, but they were busy. Apparently a Tuesday night is busy for the manager (not the hostess).  The veggie burger tastes like cardboard, although the bun gives it a sort of layered cardboard effect which is not bad, if you're washing it down with tequila.  The filet even if ordered med. rare, comes out med. edible, and asking the wait staff for a refill is like asking the DMV for an estimated wait time; you're probably not going to get what you're looking for.   This is particularly sad because I used to love this restaurant, but even with prepubescent couples or online match dates who sit in the bar area to have the touch screen monitors mediate their awkward conversations,  it's still probably not the right fit.   The ribs are good, but the sides aren't.  If I was going to take anybody here, it would have to be my next door neighbor who lets their dog crap all over my lawn and never picks it up, or my grandfather who doesn't have any taste buds left and isn't bothered by slow service, because it takes him two hours to finish a bowl of soup anyway.  I would call ahead to make sure they're not busy, and definitely not on a Tuesday.\n\nStars:",

        "Review: Chase's Diner has been a staple in my family for a long time now.  It's important to understand that every business has their up and down days.  If you visit an establishment enough, you can begin to tell if they're consistent or not.  The majority of experiences I've had at Chase's have been really great.  I've tried just about everything on the menu.  Favorites include the chicken parmigiana sandwich, smothered breakfast burrito, turkey club sandwich with fresh thick slices of turkey, french dip sandwich, and even the fried shrimp platter is pretty darn good.  Their milkshakes are old school thick, creamy, milk and ice cream shakes with whipped cream and a cherry on top!  Most of the staff offer 'service with a smile', but don't expect the kind of wacky 50's entertainment from the servers like you'd find at Ed Debevick's...this just isn't that kind of place.  However, you will find some pretty cool memorabilia on the walls and great tunes on the jukebox.  Chase's Diner will always remain a favorite of my family.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Hehe!  \\nSeriously though, the drive through seems like a good option but I haven't tried it because I fear the decision making process will then come to a screeching halt because I would be lacking the ability to actually SEE what they have.\\nFTMP, all of the donuts they sell here are a glazed donut, some with a different twist (literally) and some with the addition of spice, fruit, or flavored gel.  They are good, but I gotta tell ya, my first job was in a bakery so I have a liking for more than a simple glazed donut.  Oh alright, I'm picky.  Listen, if I'm paying I can be picky.  \\nI'll give this the thumbs up for location and the drive through has to be a bonus for some.  For me, I'll stay with my personal fave and go to Bashas.

        "I came here based on reviews comparing it to Eliiana's, considering I had never even seen it (it's pretty well hidden). And my philosophy is, any place with papusa deserves a shot. \\n\\nMe & my BF went at around 7pm, and parked in the back. It felt a little creepy, but still...papusas are calling, so we entered. \\n\\nIt's a no frills establishment, with a larger variety of foods and papusas than Eliana's. We shared the sampler (for comparisons) and some chicken leg entree...it really wasn't all that interesting. \\n\\nThe sampler plate was pretty similar to Eliana's, but they give you more (for more money, of course). The papusas, however, were the bomb (do people still use that term? Bomb?). WAAAAY better than Eliana's. And I'm told the ensalda drink was WAAAAY better too, but that is not my cup 'o tea. The tortillas served with the main entree were a little dry, so I'm siding with Eliana's tortillas. Serves was friendly, but not quite the waitress type service you get from Eliana's. We ordered up front, and then sat down. Then the food was brought to us. \\n\\nSo basically, I still like Eliana's more for their main dishes and tiny cup of chicken soup.

        "Review text:\nI havn't had enough opportunities to write a thorough review, but I can review a couple aspects.\\n\\nFirst, it was probably our fault for going to Brothers at 11 p.m. on the first Thursday of Spring semester. But seriously... a 2-hr wait in line, no joke, is no fun.\\n\\nWhat strikes me as fun about Brothers is that it occupies the 2nd and 3rd stories of a 3-story building. Part of the third floor is removed so you get a great open bar space which feels pretty roomy. The decor is bar-ish. \\n\\nThe bartenders were cute, and responsive to taking orders even though the room was pretty packed.\\n\\nI agree with some of the other reviewers that the people here are kind what you'd expect at any frat party... but then again, this is a bar on Green St.\\n\\nDrink selection is decent. Come for the unique bar setting, leave when you get sick of the people.\n\nStars:",

        "Review: Do not go to this cleaner if you expect the service they promise you on the phone!  They almost ruined my wedding due to their incompetence!    \\n\\nFor our wedding my husband and I flew to Las Vegas.  I needed to get my wedding dress pressed (not cleaned, just pressed) and I called Master Cleaners the week before we were to leave.  I explained that we would be flying into Vegas on a Friday and I needed the dress pressed no later than 10am the next morning.  I gave them the dates we would need their services, which happened to be good Friday and that Sat., and they said no problem.  They promised they would be able to get the dressed pressed and ready by 5pm that same day.  We flew in and headed straight to Master Cleaners.  Once there we were told that their pressers were not available due to the holiday and would not be back til Monday.  Obviously Monday was not going to work for me since our wedding was the next day.  They absolutely refused to help us even though they had promised to do so just a week early.  Well after running around to two other cleaners that were also not accepting business for the holiday and running up a very high taxi meter we decided to go back to the hotel and try to press the dress ourselves.  Thankfully my husband to-be knew how to use an iron (I thought they were decorative doorstops).  We managed to press the dress fairly well.  Moral of the story: watch out for any promises Master Cleaners' gives you!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The service was fine although the waiter didn't really seem to know much about the menu and I hate it when they deliver the food and have to ask who ordered what - isn't there supposed to be some sort of a system whereby they keep track of who ordered what at the table? \\n\\nThe calamari was overly breaded and rubbery, the spicy shrimp wasn't very spicy. My jambalaya was soupy and had too many vegetables and not enough seafood or sausage. My wife's steak was OK, but did not compare to what can be found at many steakhouses. Even the oysters on the half shell were just there, nothing special.\\n\\nThe one highlight of the meal was the ice-cream, brownie thing they brought for my birthday.\\n\\nAll in all, not enough positives to go back. I think we'll find a new place for future special events.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

The service at Ming's Pagoda was quick and the staff  was accomdating,  the food however was not good. \\n\\nThe egg drop soup was thick and lacked flavor and the wontons were stale and challenging to chew. On my first visit to Ming's Pagoda I had the lemon chicken. The lemon chicken was very disaponting. The coating was crunchy but the chicken was dry, not moist at all, and there was just to much lemon sauce placed over the chicken.\\n\\nMy lunch companion had the chicken lo mein.  The noodles were somewhat greasy and once again the chicken was dry. The fried rice, eggrolls, and fried wontons were equally disappointing.\\n\\nNot the best restaurant experience.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Yes folks, the chicken is good when they have it available but having to wait 30 minutes at 7:30 PM on a Sunday evening is uncalled for. That's what happened to me last evening. So instead I decided to have a fish sandwich($7.99) and beer battered mushrooms($4.99) and whatever you do DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID.\\nABSULUTELY THE WORST DINNER I'VE EVER HAD. It was INEDIBLE. The fish came on a bun so large that all I could taste was the bread. So I thought if I took the fish out of the bun I could at least taste the fish. WRONG! The fish had NO TASTE whatsover. I left half of it on the plate uneaten it was SO BAD! And I don't know what was inside the beer batter that were supposed to be mushrooms, but again I could taste nothing but the batter. They must chop the mushrooms in pieces because half of them were the size of an M&M peanut. TERRIBLE!!!!!!  When I left I told the staff it was the worst meal I've had in a long time and they told me the fish was their biggest seller. I won't be dining there ever again even for the chicken.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Tonight my boyfriend and his friend went to see a movie at Star Cinema.

I was really hungry and it wasn't bad. I would probably get something else next time, but that's just me.\\n\\nAnyways, after dinner I decided to try their herbal blueberry Rishi tea.

I didn't stay too long on the 1st floor where the women strippers are but I do remember seeing horrible tit jobs. I mean the boobs looked like missiles. I really don't get how men get off on ugly boobs but oh well.\\n\\nThe second floor are where the male strippers are. Amazingly I saw some cute strippers. My friend and I ended up having one stripper who kept on following us around which wasn't bad because he looked like Dean Cain (during his superman days). Around 2AM my friend and I wanted to leave and we were making our way out the door. All the sudden Mr Dean Cain look alike grabs my hand and asks if I wanted a good time. I was like WHAT?

The service is casual, you order at the counter and the food get delivered to you. This place looks like a deli. Big Deli case and little not so fancy tables and plenty of tables outside facing the parking lot.\\n\\nThis Delicatessen is Chicago Style with some traditional Jewish items. I've never been to Chicago but I met a friend from Chicago and she said this place serves food just like what she had in Chicago.\\n\\nI tried a Nova Lox and Cream Cheese on a toasted Bagel. The bagel was the first proper sized bagel I had in Arizona. It didn't have the East Coast Chew to it but hey this is Chicago Style in Arizona. The correct size was enjoyable to eat most bagels here are too big. The sandwich was good and everything in it was fresh.\\n\\nMy husband had the Pastrami on rye. The Rye bread was a good kind of rye and not that boring wimpy tasting Arizona Rye. I did get to taste a piece of the pastrami and it was prepared very carefully and was very succulent and juicy but very mildly seasoned almost but not quite and seemed closer in taste to East Coast Corned Beef. Not my style of pastrami but it was good and very fresh. The potato salad was seasoned nicely.\\n\\nService was friendly and helpful.\\n\\n3.5 stars My rating for this place is",

        "I went to Rosita's for the first time tonight after driving by it for about 20 years on my way to other establishments. Tonight was the night to try it out because a place we know we like looked really busy. The entry way was super crowded (not from being too busy) as customers who enter have to walk around the customers who are in line paying for their meals. It seemed like my kids were getting in people's way. I'll be the first to notice when my kids are being annoying, but in defense of their innocence on this occasion, I must say they had nowhere safe to stand as we waited for the hostess to return. My toddler was almost taken out by a bag of takeout food being offered to a customer standing in the very crowded foyer. How could I have explained that tragedy to his grandparents? \\n\\nWhen we were finally taken to the \\\"dining room\\\" I felt as if I had been magically swept away to a 1970's Waffle House. The lighting in this room -which consisted of ceiling fans and recessed can lights- could truly only be understood by folks who have found themselves in police interrogation rooms. The sunniness of the room does nothing for the ambiance, as it only makes patrons aware of how many crushed chips are on the floor and how the decor is reminiscent of the living room of an 85 year old \\\"winter visitor\\\" from Minneapolis. Normally the decor of a place isn't something I would critique, but I would expect something a little more pleasant when price range is considered. It's like being asked to pay the price of a bottle of Dom and instead receiving Boone's Farm Wine. No, it doesn't break the bank, but seriously, this is AZ; some of our best Mexican food is served on a paper plate. I would never critique these places for their lack of ambiance. This place, however, with their $6 (for one) shrimp taco, doesn't warrant the price tag. \\n\\nUpon being seated our waitress took our drink orders. I decided to have the chicken mole (12.95) and my husband had the green chili chimi dinner (10.95). I think the kids' meals were a...\nSo I would like to give it",

Bring cash or expect to pay over $10 each time as that is their credit card limit. \\n\\nThere wasn't much selection. I bought two Danishes and cookies. The Danish seemed overly dry and a tad stale. \\n\\nThere is a large assortment of packaged European products that I assume is a big draw.

I have several pieces of clothing that are Kate Smith's collection from a few years back to present, that are made well, has kept their shape and have worn well.  I am impressed each time I pull out one of them to wear.\\n\\nI also like coming in to find the racks of mark downs, and this trip, found many summer tops marked down to $3 bucks. I don't mind this, as living in the desert, it seems those summer tops can still be worn well into the fall and winter months.\\n\\nI also like the jewelry department, I don't want to spend a fortune for a simple gold hoop I wear almost daily.

None of that simply boiled with clarified butter stuff. The fish was also very good and cooked right. The roasted pork had a wonderful crisp on the skin but the section we got had too much fat and not enough muscle..and the grease sopped down into the plate so it was hard to eat.  We wanted the 2nd tier ($36) family set but they were out of clams so we asked if she could just subtract the price of the clams or to let us know what the total price would be. The waitress gave a stank face and just walked away and never acknowledged us again until our food came a long time later. Price for 3 items separately was the same as the 4-item family deal...wth. We compensated with a lesser tip.\\n\\nThe rice was obviously old and not reheated enough to even be warm. Utensils have that film over it that stays when not properly scrubbed. I was handed a set of chopsticks with just one stick.  People just walk up to the counter and grab their own boxes, forks, crab crackers etc.  \\n\\nCome here expecting good, authentic food but knowing the waitress hates the world and that you'll have to wait to eat, even when not very busy. I'll be back for that lobster though.\n\nStars:",

        "I came with some out-of-town family, and overall, I thought Porta Bella was pretty bad. \\n\\nFirst Impression: \\nPorta Bella kind of comes across as a hole-in-the-wall -- you could easily walk past it and not really realize what's there. I enjoyed the atmosphere (secluded tables, intimate lighting) and their separate rooms -- we were in the \\\"Rose Room\\\", although you would never know it with the million roses on the wallpaper. \\n\\nBooze: \\nI had an Old Fashioned to start off the night, and it was pretty bad. Maybe I've just become spoiled to how other places make them (namely, the Old Fashioned), but I was pretty disappointed. The wine list seemed to be very small, although I don't drink very much wine so I was okay with that aspect. The wine that was paired with my meal was very good, however. \\n\\nFood: \\nI had an overall decent impression with my meal (Shrimp and Scallops with Tomato Vodka Sauce), but my wife absolutely hated her meal. The seafood was cold and rubbery, the sauce was cold, etc. My review has been tempered to reflect her poor experience.\\n\\nOverall, Porta Bella seems to be hit-or-miss. I want to give it another shot before I write it off, as I had an okay time, but my expectations have now been significantly lowered.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

But I Asked about process since I wanted a cocktail as well. Waiter will be there shortly. And he was!

        "Review: This review is about the bathrooms. I visited Las Vegas in December and went shopping with my mom and grandma. With me being pregnant, of course we went to Babies R Us and of COURSE I had to pee. \\nThe first major issue isn't this particular store's fault but it IS a huge design flaw. You have a store that caters to pregnant women, right? So why is the bathroom ALL THE WAY AT THE BACK of your GIANT STORE?!?!?!?! Why should I have to coax my poor bladder into holding it another minute to get to the back of the store?\\nAnd here is the big issue that I had with this store. I am about to pee my pants, baby is kicking on my bladder with full force, I finally walk back to the bathroom and it is the most DISGUSTING bathroom I had been into in a loooong time. There were several open stalls but 3 out of 5 of them had poop or pee SMEARED on their seats. Another stall had feminine hygiene products (used) on the floor. And the smell. A store for pregnant women should go out of their way to make the bathroom look and smell nice. Our hormones are out of control and our pregnant sense of smell is insane.\\nSo...if you visit this one, try to go with an empty bladder.\\nOh, and also, you can't try their Motherhood Maternity clothes on, even the bras, so you may want to maternity shop somewhere else.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I say \\\" my cone?\\\"  He looks at the big bright screen with the order and  says \\\" oh ya \\\".  Gives me my cone.

        "Not too good, not too bad.  My husband and I ordered the salt & pepper calamari, clams in black bean sauce and sesame chicken.  The calamari was pretty good, a little overrated but came out nice and crispy w/ salt and red pepper seasoning and some sliced Serrano peppers that were hella spicy.  The clams in black bean sauce wasn't that good, the sauce was super salty (we ordered it after reading all the rave reviews on it).  The sesame chicken was good, it's our safe go to dish whenever we eat Chinese food.  Our bill came out to $47.24 including a HongKong iced tea that was never refilled, a little disappointing since it cost $3.75.  Perhaps I'm just cheap but I'm used to paying $2.50~ for iced tea w/ unlimited refills.  Another disappointment was the cleanliness, lots of dust on the wood window sills along the restaurant.  Makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like.  Better get to cleaning before Darcy Spears hits them up and they end up on Action 13 new's Dirty Dining!  Eeeks.\nSo I would like to give it",

Or maybe I made the mistake of asking my Lebanese taxi driver where to get good Vietnamese.  Or maybe I just should have stuck with Chinese food in Chinatown...... My rating for this place is",

        "Review text:\nDisappointed with their follow through. \\n\\nContacted these guys about having work done. They came out quickly to give a quote, prices were average and we then gave the go ahead on a Friday. \\n\\nI had to question them with any sort of time frame of when they would be coming out. The response I received was \\\"Sometime next week, Tuesday or Wednesday, I'll call you before were coming out.\\\" Still a vague appointment, but manageable. \\n\\nWednesday afternoon rolled around and I hadn't received a phone call. Called the guy I previously spoke with and wanted to touch base on when they would be coming out. He responded with \\\"Uhhh I'm on a motorcycle right now I'll have to call you next week.\\\" I questioned the next week and was very confused, it was only Wednesday and he basically responded with some \\\"we got pushed behind\\\" generic response. I expressed I was very disappointed considering we needed this work done before the following Monday, and now they obviously wouldn't be making that deadline. Waiting a week just to get another possible phone call is very unprofessional business. \\n\\nThey were hardly apologetic, didn't even offer to confirm an appointment for next week, it was just another \\\"ill call you\\\". After I explained we were on a deadline he finally apologized and I declined having them call next week to then set an appointment.\\n\\nAnyway, whether it be the case or not with them getting behind, I'm very disappointed with the lack of communication. Please call your clients and update their status. I shouldn't have to call and retrieve updates, and sit here wondering when this company is going to come do my yard. Horrible follow through, and I'll be finding another company that can do the work they commit to, when they say they will. Freeing up your schedule and willing to spend a lot of money for a company that stiffs you is ridiculous.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Let me say first off, that I'm a cheese lover. Daughter of tried and true New England types, there aint nothin' better than extra sharp Vermont cheddar or my Swiss brother in law's homemade fondue. So when my now-unfortunate ex and I got pregnant 3 weeks after the blissful wedding event, we went to The Melting Pot to celebrate. It was a repeat visit and I've more recently been to the Phoenix location [Ray Rd]. I echo the reports of others: alot of money, alot of time and not particularly genius. It's a nice 'experience' . I think its okay fondue, I'd pass on the meat course and since liquid chocolate isn't really my thing, I'd just go for the cheese course. \\n\\nGiven that, I can stay home and make my own Welsh Rarebit and wait for the next time my brother in law is in town and save myself some serious time and money.\nSo I would like to give it",
