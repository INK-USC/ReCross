        "Review text:\nFirst off, my wife and I are 'die hard' Target fans, so it pains me a bit to write this review. I will be taking my business elsewhere after my experience tonight. \\n\\nThe intent of our visit to Target this evening was to buy a new grill. However, instead of leaving with a state of the art grilling machine, I left the store empty handed, with a bad attitude, and with a terrible taste in my mouth. \\n\\nWhen we walked back to the area of the store where this Target displays their grills, the area was being remodeled for new products to be displayed. But there were a couple of nice grills out on display, one of which, I planned on purchasing for nearly $300. \\n\\nI asked an employee for help and he mentioned \\\"I don't work that area\\\" and he called someone over who would help, apparently. The gentleman came over, I asked him general questions about price and availability which he was unsure of both. I asked if I could purchase the floor model and he replied \\\"we can't sell the display model because of liability concerns.\\\" \\n\\nWhy would you put products out on display that you can't sell? I was going to spend $300 just like that...but this Target doesn't need the additional revenue apparently.\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nI gave it a second shot. Much better. See the taste review below. \\n\\nWhen it comes to coffee places, you know what you will get at a place like Starbucks or Crazy Mocha, but finding a local spot just adds to the overall experience that the previous two cannot provide. As far as local Pittsburgh coffee spots go, so far this is at the middle if the pack but worth visiting in downtown. Especially since it is in market square. I am a sucker for history and want to try Nicholas's again. There is a large selection of coffee, for boutique type prices for some. The daily coffee my second time was much better but still if you have been in existence since 1919 I would expect a great product, or one that is different from all the rest due to your almost 100 years. \\n\\nThe 5 senses review:\\n\\nSight: 8-the main saving grace. It is really cool, quaint, and charming. This is where the history helps. \\n\\nSmell: 6-just like other coffee places it is always nice to walk in and get nailed with the aroma of the brewed and ground beans. \\n\\nTaste: 6- UPDATED! Much better coffee of the day. So lesson learned. Get a \\\"coffee of the day\\\" at your own risk. \\n\\nSound: 3-remember a low number is good. Nice and relaxed with the just the sounds of a working coffee shop. No over powering shitty music, thankfully!\\n\\nTouch: 2-only because you aren't really using your hands for anything. I did get a biscotti there which was very good. So since I used my hands I need to add some rating.\n\nReview rating:",

NOT for weather reasons but for \\\"technical\\\" issues. After the 14 h delay + 10 h flight I request to be invited to the JFK Sky lounge as compensation for the damages and exhaustion. The answer is $50. Completely obnoxious service. After obviously missing my connection I get re-booked on a flight  with a 6 h layover at JFK (!). Which again got delayed 3 h because of a \\\"broken pump\\\". Finally get in the plane and arrive to Phoenix (2 days after!) and my checked luggage is not there. \\n\\nDelta Airlines planes are old and falling apart, out of 4 planes I took with them this Christmas, 2 had technical problems. Their customer service is down the drain and when you board and watch their welcome video you have to hear from their CEO that their number 1 priority is our safety and \\\"comfort\\\". Haha Don't make me laugh blood suckers. \\n\\nThis is a rolling down the hill airline, which most likely will not be around in 5 years. \\n\\nOne of the very few times I've flown Delta and certainly the last. \\n\\nI have already contacted a law firm to start the economic compensation process for the delay on both flights. \\n\\nNo mercy with this obnoxious people.\n\nReview rating:",

        "My second go round for Thai food, the first a long long time ago as a child turning my nose up at the food and refusing to eat it.  This time, not so bad, I am able to read and I know what stuff is.  Still coming here I was weary of what to get so I kept it simple with sweet and sour pork or was it chicken?  I can't remember and honestly I couldn't tell.  All I know it was chewy and sweet and not at all spicy like I had dreaded.  \\n\\nThe restaurant was beautiful and all the staff was dressed to the nines.  I loved the traditional Thai garb the staff was wearing and all the big bosses were equally well dressed in business suits.  The staff was also very attentive with removing dishes and getting the orders in.  In a group of five and one late arrival, with tons of appetizers and dishes abound the manager took our order without a note pad and got everything right.  Very impressive. \\n\\nI doubt I'd come back here on my own because I'm not a fan of spicy and it seems they have a lot of stuff I'm allergic to in a bunch of the dishes.  Even the sweet and sour um, whatever it was had tomato in it.  The Thai iced tea was pretty good.  My friend mentioned it's either something you really love or something you really hate.  To me it was something I could really like.  Nice place and super busy but the staff handled it like real professionals.  I would recommend it if your up north and in the mood for Thai food.

        "Review: It's nary Halloween time, and that means shopping for fake blood, wigs, decorations, costumes and costume accoutrements (pirate swords, bullet wounds, sunglasses, stage glue, fake teeth...)\\n\\nEvery year since I found out about this little costume/party store I've hit it up no less than 3 times - usually more - between early September and up to Halloween day. It's got just about everything you would need from a party store like the standard balloons for a birthday, novelty tiaras that say \\\"Mother-To-Be\\\", themed plates, and my favorite stuff like several kinds of fake blood and amputated hands, scars and scabs... They have rent-able costumes of better quality, and the standard cheap ones that come in a bag and fit like a burlap sack.\\n\\nIf you think you need a wig for your costume - THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO. Why? Because they about 50, and YOU CAN TRY THEM ON before you buy. They have sample ones out on mannequin heads to see what you like, then you buy the not-messed-with one in a bag - awesome.\\n\\nIt's pretty small, and nothing compared to those Spirit warehouse-size stores that pop up every year. BUT I keep coming because they've never let me down and aren't nearly as crowded as Spirit gets mid-October.\\n\\nSo, if you find yourself in need of a pimp hat this Halloween (I hope you're more inspire and creative than that) or party supplies off-season, I highly recommend this place!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

This is not their original location, but I don't think it is too far from where they were at first.\\n\\nIt is located by the little strip shopping center on the corner of South Blvd & Tyvola road and can be easy to miss the first time you go. \\n\\nIf you have eaten at the BBQ King on Wilkinson and liked their food, you'll like this place... the food is about the same but it is a sit-down restaurant housed in a former fast-food joint. \\n\\nOn the menu, you will find BBQ (minced or sliced), French Fries, Onion Rings, Burgers, Fried Chicken, Fried Fish, Hamburger Steak, Coleslaw and that sort of thing. \\n\\nThey do have the take-out window in operation, but I think that is only for call-ahead orders. \\n\\nWhen I am in the mood for a good onion ring but don't have time to go all the way to BBQ King on Wilkinson, this is the place to go. \\n\\nPrices are cheap, but just about everything here is fried, so if you're trying to eat healthier fare, you might want to think twice before you stop in. \\n\\nTheir sweet tea is pretty sweet - if you are a native from NC, SC, or GA, you might like it.

        "I went to Lidia's this past week for dinner with a group of 6 friends. The service was one of the worst I have ever had. The waitress was rude to us from the minute we didn't order alcohol to the second we signed our bills. We politely asked at the time of placing our orders if it would be possible to have separate checks. It's a group of people having dinner together, who carries cash anymore?  Waitstaff should expect to be asked for separate checks. I understand it makes for a bit more work to run a few more cards at the end of the meal, but when the waitress disdainfully states \\\"I can do that, but you will just have to be patient with me at the end of your meal as separate checks cannot disrupt the service of my other tables.\\\" it is a big indication of how the rest of the evening would go. If she gave as much inattention to her other tables as she did to ours, no one would have even noticed she was taking a few extra minutes running separate checks. We rarely saw our waitress except when she needed to sell us food. Thank goodness for the other staff that were available to refill our drinks, our bread and our pasta. Otherwise I think we would still be sitting there 4 days later with empty glasses and stomachs!\\n\\nSpeaking of empty stomachs-I wish I hadn't filled my stomach and emptied my wallet with the food we were served. I ordered the pasta trio. The salad was good and unfortunately the best part of my meal.  I was excited to try the 3 pastas when they came out. But that excitement quickly disappeared as I took a few bites. Seriously?!  A revered Italian restaurant serving overdone pasta?!  It was the most bland arrabiatta sauce I have ever had. The jarred stuff I have in my cabinet at home has a 100 times more flavor than this and I don't even serve that over such limp noodles as what this place did. The pesto sauce on the gnocchi was good, but again the pasta was well past it's doneness. The best pasta was the gemmeli with the sausage/broccoli rabe sauce, but it was extremely oversalted and left my...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Yay dinner!!!\\n\\nIt's no big secret that I'm a huge fan of Chris Bianco. His simple honest to goodness approach to food is not only inspiring but down right delicious. If you're one of his fans who don't mind waiting 4 hours for one of his amazing pies at Pizzeria Bianco, then you're in for a real treat. While they don't serve pizza, one of my all time favorites, Pane Bianco is now serving dinner and no serious wait either! In addition to ordering one of their famous sandwiches, you can expect an ever changing menu of rustic Italian inspired plates.\\n\\nIf you've been to Pane you know the drill, go in, order at the counter then either decide to take your score home, or eat there on one of the communal outdoor tables. No wine or beer is served at this time but there is talk of Pane expanding into the Lux Coffee space next door which will eventually offer inside seating and hopefully wine by the glass. If all of this goes down, Lux will simply move to the adjacent building also getting a larger space. For me Bianco's food just screams for a glassed of red wine.\\n\\nOrdering the Crespelle ($12) had me really excited due to the unique nature of the dish itself. Basically an Italian crepe made the garbanzo bean flour; it's filled with luscious ricotta cheese, hints of spinach then bathed in a slightly sweet tomato sauce. It was clear that after the first bite I was in love with this dish, I simply couldn't stop though glares from my dining companions made me to relinquish the plate. \\n\\nI can't sing enough praises for Biancos Housemade Mozzarella ($8), thick slabs of hand pulled cheese is paired with fresh tomatoes, a few leaves of basil, olive oil and a sprinkling of salt, that's it. The resulting texture and flavor is so toothsome and fresh that I've yet to have another as good. The salad comes with bread which I put to good use soaking up every drop of the salads milky elixir. \\n\\nServed on house made flat bread, the Soppressata with Aged Provolone ($8) which also comes topped with a healthy shave of Parmesan...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "We took my wife's Sorento into for service on her A/C for the first time in March. They told us it was her compressor and they replaced it. Luckily we had a extended warranty and they covered most of it. That didn't work so we took it back. They said it was a bad control unit and wanted $600+ to replace it. I found it online for just over $400 and I replaced it myself. That didn't fix it so we took it back again. They said it was a bad control module and that they were going to replace it. They charged us for the replacement but didn't replace it and then determined it was a bad replacement control unit. They ordered a warranty replacement and I picked it up (much to their disappointment) and put it in myself. That didn't work either and after spending over $1000 and wasting two plus months with them we took it to Dale Jarrett Kia in Monroe. They determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time. They were able to get Kia to warranty TWO new control units that were damaged because the module had burned the other two out. They had it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem. Folger Kia has got to be the worse dealership in the Charlotte area. We spoke directly with Kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible Folger Kia was and how badly they treated us. My wife went in when we were finished dealing with Folger to get a receipt to give to Dale Jarrett and Mike Melton treated her horribly. I will NEVER use or recommend Folger Kia to anyone. They are dishonest and their customer service is terrible. If you have to use a Kia dealer go to Dale Jarrett. It isn't that far but your experience will be so much better.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nAfter going to a few bridal boutiques in the area, with no luck and unappealing service, I came across a couple beautiful, reasonably priced bridal gowns online at Group USA. I had never heard of the company before and discovered that there was a store in the Charlotte area. With skepticism and worry, from my first few bridal boutique experiences, I was feeling uneasy and preparing myself for the worst, yet again. But this wasn't the case. I was greeted by an extremely friendly front desk clerk who introduced me to a cheerful and helpful bridal associate who had the dresses pulled for me that I called about the evening before. She was prepared and eager to help me find what I was looking for; bringing me different sizes and offering me advice. I felt that the dresses were made very well and that the fabric and material was better than any I have seen. The price of the dress that I chose was a lot cheaper than any other dress I had tried on...almost half the price. I had a wonderful experience at Group USA in Concord NC, and would reccommend it to anyone who is looking for a beautiful dress, inexpensive price, and friendly service.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nDr. Simpson is the best dentist I have ever been to.\\n\\nAnd I have been to my fair share of dentists.  First off, I am a bit of a freak when it comes to oral hygiene.  Second, I am missing teeth.\\n\\nNot that you can tell, and all thanks to Dr. Simpson.  The story of why I am missing teeth is a long and agonizing one (it involves childhood trauma, something called root resorption, and even the Peace Corps believe it or not).\\n\\nAnyhow, long story short, I needed to get an old bridge replaced and I had to pay out of pocket to do so.  To make matters even more interesting, I had to have a tooth pulled AND get a root canal.  This entire process could have been a nightmare, but it wasn't and that is thanks entirely to Dr. Simpson and his always excellent staff.  On one occasion I was having extreme pain, and Dr. Simpson saw me in his office during his vacation (He even had to bring his daughter in with him!  Who does that?!  Dr. Simpson!  That's who!).  He is very sensitive to pain and ensures that even the most routine visit is as pleasant as it gets.\\n\\nMost importantly, my teeth look great and almost everyone is surprised when I tell them that they are false (many of them, anyhow).\\n\\nIf you want to go to a great dentist, someone who will make your smile look great, won't hurt you, will take the time to hear about your problems...you HAVE to go to Dr. Simpson.\n\nStars:",

        "Review: This is my hot dog heaven.  I have been coming here for years only for their Whooli's Jumbo dog with chili, cheddar cheese, and lots and lots of onions.  It's sad that this is the only thing I get, the owner, Guy, knows that's the only thing I order.  He's determined to get me to try something else, but how can I say no to so much deliciousness?  \\n\\nThe place has moved from their original spot, and I quite enjoy the new place. The bar is a lot bigger, and they have a few tv's located around the restaurant for you to watch a game while waiting for your take out.  I love the little detail at the bar that they have their little Irish man ironed/burned (?) into the wood of the bar.  Small details like that are nice.  The place has a homey feel that you're just chilling with friends.  Some of the tables there are picnic tables, so I like that.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere is friendly, but sometimes it felt like it can get a little too loud.  But everyone is just there for a good time, so no hard feelings.  There's is also a pool table located there which you can test your skills at.  \\n\\nTry this place out if you're looking for a nice relaxing bar to wind down at for the end of the day!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I would never have assumed that I'd have so many options for pho in Phoenix. Looking on Yelp, quite a few Vietnamese restaurants were received very well. I settled on Da Vang, which turned out to be exactly the kind of place I picture when I think of a pho restaurant. Well, the outside was a little more plain than necessary.\\n\\nBut you can't read a book by its cover, you know. Da Vang was actually having a lunch rush, with people coming in and out all the while. The decor is nothing fancy. The chair I was sitting on was pretty worn out, and the brown walls could use repainting. It's definitely a place with history.\\n\\nDa Vang has a big menu with all the standard fare, plus some family meals (Chinese dishes), banh mi (for only $2.50!) and even lau (Vietnamese hot pot). Pho was really cheap here, ranging from $4.75-5.50 for regular sizes and an extra $1.50 for large. I had my usual pho tai nam, at $5.25, and it came out in five minutes.\\n\\nFor the first time ever, the pho arrived before my garnishes, though they were delivered soon after. The first taste of the broth was pleasing. It was light and clear, with a skilled use of spices. I thought it had the perfect degree of saltiness, and it was a little tangy even without lime. As for the meat, the rare steak was almost fully cooked, unsurprising because it was placed under the flank steak. Personally, I would have put it on top, but what do I know? The slices of flank were the fattiest ones I've ever eaten, too. Regardless, both types of meat were tender and had good flavor. The noodles were cooked to perfection, too.\\n\\n\\nRating Breakdown:\\n\\nTaste (11/14):\\nBroth flavor- 4/5\\nNoodle & meat quality- 4/5\\nGarnish selection- 1/2\\nPortion size- 2/2\\n\\nRestaurant (12/16):\\nService- 3/5\\nCleanliness- 4/5\\nAtmosphere- 3/4\\nSpeed of arrival- 2/2\\n\\nTotal: 23/30\\n\\nRead more about my phoventures at www.phoacrossamerica.com\nSo I would like to give it",

        "When you read the menu, things sound promising, but nothing I tried ever tasted even half as good as it sounded. \\n\\nI've tried the veggie burger, the grilled cheese, and the barbecue chicken sandwich (along with maybe one or two specials), and all of them left me feeling mildly queasy. Too much grease? Spices that don't agree with me? I don't know. Even the fries disappointed me. \\n\\nIn addition to the blah food, I'm still annoyed with their inconsideration as neighbors. I lived above them for a year, and I wanted to smash my head into the wall most nights. Ultra-repetitive music - I swear the only thing their bartenders listened to in 2005/2006 was \\\"Sweet Caroline\\\" (ONCE A NIGHT IS ENOUGH, three made me think about coming in and ripping the speakers down) and The Killers' first album. Also, they routinely left the music on full-blast until 5 am. I expected noise until bar time, but pounding bass til sunrise during the week, not so much. \\n\\nRanting aside, they get two stars instead of one because the food is edible (not good, but edible) and they can accommodate large groups.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nMy son has been in attendance at MMAC for more than 5 years now, and changes have certainly taken place within the organization.  This dojo is deliberate in creating a balance between kata, kumite (sparring), and basics.  It is also set as a traditional Japanese dojo teaching Wado Ryu Karate.  This is not a cut-throat plaza mall dojo, like the Cobra Kai in \\\"Karate Kid\\\", that teaches students to harm each other and fight as a primary resource to resolving a physical confrontation.  If you are looking for a fight club, look elsewhere.\\n\\nThat being said, my son specializes in fighting here and does very well.  He has participated in over 30 tournaments in AZ, CA, UT, CO, and NV.  He has won several of these, and usually medals at every event. He is part of a competition team that takes extra time to train in fighting and competing.  I am confident in his abilities.\\n\\nThe dojo is restructuring, and growing, and all for the better.  It has the best workshops, training clinics, guest speakers, and REAL tournament training by far.  I couldn't be more proud to recommend it to anyone looking for polished and professional, traditional Japanese technique and practical self-defense instruction.\n\nReview rating:",

You are so close to them, its a more intimate setting and the performers are more personal. Loved that!\\n\\nFirst impression- Dirty and cheap....just the way I like it! Lol \\n\\nThe place is pretty much fueled by PBR and young, society-loathing degenerates....its not the crowd for everyone but for what we were there for it was perfectly fine. \\n\\nFor a concert the sound is great, the layout is good for a music venue as it allows for people to not be trampled, and you could get very close to the performers which was neat! The staff was all very funny and nice which was great. \\n\\nTips:\\nGO SEE FRANK TURNER, you will not regret it.\\nDon't park in Keith and Ginger's spot (especially on a Fri or Sat)\\nFeel free to bathe before going.....its close quarters, don't be offensive.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

After not being forced to dine here for several years I came (with the family of course) on a Sunday afternoon a few weeks ago.  The menu's changed since 1995 but the food and service are still sub par.\\n\\nWe started off with the spinach dip in a \\\"brioche\\\" bread bowl.  First of all, don't insult my intelligence.  I can tell the difference between brioche and a sourdough bread bowl from Safeway. This appetizer was reminiscent of something I would've brought to a potluck ten years ago. \\n\\nMy sister got the lobster ravioli. Definitely a two star dish.  The sunrise sauce (creamy tomato sauce) was OK but the ravioli lacked any type of flavor - lobster or otherwise.\\n\\nMy brother got the penne quatro formaggio. This was actually the best thing on the menu but it was just glorified macaroni and cheese.  Don't try to trick us common Mesa folk with your fancy Italian. \\n\\nMom got the spaghetti and meat sauce.  I didn't taste it because once I smelled it I didn't need to. Ugh.\\n\\nI got the berry and candied walnut salad.  The spring mix was old and it was nothing special.  I was just going for the least disgusting and calorie laden item on the menu.  Mission accomplished. \\n \\nService was unremarkable - drinks were refilled but she was MIA quite a bit.   \\n\\nEating here reminds me of Thanksgiving.

        "Review text:\nI typically really like Houlihan's, but my recent experience at this location left a lot to be desired.  We wandered in on a Tuesday night and managed to get a table right away as it wasn't crowded.  After perusing the massive menu, my brother and I decided that we'd get some appetizers to share.\\n\\nWe started with the nachos - they were just OK.  They were topped with ground chicken that seemed to be completely unseasoned.  We both ate around the chicken.  It was also an odd gray color, but I won't dwell on that.  Then we opted to try a couple of sliders and the Houlihan's version of the \\\"poutine.\\\"  The sliders were decent, but the poutine was awful.  It's fries topped with their pot roast and gravy and some cheese.  The fries were obviously straight out of the freezer and hadn't been cooked quite long enough so they weren't crispy at all.  They also appeared to not have stuck the entire dish in the oven, but just topped the undercooked fries with the gravy and pot roast, and then some cheese.  So the cheese wasn't melted, and it was all just kind of gross.  It was really disappointing.\\n\\nAnd then finally we got the bill - we each had 2 glasses of wine, and 3 appetizers and it was $70?  No thanks.  I can think of many other places to spend less of my money on much better food.\n\nReview rating:",

I'm a medium-rare and he's a medium, and they were accurately cooked.\\n\\nThe burger meat was a little bland, and it seems like they use a frozen beef patty based on the shape. They offer a lot of ways to dress it up to make up for this. We got a fried egg on one, and sauteed mushrooms on the other.\\n\\nVeggies were crisp, bun was buttered and soft. \\n\\nFries were salty and tasted best when completely coated in ketchup. \\n\\nPickle was dill-icious, which is a joke I'm pretty sure has never been told before.\\n\\nMy guy's fruit punch was completely watered down by the time it arrived. I would recommend getting all drinks no ice and adding ice when you're ready to enjoy the drinks.\\n\\nAlso, ordered an iced coffee. Standard, passable coffee. Pretty cool that it's delivered.\\n\\nBottom line: Menu is expansive. Burger and fries were average. Delivery is fairly priced and quick.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

And cleaning off the door and window sills? \\n\\nThe last two times I have been at the Highland Avenue location I have had poor service. Today was (again) a poor experience. Even after specifically asking that they clean the bugs off the front end (assuming they would do the rest of car without being asked) I still had to ask (again) at the end to please wipe off the bugs.  Last time the car did not even looked like it had been washed.  Just the top/superficial dirt was removed. \\n\\nThe attitude of the workers is that they are doing me a big favour by wiping off my car - and I always tip when they are finished so it's not like I am being overly picky. Additionally - when you have three or four workers all speaking Spanish and all of them looking at me, snickering, pointing at the car and then looking at me, laughing and the young lady actually rolling her eyes; well being rude to the customer and not making me feel welcome when the car was not clean is inexcusable.\\n\\nIt was just after 8:45 this morning that I was there.  You were NOT busy - there was not a big line and you had plenty of workers in the finishing area.  Seems like 4 or 5 guys were quite happy to work on shining up a large white Humvee that was there for over 30 minutes while the (less than) 10 minutes spent on my Mariner was half-hearted and sloppy. The mirror inside was dirty and pushed all the way to one side - I thought the idea was to put the mirror back in an approximation of where it was when the customer gets back in? Both seats in front were moved and the passenger seat was wet. The center console area had not even been cursorily wiped, and the areas inside all the door and windows was filthy and looked to have never even been touched,.  This is the same sloppy work the last time I was there.\\n\\nI have had to ask a couple of times in the past to get the car wiped...\n\nReview rating:",

        "It's a Westin, you pretty much know the deal if you stay at them often- but they do vary a bit in terms of overall quality, though Charlotte leans a bit toward the low end for a Westin, I'm afraid. It is a sleek, newish building with the cool, polished feel that most Westin's throw down. The Ember Grille was nearly empty at dinnertime, and the environment was cold and stark. You would think something with \\\"ember\\\" in its name would emit a bit of warmth in its ambiance. The menu seemed a little limited, and we were starving and I was getting cranky so we actually opted for the bar for appetizers while we decided what to do. I highly recommend the \\\"10\\\" sampler, which included small bites of rare ahi, goat cheese quesadilla, buffalo wings, hummus and smoked salmon. Great deal for $14. J got a delicious Kobe burger and we relaxed in the spacious bar, and soaked in the cocktail hour jazz piano. Room service was just okay. The staff was all very pleasant with the exception of the disinterested waiter in the bar; strangest service I may have ever encountered. I think maybe he was trying to pull off some sort of NYC attitude schtick in Charlotte. It was amusing at least. Nice stay, nice location. No MSNBC, this and the waiter cost them a star.

While the decor was generically bad \\\"down-home\\\" from the 80's, the staff was very nice and seated us in a side room with plenty of space for all of us.\\n\\nThe meal started with homemade bread which was warm and soft. This gave me hope that the meal wouldn't be in keeping with the general feel of the place. Alas, my hope was not long lived and I soon felt like an Obama supporter watching McCain win the election.\\n\\nAfter ordering, I made my way to the salad bar. This seemed quaint, considering that salad bars aren't really popular anymore, unless you're at Souper Salad or Sweet Tomatoes. The salad bar was not entirely scary, but wasn't anything worth going back to. I'm fairly certain everything came out of a can, bag, bottle or box. The freshest thing may have been the red onion, which obviously had been poorly sliced by hand.\\n\\nMoving on to the main course, I had Mother's Meat Loaf dinner. My meat loaf came with rice pilaf and green beans. Once again, food from cans and boxes made an appearance, as my beans were canned and my rice must have come from a box mix. The meatloaf was actually made from non-canned meat, but wasn't all that exciting. It had been cooked with ketchup slathered on top, yet was served with gravy on the side (probably originally made from a powder mix). I ate most of my dinner because I was hungry, not because of the quality.\\n\\nHoping for a come-from-behind win in a big electoral state, I ordered pie for dessert. They tout their homemade pies, but seem to think that \\\"homemade\\\" means making pie from canned ingredients. My cherry pie was not spectacular, as the preprocessed cherry filling was encased in crust which attempted to be light, flaky and buttery, but only managed to be dry and chewy.\\n\\nMy Mother's was saved from a one-star rating by two things...the graciousness and patience of the staff, and the low prices.

        "Such a waste. Great little cozy Mexican restaurant for a business lunch that somehow forgot 1) how to make Mexican food and 2) how to cater to larger groups on their lunch break.\\n\\nYou will fall in love with its quaint, wooden interior and carafes of salsa, but the love affair will start to wain once you realize how shoddy and unorganized the service is. It's one of those serve tables by committee places where no one will claim responsibility of any table that's out there. As such, you will go through long stretches without key elements for eating your meal and either be ignored or treated rudely when you ask for help.\\n\\nBut the real deal-breaker for me in my one (and probably final) trip here was the food. I got a \\\"Carne Asada Taco\\\" platter, which turned out to be a loose definition for what I got. There was a stack of four tiny, over-saturated tortillas with some carne asada on it. No guacamole, no pico, or anything else. Just some carne asada and lettuce on sticky, wet tortillas. Also came with almost tasteless beans and rice on the side.\\n\\nThe carne asada itself was really good and some members of my party had slightly better entrees, including the ones who got carne asada burritos which were loaded with guac and such, but we all agreed it wasn't worth the price compared to a trip to Tradiciones, La Tolteca, or even Canasta.\\n\\nThen we got presented with a bill that included an auto-gratuity of almost 30%. We brought it up to the woman who was running the joint for the most part and took our orders and told her to sort that out. She apologizied and said, \\\"Oh, she can put on whatever gratuity she wants.\\\" \\n\\nSay what? Who is \\\"she\\\"? You are the only one running the register and taking orders. And how can any server just come up with a gratuity of 30%? Needless to say this place is trying to shakedown large business parties and should be avoided as much as possible.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "one day i was shopping in one of my favorite stores, LUSH, and i noticed one of the employees had GORGEOUS curls. i complimented her on them and started in with the usual styling product questions. she briefly told me what she used but credited her amazing curls to her stylist, lauren williams at leidan mitchell salon.\\n\\ni took down the number, but i held on to it for a while before calling. i was loyal to my current stylist. after a few times of inability to coordinate an appointment with her, i gave up and decided it was the perfect time to try out someone new.\\n\\nit took me a few tries to get in with lauren because our schedules are pretty much opposite, but when i finally did it was worth it. i told her i needed a change and basically gave her free reign over my hair. i went from blonde to red, and i never thought of myself as a redhead but i love it. i don't think i've gotten so many compliments on my hair in my life!\\n\\nmy next trip she chopped my hair (at my request) and gave me amazing bangs. i never thought i could even wear bangs with my coarse thick curls, but she showed me how to style them and make it work.\\n\\nlauren is amazing! she even texts me to follow up a few days after my appointment to make sure i'm happy with my hair. i highly recommend her.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I went to Juan's yesterday with some friends from work. When we got back they asked us how it was. It was okay. \\n\\nI was pretty underwhelmed with the service, chips, and salsa- all pretty bland. My chimichanga was okay, big and beefy, pretty difficult to mess up. The guacamole was weird though, really thin and pureed, possibly from a mix even. The beans and rice were standard, and everything came in very big portions, including the soft drinks which are roughly the size of a small bucket! I liked my friends green chile plate much better than what I got, which is why Juan's gets a generous third star, otherwise, this place would be a solid 2 stars. \\n\\nIt is really, super cheap and they don't scrimp on the AC (it was about 60 degrees in there!) Some people probably like that, I think it makes my food go cold way too fast. Would I go again? Meh. Maybe. If I was in front of it and felt like big, cheap Mexican food- otherwise there are many other places I would opt for.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "If you need somewhere cheap to stay for a night this place is fine.  I however recently completed an extended stay here and the longer you stay, the more the bloom will be off that rose.  Allow me to explain.\\n\\nThe building is just a wreck.  In no particular order I enjoyed the following \\\"surprises\\\" while there:  Pool closed due to cloudy/green, hot tub broken, fitness room useless due to all equipment broken/vandalized, flooding in hallways, power outages, water dripping from ceiling, A/C in my room basically had two modes (on or off), pet \\\"messes\\\" everywhere, broken elevator, and fire alarms that no one knew how to turn off.  \\n\\nThe clientele also leaves something to be desired.  Not that I'm one to throw stones since I stayed there, but I witnessed several times where someone with dogs got into a shouting/swearing match with someone over excessive barking.  Also \\\"pets\\\" doesn't apparently mean cutesie Paris Hilton puppies oh no - many times there were Rottweilers or pitbulls just walking around NO LEASH.  I have a young son and didn't like that at all.\\n\\nAs for the staff they seemed nice enough but I noticed the longer I stayed the less often my room was cleaned.  At the end I got maid service ONE time in the last two weeks I was there.  Also they got rid of the manager during my stay and he had been pretty responsive to any issues I raised.  \\n\\nLet's close on a positive note because the cost for this place is pretty low and you DO get free but slow internet, a smattering of cable channels, and a free breakfast featuring waffles, hard boiled eggs, and coffee/juice.  \\n\\nI'd consider 3 stars for this place if they fixed the issues they can control such as the building issues above and better enforcement of pet policies.  It won't ever be confused for some 5 star hotel and I guess no one expects that, but a lot of what they claimed to offer fell short.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: There are a few things that I have noticed about Portland's over the years. The first is that people who live in the Roosevelt Square probably can't afford to eat there very often. The second is that its location is a bit strange (no visible parking, the apartment gym on one side, a hippie coffee shop on the other). The last thing I've noticed is that it never seems to be busy. We went on a Friday night last year with a group of 11 or 12 and were seated within 15 minutes. Sure, they suffer because of the lightrail but I really just think it is a poor location.\\n\\nCentral Ave doesn't link to the freeway. Portland's is practically on top of the deck park tunnel which means anyone going to or getting off the freeway is going to miss it. There is a large gap between the north and south-bound sides of Central that also prevents North-bound drivers from seeing it. They are more likely to notice the Best Western (and its humble diner) than they are to spot Portland's. Apart from the Channel 12 news people who I see there on numerous occasions, my friends who live in Roosevelt Square never eat there. Sure this place will be buzzing when the lightrail stop directly across the street opens up, but until then, it is just sad.\\n\\nInside however, you will find a very elegant decor with plenty of that \\\"mood lighting\\\" that expensive restaurants use to mask the prices as well as the small portions of food you are receiving. The bar is very nice and well stocked with some of the best bar tenders this side of Mill Ave. The menu, with things like ostrich and a lasagna dish fail to make the grade. Everything is flavorless or over-complicated with drizzles and twigs/trees/lettuce/parsley. You'd probably enjoy this place for a date but not as a regular dine-out destination.\\n\\nIt is worth a stop. Walk by on a First Fridays and check out the menu. If you don't see anything that appeals to you, you're not alone, but sit down at the bar and grab a glass of wine and enjoy the mood lighting.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: I have been on Yelp for over a year and am always the person to read everyone else's reviews, but never leave my own.  Well, Roma Garden has changed that!!  I want THE WHOLE WORLD to know how amazing their food, service and restaurant is.  My husband and I went there to celebrate date night as well as my 30th birthday.  We were lucky enough to have Jenn as our waitress and she was AMAZING!!  Never once did we feel rushed or pressured and she was always there to explain our options and answer all of our questions . \\n\\nWe took our time and just enjoyed the surroundings.  We started our meal with the stuffed clams which were delicious.  And the Marsala wine sauce on top was like a heavenly gravy.  The complimentary bread and herb butter was the perfect accompaniment to my moscato.  Pedro (the magnifico) was always there to fill our waters, bring more bread and was so helpful without us having to ask for a single thing.  \\n\\nNow on to our meals....I ordered the seafood pasta (which wasn't even on the menu but they made it for me!).  It was a full lobster tail, calamari, mussels, clams, prawns (giant) over a bed of fettuccine and pink/vodka sauce!!! It was heavenly!!!  \\n\\nMy husband ordered one of the evening's specials...the seafood risotto which had all of the same seafood as my pasta but it was over a bed of risotto with a homemade marinara sauce!  Needless to say....it was the best meal we have ever had!!  Not only was the food amazing, but the service was the best we have ever had.  \\n\\nAnd to top it all off, the prices were more than reasonable.  We have been to five start restaurants, and this food was hands down ten times better.  We will be coming back here for EVERY date night and will bring as many people as possible with us!!  Thank you Roma Garden, Jenn and Pedro (the magnifico) for making my 30th birthday over the top special!!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I'm not sure how I was so mistaken about how great a restaurant was, when the premise is you boil the main course of meat to eat it. Mmmmm, delicious boiled meat has been said by no one, ever. \\n\\nWe used to love the Melting Pot in NC before moving here. Going to this restaurant was an event and you knew you would be dropping some serious $$$ to eat there.  When I saw the Living Social deal for $45 for $75 it seemed like a no brainer and a fun evening out. Boy was I wrong. \\n\\nTo me, $45 for $75 says they are going to give me a $75 credit for the tab of whatever I order. For a tab that can be close to $200, this seemed like a deal so I bought it. I was surprised when we arrived and was given a \\\"Prefixed Living Social\\\" menu instead of a credit on whatever we would like. This, I also noticed, came with smaller portion sizes than what the regular menu came with. So they limit what I can order, but expect me to tip on whatever the full amount would have been without a credit?  We upgraded some of our choices knowing it would be more expensive, but it still didn't make for an enjoyable evening.\\n\\nThe locations in NC are set up so no booth is right across from another booth, they are kind of staggered for privacy, here felt like we were eating at TGI Fridays. The couple that was set directly across from us had requested a more private table that could not be accommodated and they made a scene. Uncomfortable, to say the least and not the date night I had in mind.\\n\\nYou better be a fan of garlic to eat here, because aside from the dessert, it's in every choice of every course and something about a plate of raw meat and seafood being set down in front of you, with instructions of how long to let it \\\"cook\\\" as in- if it walks boil two minutes, if it swims boil a minute and  1/2, is less than appetizing. \\n\\nOur total bill came to $180 (before the $75 credit or tip) and we left disappointed, vowing to never return. Our Living Social Deal also listed we would be given a complimentary champagne toast, which we were...\nSo I would like to give it",

The walls were thin as I could hear conversations in the next room as well (not just their TV).  \\n\\nThe breakfast was fine - included in the cost of the room - but the toaster did not work very well at all (so you ended up with hot bread instead of toasted) and the juices were like water with flavoring.  Also the scrambled eggs were like rubber and from powder or egg beaters or something - very watery.  The coffee - also not very good.  Thank goodness there was a Starbucks across the street.\\n\\nThe A/C units were the old-style and made insane noises when cutting on and off all night - not very helpful when trying to sleep.

Also when I specifically ordered chx wings for my kids \\\"these are for my kids\\\" he could've told me that mild is still a little spicy. My spicy wings were great.

        "Review: What awful customer service!!! I have never seen such a poor and untrained host/hostess as I witnessed today. The absolute worst. The blue haired host should be fired immediately! Letting people take up tables for 3 hours is an absolute joke. It's basic restaurant customer service 101....turn the tables as quickly as possible. If people are lingering ask them to head to the bar. Even offer to buy them a drink! But never have people waiting over 2 1/2 hours for a table for pub food....EVER! We are regular patrons but today was pathetic. The host was clueless and the bar was understaffed, all on a Sunday morning to say the least. What a poor excuse to say you can't ask people to give up their table....are you kidding!! They are basically just sitting there for free and you are losing revenue all because a host and wait staff don't understand how a restaurant should operate. We all love to come and watch the games on Saturday and Sunday mornings but it should be stated when seated that there is a 90 minute time limit per table and it should be ENFORCED. People will understand. Let them finish watching the matches at the bar and TURN THE TABLE! PERIOD! Again the blue haired host needs to be fired for his lack of ability and lack of customer service skills! This may be the last time we ever go to Piper's....how sad!!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

We were there on a Pens Playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms.  Our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that.  Our orders were somewhat mixed up.  The potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing.  I tasted a slice of pizza, which is definitely the best thing they offer.  The crust was delicious and homemade.

        "I don't usually write reviews of places at all, but after using Yelp to pick this place as a place to meet up prior to a Diamondbacks game based on the largely positive reviews, I had to come back and let people know not to believe the hype on here.\\n\\nI am a lover of food and rarely find something that is just plain inedible, but that's what happened with every course of my meal at Coach & Willies. We started out with appetizers including meatballs, Italian nachos, and a wedge salad for the table. The meatballs were actually pretty good and my girlfriend also enjoyed her wedge salad. However, the Italian nachos were just plain disgusting. They reminded me of those cheap $1.50 Totino's pizzas that you can get in the freezer aisle at the grocery. The \\\"chips\\\" were mushy on the outside and hard as a brick on the inside; the toppings were clearly cheap and tasted awful. For my meal, I ordered the bourbon steak flat bread wrap. It was absolutely inedible. I was very hungry and was only able to force down two bites of the sandwich before calling it quits -- something that is unheard of for me. \\n\\nAltogether, I hope no one else makes the mistake of going to this place and expecting the good food that people here have written about. The menu is rather large and maybe that's why they are having a hard time keeping the food at a high quality. If you go here before a game, I'd recommend sticking to the beers and then getting a hot dog at the field. My rating for this place is",

        "When my boyfriend and I were down with the flu, we ordered some food here through Eat24. I got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone. When I unpacked the food and tried a sip of my soup, I found that it was cold and had bubbles in it, as if there was soap in it. I couldn't really taste anything, but my boyfriend said it smelled like dishwater. To say the least, I was disappointed in my soup. When my boyfriend cut into his calzone, he said the cheese was barely melted. We thought it was undercooked and touched the outside. It was cold, as if it was sitting out in the open for a long time. He tried to take a bite, but the dough was barely even cooked and the contents of the seafood calzone was cold and tasted sour.\\nThis was our first time ordering from here and it was such a sad experience to have, since our food was inedible. I heard this place was good and had great calzones and tasty soup, but what we received was the complete opposite from the praise I've heard about this place. My rating for this place is",

It was a Saturday night and the outside patio was packed, but it turns out that was a private party, the inside was much more free.  \\n\\nThe Hostess greeted us with a welcome and asked if we had a reservation.  I asked \\\"Do we need one?\\\"  She replied we did not a lead us to a table in the corner near the front window.

I guess they were not planning on being busy that night...?\\n\\nHere's where the poor part of the evening began, with our waitress.  She came to the table without introduction and asked if we wanted drinks.  We did not so she quickly departed allowing us time to peruse the menu.  When she returned, her first words were, \\\"Have you decided?\\\"  Biting my tongue for fear of the endless comebacks I could have used, I asked about specials.  She jumped into recall-mode and tried to think about what was being offered, all without pricing or recommendations. \\n\\nOne of the items was interesting but not enough to make me change my mind on what I was intending on having.  I chose the Lasagna which comes with a soup or salad.  I chose the salad.  There must only be one choice as she did not ask me about my preferences so I have to assume its the only option.  Mom chose the Italian Wedding Soup which on the menu was listed as a single item but the waitress then asked \\\"Large or Small?\\\"  Wouldn't \\\"Cup\\\" or \\\"Bowl\\\" be more appropriate?\\n\\nThe other thing that chapped my ass about this waitress was the fact that we were there well before 6pm and there are Early Bird Dinner specials offered from 3-6 which she never suggested and looked to be a great value...about 6 separate items all for $9.95 each all of them something would like, too!\\n\\nA basket of bread was brought out along with some Whipped Garlic & Herb Butter. ...\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

You brought me in with the price, you kept me with the taste. I love a good chicken teriyaki bowl and Aloha has it.

The portabello wrappini (hold the cheese, please) and the salad bar with their black currant tea are the keys to the good life for lunch and a mid-afternoon craving for a friggin' good sandwich.

How can you beat that in Vegas.\\n\\nWe ordered:  (2) Hu Tieu Hoac Mi Ga -Chicken Rice  Noodle - 5.95; (2) Kim Lon Egg Rolls; Pho Tai 5.95; (3) Rare Steak Noodle Soup; Special Combination Tender Beef Noodle Soup - Pho Dac Biet 6.95; 4 Avocado shakes; Soda Chanh Duong - Soda with Fresh Lemon - 2.50.\\n\\nService was good and food came in a jiffy.

After waiting more than 20 minutes for our sandwiches (in the end these are still just sandwiches), they came out cold - and I'm not just talking about the meat, lettuce, tomatoes - everything was cold including the fries.

I can't count on my fingers and toes how many police involved stories I know about concerning the owners harassing patrons and the treatment of the employees. Look for a pathetic looking blonde-haired witch drunk at the bar, and know that she is in charge of the operation. \\nBy the way, please tip your bartender/server as they are illegally not getting paid to work.

I'm always taken aback by hotel rooms that aren't decorated with those tacky shades of bright green, coral and tan.  This had a pleasant ivory/gold and navy blue color scheme.  The bed was very comfortable.  Everything seemed very clean.  The staff was friendly upon check-in/check-out.  The only problem was that the walls were incredibly thin and we could hear everything that was being screamed down the hallways by drunks at 3 a.m.  \\n\\n2) My friend's wedding reception that was held here was lovely.  A member of the waitstaff noticed that a friend of mine had spilled her water all over the table and mopped it up before we could even ask for a towel.  Most of the service was great like that, except for a mixup with some of the entrees--but that was corrected immediately upon our request.\nSo I would like to give it",

They are often packed at dinnertime.\\n\\nAt first, I had a hard time finding something I liked--I didn't like the pizza, and I didn't like the fact that the salad was full of iceberg lettuce. I finally found my favorite--their alfredo pasta primavera with chicken. My hubby and son like the pizzas, and my friend loves the meatball subs. I haven't tried a calzone here, but I hear they are good. The bread that comes with the pasta is wonderful, as long as it's not cooked too long. \\n\\nWe mostly get great and friendly service here, and they have coupons in various places. Found one in a Mexican free newspaper that my hubby got. Found others on the Chandler town calendar you can get at the library or parks and rec. \\n\\nOther good things--our 1yr old likes tomatoes, and they let us order just tomatoes for him. We've never been charged extra for a bowl of cut-up tomatoes for him.  AND the cookie sundae? mmmmm...fantastic. Baked chocolate-chip cookie w/ vanilla ice cream and whipped cream and chocolate sauce on top, to share.\\n\\nAlso, there are TVs with sports on scattered throughout, as well as at the bar area (where you can also sit and eat).\\n\\nSomething to improve on: often they forget to ask if we need a high-chair or booster seat; then we have to ask and I feel like I'm imposing because they are always so swamped.

        "Review: In the working class areas of Phoenix, one can spy a small Mexican eatery every hundred yards. A tortillera here, a taqueria there...blindfold me and send me to Maryvale, my stomach will lead my feet to menudo in mere minutes. \\n\\nBut here on 67th & Bell, they don't seem too keen on ubiquitous Latin fare. This is middle class, soccer mom territory, and for the most part the locals seem satisfied sustaining themselves on Chipotle. But what if they dare venture to another part of town? Certainly, their curiosity must make them hungry for something slightly more authentic.\\n\\nWell with Caramba's in town, they must not feel like they have to. This place is a parody of every obscure \\\"bertos\\\" I've stumbled into on an empty stomach. The music is all in Spanish, and there's some good ol' futbol on TV. The cashier was eager to explain away any menu item, as if the usual clientele couldn't tell their chilaquiles from an enchilada. Jajaja.  \\n\\nAnyways, I ordered the fundido, because I figured their specialty was more...Tex Mex. It wasn't too appealing, essentially a fried burrito topped with generous amounts of an interesting cream cheese sauce. I washed it down with a fountain drink, but then I spied a sign...they charge a quarter for refills. That's not much at all, but not even Taco Bell does that--why should they? \\n\\nOut of defiance, I tossed my cup and just ordered a margarita. $3.25 seemed like a steal, I was excited to have one with my breakfast. I didn't mind it coming out of a fountain, but it was incredibly strong! Stronger than any margarita I've had in a restaurant. But, it was still worth it.\\n\\nApparently, their specialty is the cheese crisp, the more complex of them branded \\\"Mexican pizza\\\". I saw some being ordered, and I wasn't the slightest bit impressed, especially with tortillas that tasted like they came from the Fry's next door.\\n\\nPersonally, I don't think Carambas deserves the popularity it has. The food is middle-of-the-road, and their prices the same amount as a dozen places you could eat...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Great Clips is what it is....every one who steps into a GC location needs to come in with certain.......EXPECTATIONS, I guess is the word. Let me explain further...\\n\\n~What To Do~\\nGet your hair cut, colored, primped, primed for greatness\\n\\n~The Good~\\nThe stylists at each location are pretty even across the board as far as expertise goes. You can go to each location you want and get pretty much the exact hair cut. I still am amazed that no other hair place keeps your hair records like GC does. Why not, other stores?! That makes it so much easier on me, not having to remember my numbers and styles, etc. Also, as always, the discounts they have seasonally on cuts are nice on my wallets, as are the the general prices. Finally, for not having to set up appointments, its pretty fast eating for a cut.. I never have had to wait too long to get my hair cut which is a plus.\\n\\n~The Bad~\\nIs primarily quality of the hair cut. The expertise seriously lacks beyond basic comprehension for a general haircut. I was paying a lot more for much nicer haircuts, but its not a big deal to me since I just need my hair to look decent. But seriously, everyone knows this place is for all the new hair cutters to get their feet wet in the business. If you expect anything more than a generic haircut, be forewarned. If you want a specific style, be wary, for it might not come out how you'd like it. I still think most people whom go here are already aware of most of this. Also, its hit or miss as far as the personality you work with. Some of the stylists are visibly in another dimension at times, they seem like they would rather be a garbage picker than working their....then there are the ones whom go the extra mile. Unfortunately the ones that do just that are the ones whom move up to a better job, oh well..\\n\\n~The Down Low ~\\nThis specific location is closest to me and allows me to go get my haircut for a relatively cheap rate. If I get a better job (crosses fingers) then I would really prefer going somewhere else...But until then,...\nSo I would like to give it",

Your traditional mom & pop shop diner experience.

The eggs were cooked to order, I like my eggs over medium and they were just right! No runny white stuff! The meat, tender and flavorful. Some beans and two tortillas finished it off.\\n\\nI'll definitely be returning to Brunchies and trying more from their huge menu and to try some of the amazing cakes I was spying under those glass covers ;-)\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nWith the end of the year coming and the realization that it'd been about 2 years since I'd been to the optometrist I made an appointment for an exam just in case.  I of course searched Yelp to see which place looked the best and Central Phoenix Eye Care was in the top ranks so I made my appointment with them.  When I called she let me know that all of the patient paperwork was available online to fill out and print to bring with you and save time, something I'm always a big fan of.\\n\\nWhen I arrived the ladies at the front were very friendly and gave me one more form to fill out that wasn't available online so it wasn't something I'd missed, but it was short and didn't take long to fill out.  After a little bit someone came out and took me back to do the pre-exam tests with all the fun eye machines that look like arcade games.  After that it was into the exam room to wait for the doctor.  All the tests looked good and then it was onto the fun part, trying on different colors of colored contacts!\\n\\nThey were really patient and helpful with me, I tried a ton of different colors and I never felt rushed or like he was trying to get rid of me.  In fact he was suggesting more for me to try!  At the end of the appointment when I went to check out I was a bit taken aback by the total, I knew that I had a $15 copay so that's what I was expecting to pay but she quoted me $65.  Apparently there's a $50 fee for the exam for contact lenses, not a huge deal but I still wish they would have told me that ahead of time when they'd asked if I was interested in contacts or not.  Still everyone was friendly and I had a good experience.\n\nReview rating:",

The only helpful worker was the only male there and he didn't know too much about the stores products \\nI will go out of my way to never shop here again \\n... And this is coming from someone who has worked in customer service so I get what a bad day is like but there was absolutely no feasible excuse for acting like that\nSo I would like to give it",

I walked into the small front room and thought surely I was in the wrong place. Then they rolled the doors back to this HUGE dance hall sized room in the back . It seems there are bands and dancing in here from time to time? Interesting.\\n\\nService was good, but most importantly the food was excellent. I tried lots of things I had never had before - tongue (seriously amazing, like short rib and nothing like the tongue tacos I've had since!), and the pork skin also rocked. It was chewy and fatty and wonderful. MMMM\\n\\nDefinitely a place to check out if off the wall meats and interesting cuisine are your thing !\n\nReview rating:",

I've tried to go out of my way to support it because I like the diverse selection and small hardware store vibe, but it's hard to keep wanting to support it. The last visit I made I was looking for a simple eye bolt, and couldn't get a staff member to help, a couple of the guys were bullshitting around in the nuts and bolts instead of working. Finally, I got one of the other folks to help me find the exact bolt. When I got to the register, the customer in front of me got prices mixed up on some chain, and an angry little man ran up to the counter and began arguing with the customer, saying the prices were labeled wrong but he (the customer) should have known and just generally being an ass to him. I believe this man was the manager. I was damn near about to walk out but the bolt was under $2 so I figured I might as well get it and go. \\n\\nFor the most part, the staff is friendly and tries really hard to help the customer, but the past few visits have made it hard to stay going here. I'll take my business to another ace for the time being.\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nGino's Italian Deli on Century Avenue is my go-to option for any time I don't feel like cooking or if I'm in the mood for an excellent sandwich.  In college I worked at a similarly-themed restaurant/deli so my expectations weren't too high when after college I moved out to Middleton.  I knew of the place and had driven by it multiple times but had never stopped until a fortunate visit from my father.  After helping me move a couch, my father took a look at my spartan apartment and said, \\\"Well at least you're pretty close to the Middleton Gino's.\\\"  Upon learning that I hadn't ever been to either the deli locations or the State Street restaurant he insisted on getting subs that night.  Even four years later I can still remember how satisfying it was.  \\n\\nOver the years I've moved several times but I've never strayed too far from Gino's.  I enjoy the hot subs to such an extent that I haven't managed to work my way through the menu yet, but here are a few of my favorites.  My standard order is the Italian beef with giardinera peppers, provelone and a dip.  I couple this with a quarter pound of the Cajun chicken salad and I'm set.  I've gotten into a few disputes over the authenticity of the #12 Italian beef compared to the Chicago standards, but I believe you like what you were introduced to and for me this is the best it gets.  The #11 meatball sub is another favorite, so much so that I usually have a hard time deciding when I get up to the counter.  The cold subs on the menu are not to be overlooked either, although I find myself doing this all the time.  My personal favorite is the #14 artichoke & turkey.  The sweet and spicy honey mustard on this is perfect with the artichoke hearts and cucumbers, and this sandwich keeps well in the refrigerator so I like to take this in for lunch.  The #7 roast beef is great in it's simplicity - just thinly sliced beef with lettuce and horseradish sauce.  I like to pick up Gino's before heading over the Capital Bier Garten to meet up with friends and family, and the #7...\n\nReview rating:",

        "I consider Sonoma Cellar a \\\"bargain\\\" because its food can stand up to great steakhouses, but the prices don't.  I'm not saying it's the equivalent of Cut or Carnevino, because it's not, but Sonoma is excellent.\\n\\nTo start, we usually get the crabcakes and tomato soup.  With the soup, you get a nice little grilled cheese sandwich that I would be fine ordering for a meal at other places.  The crabcakes are large and full of crab meat, not as much filler as you see elsewhere.  Shrimp cocktail is also a winner, large and the sauce has good horseradish flavor.\\n\\nThe steaks are excellent, and we've not had an issue with cooking temperature.  We usually get a steamed lobster, which is standard.  It's cooked well and served with drawn butter.  No complaints here, but it's also not anywhere near the best lobster we've had.\\n\\nOnce, we took friends from Dallas, and one of them ordered the pork T-bone.  This was fantastic, but I won't ever be able to not order the ribeye.\\n\\nLast time we dined here, we had a group of 6.  The server gave us tasters of bottles of wine before we ordered them.  We ended up ordering quite a bit of wine, so clearly the strategy worked, but it was a nice touch.  The service is always fantastic.  It's an excellent experience and we will definitely be back.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Finally made it back to My Mother's here, this time joined by Jackie C. & Mike C.\\n\\nThe two dining rooms here are cozy and comfortable, and the menu plan isn't great but it's passable.  We all three ordered burgers this time, mine with potato salad and both of theirs came with fries.  All the food was ok but the service was very slow, for one thing.  We arrived to a nearly empty restaurant just a little while after opening time (way before noon), yet were warned by our server that our burgers would take about 20 minutes, and they did take at least that long.  (She brought us out some warm bread to hold us over, but that wasn't what we wanted to eat, especially along with hamburgers!)\\n\\nWhen the burgers finally arrived, two of them weren't made as ordered and the (different) staffer that served us didn't have any idea which one was to go to whom either.  Service after that wasn't good either.  I had to flag down someone to ask for some more napkins and also later for our checks (which also were wrong) when it was time to go.\\n\\nLunch pricing generally over $10 if you get either a beverage or their Salad Bar (only one trip allowed, with a tiny saucer).\\n\\nI suspect this will be my last visit to see Mother.     :-| My rating for this place is",

Lighting is an the dark side in this room but I'm okay with that. Looks like they put goop, like canned liquidy fruit junk all over their offerings of pancakes, waffles, crepes and blintzes. Most people go for that sweet stuff but I'm not a fan. I'd prefer freshly made.   Coffee is borderline.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "This was our second visit to Smoky's last night, after a long period in between. The decor had been updated which is nice, however, that's about the only positive thing I have to report.\\n\\nWhen we got to the restaurant we were told there was a 15 Minute wait (sat night). So, we went to the bar. It was not busy..after 45 min upon approaching the hostess she said she had told us to just come back over when we were ready....odd that I had to give her my name for her list...she did not say anything like this to us. She stated she was \\\"sorry for the communication error\\\" and did nothing.\\n\\nThe best thing about the meal was the salad (Roquefort dressing) and the modified cottage cheese. My steak was ordered medium rare and one side was so charred it was well done. Could have sent it back as others have stated but after an hour and 45 min, we had it. The meat was not seasoned and was bland. My husband has prepared steak MUCH better than this.\\n\\nIf we wouldn't have had a gift certificate we would have left with the hostess oversight. We won't ever be back again and wouldn't recommend dining here to anyone. Too many other choices in Madison that are stellar compared to the service and quality of food we received.

        "I did not get a sandwich from here. I ordered the spicy ramen noodles since it was a chilly, rainy day. I was genuinely shocked on how amazing it was! Not that I didn't think it would be good, but it was seriously some of the best stuff I've ever had. I now crave it at least once a week! \\n\\nNot only did the amazing soup earn them the 5 stars. The service was awesome. I only ate about half a bowl of soup and asked for a to-go container. The lady came out and separated my noodles from the broth and put them in different containers. She also explained to me how to reheat it properly so it doesn't ruin the flavor. She then taped them tightly shut so it didn't leak in my car.\\n\\nFYI this is an \\\"order at the counter\\\" type of place. This type of superb service was totally unexpected, but greatly appreciated. I was able to eat the rest of my ramen the next day and it tasted just as fresh and flavorful as when it was first served. This was all thanks to the wonderful service of this sandwich shop.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

What other wimpy pasta's can compete with that? The OG (short for Olive Garden) doesn't hold a spaghetti noodle to this place! \\n\\nI swear you to you I haven't seen the same noodle twice here. They always seem to serve up a dish with some crazy looking pasta that they say the name of and I can never remember. But obviously the best thing about it is the sauce! Oh, the sauce! Meat sauce, sweet sauce, lemon, butter, the list goes on and on. I'll never forget the first time I fell in the love there. I fell in love with this out of this world pumpkin ravioli. I'll never forgot you pumpkin ravioli, NEVER! (This was all said looking wistfully out the window like in a movie montage). \\n\\nBut don't fear if you need something other than pasta (I don't know why, but let's roll with it). I attended a party there once and we had a a three course meal. First we had a delish caesar salad, which was on the lemony side, just the way I like it! Then we had a choice between meats and a fish and I tried the fillet. It was...to. Die. For! I was very pleasantly surprised that my non-pasta meal was so utterly satisfying. Then came the light and fluffy tiramisu. Now I was officially in heaven! We were also sent home with a goodie bag that included Lidia's Eggplant Pasta Sauce. I tried it a couple days later and it was great! It's a red sweet sauce with a tiny kick to it. I loved that it had eggplant in it because it was something different than your normal meatie balls and sauce combination. \\n\\nAnd lastly, the ambiance is very unique. There's huge windows in the front to gaze out at well, a parking lot. But they're tinted so you have a nice intimate vibe going on. There's also a huge glass Chihuly chandelier hanging in the middle of the restaurant that's gorge! So please, convert over from the OG, you will not be disappointed. And don't worry, they DO give free bread sticks!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

I can tell you that this place can't be beat in the fun for value dept.  I mean where else can you get $4 Absolut and tonics - plus free (oftentimes campy and klassy) entertainment.  The crowd, the singing skills and the singing tastes here run the gamut, and that's part of the appeal.  \\n\\nThe crowd is mostly gay men in their 30s and 40s, but goes older and younger.  Lesbians also hold court here as well.  I mean, who else will do the honors to sing Pat Benatar and Melissa Etheridge?  Many gay men will bring their straight girlfriends, most likely so they will have someone to sing the Grease duet with.  And believe it or not, a handful of straight men will be dragged here.  But not to fear.  The crowd is very friendly and welcoming and the bartenders and owners take care of the people here.\\n\\nAs for what kind of music to expect, some people are completely hammered and singing in public for the very first time, while others are serious and more seasoned - some with classical training via the Phoenix Men's Choir.    And a few of these guys would make American Idol drool with desire. \\n\\nThe song list is large and respectable (but think George and Dragon has a better list - see my review...).  The songs run the spectrum from Liza Minelli Cabaret, to Tim McGraw, to hip-hop rap, to 80s alt rock, to U2, AC/DC, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, and Frank Sinatra.\\n\\nThis place is totally small and divey -and a bit weathered looking when you speed past it on 7th St.  Useless trivia alert.

        "After living in New York for 4 years, Italian food in Phoenix definitely pales in comparison. However, the food here was not what I had an issue with, the service was lack luster/borderline horrible. I call it my 3 hour tour, which ended instead of crashing into a foreign island, sipping a free shot of sambuca. My reservation was for 7 and I was seated almost immediately. I ordered my drink and waited a good 15 minutes before it arrived. Then I waited a close to 20 minutes before the next order of drinks arrived. This continued. Listen, I get that you are busy and it is Friday, I get it. But please have someone run drinks to their tables, a continuous flow of alcohol always keeps patrons happy, especially when the food is taking a long time. The waitress was slammed, had too many tables and VERY forgetful. If you want to spend 250 dollars, have great food and not great drinks or service, go here. Otherwise, I recommend you go to a restaurant that can accommodate you in all regards. That, or go here at a time when you are sure to miss the traffic. \\n\\nMy comments on the food are as follows: \\n-Antipasto for 2- Love, love, love! The plate is enough for 4, big portions and big flavors. \\n-Gnocchi marinara-Love it! Little fluffy clouds of potato wonder. Highly recommended.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

The print at the bottom said you could ask for other menus yet when we asked this server did not want to give us another menu. After complaining to the manager, we were given another server who was very nice. Out of the five people in our party, four of us enjoyed our food. One ordered grilled veggies, and was given veggies steamed to the point of being mushy. Having to pay extra for fried rice is ridiculous also.

        "This place is supposed to be super famous for their pies, even appearing on national television shows and places in Phoenix get the pies imported down. However, I couldn't see why. I've had some great pies and while my banana creme pie was pretty great, it didn't blow my mind or anything. It was banana creme with banana slices topped with a hearty helping of genuine whipped creme. Pretty good. The service was fast, too, though I did order a root beer off the pie menu (supposedly \\\"real\\\" root beer brewed local and from a tap or something) but I'm pretty sure it was just a glass of A&W. No froth or in a beer mug or anything like the description read. \\nFor two slices of pie and two drinks with tip, bill was $18. That's pretty extravagant for the atmosphere (think Bill Johnson's or any other \\\"cowboy\\\" steak house) and what we got. I felt cheated, to be honest.\\nAnyway, it was a \\\"been there, done that\\\" sort of thing. No need for a repeat performance.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "If getting your nails done in a clean environment is important to you, I would suggest steering clear of this place. I went in for a manicure one morning and another lady was waiting for one right after me. The glass bowl filled with water used to soak my nails in was simply dumped out and refilled with water for the next person. I was totally disgusted! There are no sanitizing solutions in sight. The nail utensils used are kept in plastic boxes and not cleaned after each use. I watched the lady wipe my dead skin off and then put them right back in the box. I was totally grossed out. Also, she asked me if I would pay for my manicure before we started, which I thought was a little weird, but not too big of a deal I suppose. And on top of that, it started chipping the next day because she was rushed to get to the next customer and missed the sides of my nails with the second coat.

But upon check in a $30.00 \\\"resort fee\\\" and a $15 buck parking fee not mentioned on my corporate travel portal.  Thus they are sneaky , especially in    mid June.  Rooms are great and the ambiance is fantastic. They just sock it to you for extra $$$$ at every turn. Beware. I will review the restaurant T cooks latter but what I have had so far a great roasted beer salad for $12 bucks was the size of a sampling at a restaurant week somewhere. Rip off.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nI really wanted to love this hotel. A hotel with a water park? Who can beat that. But from the onset it got off to a rocky start.\\n\\nAny place that calls itself \\\"Arizona Grand Resort\\\" has set the bar high. But the curb appeal is something closer to a Motel 6. Unkempt grounds lead up to the main lobby building.\\n\\nI pulled up to the front and explained to the valet that I wished to run inside and check-in. My wife and daughter would remain in the car. The valet demanded my car keys. We went back and forth for about 5 minutes until he finally allowed me to just move it a few feet over.\\n\\nCheck-in went ok but I wasn't advised were my room was (the place is huge!) on the map. Instead I was told to ask one of the valets (great) to show us to our building.\\n\\nSo I go outside, show our room number to another one of the 'happy' valets and he jumps in a golf carts and takes off (I suppose I'm to follow). He flies through parking lots (some are very tight roads along side buildings) until we wind up at our building. It looks like a rear entrance. There are no handicap parking spots to be found anywhere (I'm disabled), lots of monster trucks taking up two spaces), and exposed wires in the ground. I dismiss the 'happy' valet.\\n\\nWe head to our room upstairs through an elevator as cold as a meat locker.\\n\\nWe check on the water park, come to find out it's only open on Saturday and Sunday (11-4), we checked in Friday at 4pm.\\n\\nSaturday morning we line up for the water park at the main gate along with several other families. There are plenty of park staff members on the other side of the gate. 11:00 turns and the gate doesn't open. Eventually one of the staff members says the gate is not the entrance, you have to enter through the gift shop. Seriously? No sign? They couldn't say that once for the previous 20 minutes?\\n\\nSaturday night we called the front desk to get a late checkout. The girl who answered said we would have to call back Sunday morning because only the Sunday manager would know their occupancy. Trust me...\n\nReview rating:",

        "I had a hard time deciding how to rate this not because of indifference on my part, but rather with respect to what to expect. So let's just start with, if you're looking for the full-on Korean experience with dozens of bowls around you and formal, even surly, sullen service, this is not the place. But if you want some excellent food in a relaxed environment, you won't be disappointed.\\n\\nThe name says it all: this is Korean (and Hawaiian and, coming up, Chinese/Korean) with island style. The owner (or the husband of the owner couple) just oozes chill; it's practically relaxing just talking to him. And he'll hang out and chat. Even call you \\\"brah.\\\" The service overall is personal, informal, and pleasant.\\n\\nThis is a tiny place; it's in a strip mall, and you'd be forgiven for not finding it right away. You have to look hard and hope that you're not being pressed by busy Sahara traffic.\\n\\nI was on my own, in town for CES. When seated, he first gave me a bowl of boiled peanuts to nosh on. Then came the banchan trio: kim chi, kaktugi (Korean radish kim chi), and bean sprouts. I'm reasonably familiar with kim chi (I make my own occasionally); this was good, although not particularly sour or complex. The kaktugi was great. He then brought out a separate bowl of this radish-green kim chi. This was absolutely excellent; spicy and sharp with a hint of sweet.\\n\\nI went with the spicy squid; really good. (Not super spicy, but then again, I have a high threshold.)\\n\\nCost: around $15 for everything. Really. In contrast to many Korean places. And I left totally full.\\n\\nApparently they have just installed three high-intensity burners (they had just been inspected and approved that day), and they plan to do Chinese-style food too, like black noodles. They will also hand-make their own noodles.\\n\\nPity I don't live here; it would become a regular place for me. Clearly they have other regulars (one couple came in and the waiter asked if they wanted him to clean their regular table so they could sit there instead of... My rating for this place is",

        "I was in Las Vegas over the past weekend to attend the Mountain West Conference tournament.  I had tickets for t he Thursday game and at the conclusion of that session, I went to the ticket office to purchase tickets for the Saturday championship games.  I was told it was nearing closing time and that if I didn't get them right then, I would have to do it on Saturday.  I obliged and being a San Diego State fan, I was hoping to be close to Section 230.  I was given the tickets in the requested area, albeit in Row T, but at least I was where I wanted to be.  \\n\\nCome gameday, me and 2 of my friends went to get into the arena, but were stopped because the tickets we had were for Friday!  I could not believe that I was issued tickets for the wrong session.  On top of that, one of my friends was able to get into the arena with these same tickets.  I guess it wasn't scanned or something.  I was then directed to go back to the ticket office to get new tickets.  After explaining what had happened, the supervisor took about 15 minutes to get us the seats.  Unfortunately for us, these new seats were in the other side of the arena in the heart of the New Mexico fans.  \\n\\nFinally getting to the seats halfway through the first half, we were able to settle in and watch the game.  Granted, I should have checked before I left the ticket window, but its hard to imagine that this type of mistake can happen because someone wanted to close her window and go home.  Worst part about it is that there isn't another alternative to getting tickets for this event except through the ticket office.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Mostly Miller products on tap, but they also have a few good alternative beers.  I had the fish boil, fish was delicious, moist and flaky.  The salad wasn't bad, an iceberg lettuce base, but it also had broccoli, radish, cabbage and red onions which was nice.  It comes with carrots and onion and red potatoes which were all very good.

Didn't need it here!\\n\\nCelebrated Father's Day a little early with dear hubby. Reservation for 6:00 PM, we were greeted BY NAME by each person who served us. Having never been here before, really didn't know what to expect, but our server was killer polite and helped us understand the steak prep a little better. \\n\\nI had the harvest salad (the best salad I've ever had, no lie, and it was HUGE!) and DH had the caesar.  He said it was very good. We ordered wine, which complimented the meal spectacularly.  We each had the filet with shrimp combo, and DH had the blue cheese crumble topping on his. I think I died and went to steak heaven!  The topping was crunchy, creamy, and just delicious.  Like I said before, no ketchup anywhere on my plate.  I have never tasted a steak so delicious, so tender, so awesomely cooked with awesomeness.  We also had creamed spinach (meh), garlic green beans (these were delish) and a crab cake (again, delish!).\\n\\nAll in all, a terrific dinner.  Well over $200, but a terrific dinner nonetheless.

I checked my credit card today and saw a charge of $156. I called them to inquire on the charge and they said it was because we had a dog. If you look above, you see it is pet friendly with no mention of any charges. This seems like a scam to me. I'll be on the phone with AMEX in the morning. There are a bunch of places around this area. I'd recommend staying in one of the many other places. Plus, there were some guys at the back entrance smoking something which made me feel uncomfortable for my wife. Maybe choose a different area. EDIT: You can see the honesty from this hotel in the comment below as a response. The manager is named \\\"john F\\\" in the title and \\\"ajay patel\\\" in the comment body. Let this be a symptom of your experience at the hotel. I suppose he thought putting the \\\"kennedy\\\" on the end would be going too far.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review: I don't quite know how to rate Chart House. We came here for restaurant week with the promise of a pretty twilight lake view and delicious dinner.\\n\\nWe made reservations. But for some reason it took 15 minutes and 4 hostesses to seat us. We waited for our server Bucky to arrive and then felt a bit rushed to get our orders in. He talked at us like a pirate. All you could see out the window was the bright reflection of the glaring bar lights. So much for a window seat upon the lake.\\n\\nThen the food came. It was delicious! I never realized that a caesar salad could be dressed up to taste this good. And the macadamia nut crusted shrimp was THE best ever. Sooo good! Yum! My date enjoyed his prime rib although it was extra fatty. He also reports that the clam chowder was only average. \\n\\nDessert became a problem. We were informed that they were all out of creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e. This was a major disappointment since this drew us to their restaurant week menu. The server was also unwilling to substitute a different desert item from the regular menu. Bad call. In the end, our server surprised us with the last creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e and it was soggy, mushy, and cold.  Sad face.\\n\\nWe overheard another table complaining to the manager about the slip up with their reservations too. Service makes a difference, folks. We walked away loving the meal but unimpressed with the disjointed experience altogether. For the price, I just won't be trying this spot again.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Only eaten here one time, the food was fine. The service was fine. We were eating at the late lunch, early dinner time so when we arrived there weren't many people there. Then all of a sudden a group of people just started showing up. i couldn't figure out what they were doing. It looked like they were there to watch a game or something, but they took no real interest in a particular event on tv. Guess they were just there to hang out, which that patio space is perfect for. Maybe i was jealous. Their outdoor area is pretty amazing though. It could definitely be a place to hang out or meet up on a nice day. i think the next time i'm here, i'll have to give the pizza a try (i trust the Todd). Just seems hard to justify with Mellow Mushroom so close...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I had to call the store. The operator transferred me to the store manager John (sp?). He was very apologetic about the delay. He said he wasn't sure anyone was scheduled that night to fill orders. He located the items to fill my order. Though I appreciate him willing to do this, I should not have to wait this long or go through a manager just to get my order filled. There should be a disclaimer that orders placed after 3 pm may not get filled until the following day. Will not use this service again. Walmart's site to store shipping may take longer but at least I know I will get my order done, and done in a timely manner.

        "Consumer Fraud part II\\nYes their selection of cold cuts, cheeses etc are quality, therefore expensive items but D&D prices them even higher than the competition.  Where's Zabar when we need them? The espresso is very good, I stopped for an espresso and a croissant and there again was that inviting glass of \\\"fresh\\\" orange juice in front of me. I ask what kind of OJ is it, fresh squeezed or pasteurized?Tropicana IOWs. To me the big deal is that pasteurizing always changes the taste of the juice, even if it's \\\"flash pasteurized\\\"\\n\\nBoth young ladies behind the counter swear high and low that it's fresh squeezed and that's what they are instructed to tell customers.  I buy it, taste it, inform them that it's indeed pasteurized, demand to see the bottle and promise to apologize profusely if I'm wrong. The cashier asks me if I want her to check what the bottle says, I say please yes and she runs off to do it. The girl is back in a NY minute later and tells me \\\"I'm sorry, you were right\\\" \\n\\nThe manager runs over and refunds my breakfast, her dumb excuse is that \\\"they don't have a machine to squeeze oranges\\\". I tell her that's no reason to train the personnel to lie to the customers (no answer) and that they don't need to squeeze oranges any way, Fresh OJ is sold by the gallon anyway. I got lots of sorry, sorry but no assurance that they will stop that shoddy practice. I'm pretty sure that they will keep on marketing it as \\\"fresh\\\" anyway. \\n\\nThis is inexcusable: Harris Teeter retails fresh OJ for $0.08 a fl oz - http://shop.mywebgrocer.com/shop.aspx?strid=E277212 - since D&D charges $2.75 a glass, they could buy it at FULL RETAIL  ($0.48) and still make a 500% markup!!\\nLike I said , no excuse and that's their second location were I caught them doing this.\\n\\nOh and yes their soups are excellent BTW\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nI was introduced to this place by my husband almost 3 years ago. Prior to that, I've heard of it before, but have been. Since then, we come here maybe...every other month (or whenever we get a coupon for this place). \\n\\nEvery single time we've been there we've had great customer service. We've gone when it's been both slow AND busy and have never had any problems. Food is usually at the table within minutes of us ordering. \\n\\nThey give complimentary chips and salsa which I actually don't mind. I know some reviewers say it's bland, but I usually doctor up the beans and just add some hot sauce to the salsa and my hubby and I are fine with that. I'm assuming that have to keep the level of spiciness and a moderate level to cater to the masses. I've always loved the chips and salsa so no complaint there. \\n\\nHubby usually gets steak fajitas and I get my carnitas plate. Almost always I scan the menu wanting to try something new, but I LLLLLOOOOVVVVE carnitas and with the exception of one time, I've never been disappointed. The one time I was disappointed was because I felt it hadn't been seasoned enough and needed just a tad bit more simmering/slow-cooking/whatever you call it. That was about a year ago, and I've had it twice since then and I'm completely happy with it. Hubby LOVES his fajitas. Let me tell you...once again, have never been disappointed. The steak has always been seasoned well and never overpowering. \\n\\nIn my opinion, the portions are HUGE! We always have to take leftovers home. We even ask for extra tortillas for take home and they always oblige!! \\n\\nAnd yes, I've had all kinds of Mexican food and although this may not be super authentic, the food's great and I'd recommend it any day!!!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nIf I can give this shity experience a BIG FAT ZERO, I would. I don't see why people drive hours and hours away from their homes to go sit in dirty ass water. The experience was super extremely  terrible for me. I got so burnt after plastering on so much sun tan lotion. Then  I hit a rock in the middle of the dirty filthy water and almost drowned from the current that kept pushing me and your not sure if it's shallow and it's really 12ft deep. Luckily I know how to swim and the few people who actually helped me thank god. I honestly don't know how people can mix alchol, sun and a crazy ass river. Then the tube gets crazy hot from sitting in the sun and you burn the hell out of your arms on the plastic. Then when your getting near the little currents it gets mega shallow then your ass just rubs on a bunch of rocks and your back and ass get bumped and scratched. How could people seriously enjoy that. Then there is no supervision from anyone from SALT RIVER TUBING AND RECREATION when people do drowned who don't know how to swim. This is seriously a dangerous experience. And the horses who run wildly free and take craps in the water. SO GROSS. Then when exiting it was so hard it says #4 to exit but its so hard cause its near a current where it just keeps dragging you and pushing you in and it's very shallow so when you do jump off your legs get hurt and scratched. This was seriously was a waste of money and scary experience for me. I FREAKIN ALMOST DIED HERE. Is this place even legit cause you can only pay cash of $15.00? No Taxes? Does the state really even know about this place? I would never come back here again.\n\nStars:",

I've been coming here for 3 years and never had any issues here besides the occasional person asking for money in the parking lot. Being the sucker that I am, I usually give it to them. \\n\\nToday was different. As I waddled my pregnant self towards the cashier with my antsy 16 month old in tow, I noticed the cashier giving me a death stare. Whatever, I shrugged it off. We all have bad days. Then, as I started to pay, she said to the little girl with her mom behind me, \\\"Oh good you only have a few items because this is supposed to be an express lane.\\\" With another death stare aimed in my direction. As I looked up, I noticed the 20 items or less sign. I apologized and was only met with more attitude. The little girl behind me asked if she did something wrong and the cashier said \\\"Oh no honey YOU did nothing wrong.\\\" \\n\\nI went home and counted my items. There were 22.\\n\\nIt was an honest mistake but the way the cashier handled the situation was totally out of line.

        "Review: The first \\\"people love us on yelp\\\" sticker.... \\nafter waking up to no coffee (which for the plus one and I is a huge FAIL) I typed in best brunch Scottsdale and fell upon a review that said essentially a lot of really great things but \\\"strong coffee\\\" was what I saw staring at me... \\n\\nSOLD! \\n\\nThis place is super cute. Country Modern feel.... folks are friendly and it feels like you are in the country...but everything from the lighting to the black chairs is mod... LOVE IT. They are kid friendly, couples who want to snuggle friendly, and there is an outside/counter/table option.\\n\\nThere is a sign near the kitchen that says \\\"gratitude, compliments and applause are always welcome\\\" \\n\\nDragonfly Cafe you have all three from me: \\n1. The service is stellar. The gals working the front are all smiles and ensure your coffee is filled and any questions you have are answered. \\n2. The coffee (which comes in super cute white mugs) is strong and after a few minutes I felt somewhat more coherent...enough to order \\n3. My grilled balsamic veggie omelet egg white only with fresh fruit was delicious. The balsamic was not overpowering at all and the feta on top was a great accompaniment. The boyfriend got the french toast and was happy. (btw: they have tons of different kinds of french toast...bananas foster is one I was eyeing but decided to be a tad healthier)\\n4. Carmel Cinnamon Pecan Bun...however you want to rearrange those words the answer is the same... it is like heaven on earth. They are hot... the carmel is buttery and not too sweet... the pecans are like finding treasures amidst a super soft bun. (This pretty much cancels my attempt to be healthy with my breakfast... but to my credit I only ate a quarter..so far today)\\n\\nYes.... like other yelpers have mentioned... they do have Ovaltine. \\n\\nDragonfly Cafe have my gratitude, compliments and applause.. a definite place to eat breffix :-)\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

A very hard thing to get over, regardless of Service or Taste.\\n\\nService:  Excellent, and I wonder if they're happy because they expect tips, above and beyond what you're paying for the food.  20% of a normal $5 is ok, but 20% of $75 is probably why they're smiling.  *** Please correct your prices so families can enjoy your family restaurant ***.\\n\\nTaste:  Excellent.  I appreciate your taking lunchmeat and putting it onto my sandwich.  I just have trouble giving you 10 times the price of the lunchmeat.\\n\\nI'd seen the Man vs. Food episode, so I was excited to eat their food.  I was just stunned to silence by the horribly high prices.  I just couldn't believe the cashier would ask for that much money with a smile on her face.

After reviewing the website multiple times to choose the right vehicle and after 2 back to back web-chats with link to reservations this company refuses to honor their online prices even after I verified the prices in the chats. But that is not the horrible experience, its the way their rep handled the call and the glaring proof that they did not want to recognize. Rebecca went so far as to imply that I could not read the website properly where the heading clearly states 8 passenger, then she hung up on me. I will gladly take my business to another company that understands the meaning of customer service. If they did not want to honor their stated and printed prices then that is what should have been done and stated clearly. Rebecca chose to complain about having to look online to verify then complain more to find web chats that I had emailed to me to verify the price and rudely handle what Rebecca saw as a problem because I took up 18 minutes of her time because she had me on hold then proceed to hang up on me.\\n\\nReservation Reps are the first line and the face of the company. And this companies specifically Rebecca is rude and disrespectful.\\n\\nUse another Limo company. Thank goodness I found out before I left how they handle and treat their customers.\n\nStars:",

        "Pupusas?? As a hardcore Mexican food enthusiast I was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced.  I am proud to say that I am a HUGE fan of pupusas now.  \\n\\nSalvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice Sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food.  It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa.\\n\\nThe restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time I'll just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.)\\n\\nThe only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  I'd love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a \\\"Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!\\\"\\n\\nOn a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.  I'd love to try the Ceviche, as it's on the Best of Phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing. My rating for this place is",

        "When my car started making scary, loud, noises, I panicked and took it to the nearest reputable mechanic (Virginia Auto).  I had heard they were a bit more expensive than other places, but my brother had just had a really great customer service experience there, so I decided to chance it.  After explaining to the very nice mechanic working the front desk that I really did not have any money to spare, I left my car in their hands and crossed my fingers.  A few hours later, I had a written estimate in hand:  $1,600+.  I was hugely disappointed (who happens to have a spare $1,600 lying around?) so I forwarded the quote to some knowledgeable friends who told me that I should definitely get a second opinion.  Once all was said and done, I managed to work out a solution to my auto troubles for $700 from a different mechanic. \\n\\nYes, Virginia Auto does good work.  Yes, they offer GREAT customer service.  NO, it's NOT worth paying DOUBLE for.  \\n\\n\\nP.S. Do yourself a favor and check out Inman & Sons instead. :) My rating for this place is",

        "Ever get that feeling when you're hungry that you could eat just about anything, but nothing sounds all that appealing? I was having a case of that a couple weekends back, so I just had to call up my friends and tell them we're trying out a new place. Just like everyone on the planet (outside of those nutso vegan types), I've had my fair share of fried chicken. However, I had heard of Lo-Lo's a couple times, and I felt I was doing myself and my friends a disservice by not having tried it out already.\\n\\nI was absolutely right. Admittedly, the wait to get inside was pretty long, but this seems to be the norm at the best places in town. Most likely, people are tired of hanging around Applebee's waiting for an overdone steak.\\n\\nUpon finally walking inside, I was bestowed with an image that will be burned into my mind until the dirt nap: Shaquille O' Neal was sitting at a small table and looking at his phone with a very generous meal laid out before him. He had driven to the restaurant in his Ferrari (an F360, I believe). If this place is good enough for Shaq, it's good enough for me. I mean, who am I? Shaq could step on me and I'd be in Traction.\\n\\nAnyway -- all Shaqs aside -- the Lo-Lo meal is perfect. Good-sized portion, but not overdoing it. Three pieces of chicken and two big waffles for nine dollars. Of course, make sure to have a little extra for a drink. Sides are available as well, but the chicken and waffles alone filled me up right. Some of the best fried chicken I've had in a long time (at least since last time I went to Mrs. White's), and certainly the best waffles. What else can I say? I'm a believer.\\n\\nWhile you may not have the same experience I did (I doubt Shaq lives in the restaurant), you will love this place if you even moderately enjoy soul food. It's got a charm all its own and some of the best eats in town.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

There are three requirements which I look for in a restaurant; service, deals, and food quality. \\n\\nI would not suggest Osaka as a place to go catch up with friends, because you will end up leaving frustrated. The service was lacking. We came around lunch, and it was quiet, yet we were missing many basic essentials such as plates when our appetizers had come out and drinks were not refilled regularly. \\n\\nThe food was decent, but nothing particularly special. I ordered the lunch bento box with broiled unagi and grilled salmon. My salmon was on the dry side and I had to douse it in lemon juice and toss it in the excess miso dressing from my salad. The unagi was delicious, but it was the most anorexic eel I have ever eaten. It was mostly skin, but that was cooked beautifully with a nice crunch. It came with rice, a salad, two pieces of gyoza, and two pieces of California roll for 15 dollars. This was a decent price, but I was left underwhelmed. \\n\\nI was looking at their lunch special which gave you a choice of one main for 8 bucks.

There are so many fabulous places to have a nice dinner in Charlotte and this did not impress. I have a fabulous Lobster Bisque - creamy shellfish soup, lump crab meat, sherry creme fraiche.

        "Review: I went to fill up my Nissan Frontier with gas, after finding out a week previously that they had the lowest price on gasbuddy.com. I went in to the office and asked the lady where to fuel up at. She said that a guy will come out to do this for me. She asked me if I wanted unleaded, to which I replied, \\\"Yes.\\\" She then placed an announcement on loud speaker which I wasn't paying attention to. I drove over to the pumps where I was met by a guy. When I found out the price was a lot higher than expected, I told him to only put in 5 gallons. He gave me a receipt which I took in to the office. She was surprised that it read E85 and asked the guy to confirm. It was E85!!!\\n \\nThe guy who fueled up said they could clean out my tank. When I asked how this could have happened, a manger came out, David Kec. He told me they would give me 5 gallons of unleaded to dilute the E85 and that I shouldn't have any problems with my vehicle. Whilst they did this I did some research on google, this could potentially ruin my fuel injector system!!! I went back in to get a copy of the E85 receipt and when I asked them to write on the receipt that they put it into my truck's tank accidentally, Mr. Kec came out again. Mr. Kec told me they were not willing to do this and said that the guy who fueled my truck said I asked for E85! What a liar!!!! The guy who fueled up my truck actually admitted that he didn't ask me what gas to input, and said that Chris (whoever that is) told him to put in E85. Mr Kec needs to go back to customer service school. I can only assume that Chris was the girl at the front desk asked for E85 on the loud speaker or the guy fueling didn't hear the announcement correctly. I told Mr. Kec, they need to improve on their communication skills. Mr. Kec also should have had my truck's tank siphoned out. Why would I ask for E85 when I know damn well that I drive a standard truck with a standard fuel tank?! It's also more expensive than unleaded. I didn't even know until today what E85 was!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

My food took 30 minutes to get and that was after waiting in line for 10-15 minutes in their non-air-conditioned building. The food was good but average and quite a lot of excess tortilla compared to the amount of filling, and the sauce was quite salty.

        "Review: I would call this place, 'Mi Patio, the Gringo-Mexican Restaurant'. I say that, first off, because of the high ratings this place received - out of the 25+ people eating here there was not one Mexican sitting down for food - not even at the bar. My waiter wasn't even Mexican... He was a white guy. I'm white, too, but I live in San Diego and I'm 20 miles from Mexico, and I eat bomb Mexican food for a hobby.  My Chimichanga was weak (I know its Tex-Mex haha). I was disappointed by the softness, and the lack of anything but shredded meat (the quality of the meat was good) despite my add-ons. My company felt the same about theirs.  I really hate to give this place two stars because the service was soooo GOOD and it's a place with some character. I never had an empty glass of drink or bowl of their 'milder than rice' red salsa. I just can't give it a 3 looking at all these 5s, 'cause that's the story of how I got duped.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

The women on the phone told me it was all night. This is why we decided to go here over Kona Grill, which was a huge mistake. We got there and ordered. The server we had was new which was no problem, I'm in the service industry and understand that being new is hard, but the service was very slow and I could tell she was frazzled. When it came to the check it showed that none of the stuff we ordered was at the happy hour price. I asked the manager about it and she told me I got incorrect information about the happy hour times and there was nothing she could do about it.

The food was also served with some complimentary bread rolls and we had some sweet pink lemonade to wash it all down.

Like all good diners, service is friendly, they keep the coffee cup full, and know how to crank through tables.

I had a dress dry cleaned there and it cost almost $20! For 1 item!! Needless to say I wanted to find a place cheaper and closer to my house. So after doing some online research I picked this place, which at the time had $2.25 per item cleaning and only took cash or debit cards. \\n\\nI have always been satisfied by the quality of the cleaning done to my clothes here. I have gotten some pretty gnarly stains on some of my silk work dresses and they have always been able to get them out. One of the hazards of eating lunch at your desk I guess. I only had one incident where there might have been some damage done to one of my dresses but I wasn't too upset about it since the quality of the beading done on the dress was crappy at best. So I don't entirely blame them for a bunch of my beads falling off. \\n\\nThe only complaint I probably have is that they miscounted my items one time and I almost walked out missing a dress. And this seems to happen on some kind of regular basis because I have been in there a time or two when some guy is missing some shirts or someones dress has disappeared. I hope that if they do lose garments, management at least has the decency to replace for the lost cost. The workers aren't the most friendly but they aren't total jerks either. Just sort of... there. \\n\\nI recommend this cleaner based on quality and price. However, in the last year the have upped their prices a bit because they got a new credit card machine and now they charge for all sorts of taxes. Either way, its still reasonable. But they do have a text service where they offer discounts and promotions sometimes. I have not participated in that yet but I know its out there.\n\nStars:",

Around 6:25am, the bus arrived indeed, and I thought that would be the one taking us to the Canyon. I was mistaken though. The first bus only took us out of downtown Las Vegas, and brought us to a collective station where all travelers to west and south rim that booked with the company were gathered. A friendly staff member explained the further procedure to us: we would split up in two groups now (one west rim-travelers, others going to the south), then check-in (a process that only takes half a minute getting us stickers for the appropriate bus as well as the skywalk-wristbands), then have a quick breakfast, and then (finally!) leave for the Grand Canyon.\\nI have to say that part of the day annoyed me, since it seemed like a long waiting period, and all I wanted is to get on the bus.\\nThe breakfast snack was ok, a small orange juice and coffee as well as a danish was provided for free. After having food, the west rim travelers were asked to queue for their buses.\\n\\nThis is when the tour really started to be great fun.\\nFirst of all, the buses are really comfortable, clean and modern.

The traffic was backed up on the freeway and the main street was a mess.

People were very frustrated cutting others off in traffic, being aggressive and I witnessed a road rage incident while sitting in the line.  By the time I made it to the Marriott lot, they had been out of spaces for 15 minutes but they did not have a method to notify people.  I blame the Marriot for most of the mess but the City of Tempe need to plan better for events.\\nInside the stadium I found the place to be less than average for Spring Training games.  The food was not good, the customer service was average and we could not hear the speakers very well.  I will stick to other Spring Training facilities to see some games in the future.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review text:\nIt's hard to say anything really bad about this place, but then again, it's also hard to say anything good about it. I guess if I had to characterize this bar/restaurant I would say that it's mediocre in almost every way. Let me start with the beer selection: not a lot on draft. The fact that a supposedly Irish bar doesn't have staples like Smithwick's or Guinness is disappointing. The food is hit or miss. The vegetable melt was extremely soggy and unappetizing, but the firecracker tacos were acceptable. I wouldn't go here expecting too much. The price isn't bad, but it's more than the food is worth.\n\nReview rating:",

        "I was really hopeful for the Penguin because I had 6 years ago and it was a pretty good experience. \\n\\nUnfortunately it was an awful experience this afternoon for lunch. There were only 2 other small groups there and our food took over 30 minutes. We ordered the fried pickles as an appetizer, which are close to $7, and they came in a SMALL cardboard container, enough for maybe 1 person's share of an appetizer. It was a rip off. The burger was mediocre, slightly dry and nothing spectacular. I've had better at home. At least the waitress was nice, but the overall restaurant was not a good one.... Spend less on a better burger elsewhere!\nSo I would like to give it",

If you think about it, you really have to go out of your way to screw up breakfast but they managed.\\n\\nWe knew we were off to a bad start when we stood at the entrance for about 5 minutes (Please Wait to be Seated) for someone to seat us in a 1/2 empty dining room. The waiter was attentive so no problems there. The problems started when the food arrived. 3 of us had menu variations of corn-beef hash and poached eggs. The corn-beef had the look and texture of road kill and the eggs were hard boiled. 2 of us requested that the eggs be re-done but only one of us received it after assurances from the wait staff that it was \\\"on its way...\\\". The food was also more or less room temp when it arrived.\\n\\nTo be fair, there are a lot of Chompie's and maybe this was a bad day at a singe location. The menu is extensive and I did see other customers orders that looked more appetizing. It would appear that they have good food but the execution was the problem. We might try it again and order something different.\n\nReview rating:",

The room was super clean and nicely decorated, spectacular river view over looking the Pittsburgh skyline, Heinz Field and PNC Park. Best part..The room was very quiet, ultra deluxe beds that was heavenly and the complimentary hot chocolate and marshmallows that was waiting in our room after a chilly evening stroll where all nice touches. Can't beat the location, we where within walking distance of many great restaurants, bars, shopping and public transportation. Amazing hotel! Super sweet staff. Will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Pittsburgh.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I went to this Applebees to grab a late dinner one night earlier this month and I will never go back.  Among entering I noticed this place looks a little outdated and dirty.  We were seated next to a table were the servers seemed to be hanging out at.  They  were very loud and obnoxious, and were brought plate after plate of food.  Which, is probably why it took so long for our food to arrive, because the kitchen was too busy feeding its staff.  The food was also not very good, I had a sandwich which was very burnt.  My boyfriend had fish and chips, and although the portion was very large the fish was overly breaded and fried which made it unbelievable crunchy.  My friend got a jalepano burger which dripped a sort of green, slimy residue as if the kitchen just poured them out from a can.  My other friend got orange chicken, which was just breaded chicken nuggets with an \\\"orange\\\" sauce over frozen rice and vegetables.  Our waitress was nice, but she spent too much time at the table adjacent to us eating with the other servers.  This restaurant just lost 4 customers in one dining experience.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Saucy, lots of green and white onions, but still had plenty of beef.  Hubby had mu shu pork.   Four generously stuffed Chinese creeps with their sauce.

        "Review text:\nVisiting my brother this last weekend.  He took me to this place.  \\n\\nI have no Idea why I had never thought of this before but it is so smart.  Italian Fast Food.  And Good fast food too.  My brother had some coupons so we were expecting to get a killer deal just like he had done in the past.\\n\\nThis place has some really cool deals.  On Weeknights (just weeknight I think) kids eat free!  My brother and his wife have two kids so they both got a slice of pizza and a small kids soda with a plastic keeper cup.  My brother and his wife enjoyed two meals for the price of one thanks to one of their coupons.  I also used a coupon to get $4.99 all you can eat spaghetti!   I think the whole meal for all 5 of us came out to less than $15!!!\\n\\nThe problem was that the manager on duty did not like the idea of us mixing the \\\"kids eat free\\\" deal with the coupons.  I can understand how she felt; I have worked my share of fast food and restaurant jobs.  The problem is my brother has been coming to this exact location for dinner a few times a month for a couple months now and he has never had a problem before.  In the end the manager let us mix the deals we were eligible for but she made us do it as 3 separate purchases.  \\n\\nNow, about the food.   This is not Olive Garden or Old Spaghetti factory.  You are expecting too much if you think you will be getting some kind of Gourmet Italian food for $4.99 a plate from a restaurant with a drive-thru.  However it is good.  The breadsticks were also very good and all-you-can-eat. (Again, no Olive Garden breadsticks, but good, think decent pizza place breadsticks)  The portions were also decent.  Even with the All-you-can eat meal that I got I only had room to get seconds, but not thirds or fourths etc.  \\n\\nI would like to try the pizza, if I am in the area again I will go back.\n\nReview rating:",

Unfortunately, the facts of my experience  have to support otherwise. Allow me to explain:\\n\\n1) Called to schedule an appointment without problem.  They answer promptly, and schedule out for just over a week's time.  The appointment is on a Friday at 1pm.  Great so far.\\n\\n2) They ask for insurance information in which I did not have on me at the time.  I called back and  they take the information down and indicate they support my insurance.  They explain they will call them and get any additional information they need from them.  They then proceed to make their first mistake and confirm a 12:30 appointment time.  I check my calendar and correct that we scheduled for a 1pm.  She indicated she sees where she messed up and says sorry and asks for a change to 12:45.  That is no problem on my end I say and that is that. \\n\\n3) I receive a reminder phone call a few days before the appointment and they are calling to confirm 12:30.  I can't believe how inept they are beginning to sound in their scheduling department.  Starting to worry me now about my decision to choose this dentist office.\\n\\n4) I to my appointment and fill out the paperwork needed.  Upon turning it in, they look to see I have filled out my insurance portion and they proceed to ask, \\\"oh, you do have insurance, we don't have you down as having insurance\\\" .  Keep in mind bullet 2 where I made a phone call to them specifically giving them my insurance information.\\n\\n5) Waiting a few more minutes they explain they are going to have to do another full set of x rays on my mouth.  Typically, a full set is allowed by insurance once every 5 years on a patient. This is in the range of $500 to get these done.  In between these full mouth x rays, dentist commonly use the bite wings where you bite down on a white wing and they take a small x ray of that portion of your mouth to check for...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

(I understand Nathan Y's review) However, once the food started flying and the owner began razz-ma-tazzing with my party, we had a great time and meal.\\n\\n~ Loved the boiled peanuts\\n~ Loved the veggie apps: bean sprouts, Napa cabbage and turnups, he brought us a second batch.\\n~ My teenage nephews (human garbage cans, or robotic eating machines, take your pick) were tapping uncle with the gut-bombs that were fried rice and 5 egg omelets.\\n~ My bro had the combo plate with the ribs, chicken & egg mixture. He said he would order it again.\\n~ I had the Teriyaki Pork. I had to ask what cut it was, I thought belly since it was thin and like bacon. It's pork loin cut really thin and marinated. It was one of the best pork dishes I've ever had. It has a sweet taste, it eats like candy. Really, really good & I don't care for sweet dishes by and large.\\n\\nGreat place, that is a hike, but worth the hike. Very cool owner working the front while his wife cooks in back. 5 stars for the food. The place itself would be a hole without the food and owners jivin' & cookin'.\nSo I would like to give it",

Eccentric and cool.\\nBut what really brings me here is the after hours\\nThis place is great if you like house DJs and constantly shiver from the dousche chills at most other Vegas clubs.\\nIts free for locals and open 24 hours on friday and saturdays. The crowd is whatever, and the back patio is a nice place to throw down on a conversation.  For my money its the best place for random run ins, example, a couple weeks ago my Mclovin looking friend starts laying random \\\"I just broke up with my girlfriend so I really dont give a f**k\\\" style convo into a brunette about 3 leagues above him. She bites and they talk for a while and when the number exchange came, she said, \\\"you can find me on twitter, its @jennyhendrix\\\". \\nSure, this is Vegas, that happens here, but then last week, I spent about 5 minutes talking to someone when she said \\\"you look familiar\\\" and I replied with my \\\"o, you must watch gay porn\\\" bit. \\nShe laughed it off and then confessed to me she had done some porn and told me her name etc etc... \\nI dont really know the point other than establishing a baseline for the type of people who go here. Maybe nooooooot your babys mama, but then again, who am I to judge,  everybody needs to rock out sometimes right?\\n\\nO and FYI, the Hotel is Valet only, but you can just drive past it and park down the street if you like.\n\nStars:",

        "After being a loyal customer to this location and a UPS My Choice customer, I was extremely disappointed in their policy over a mishandled package. I attempted to send a birthday present to my father in Atlanta and after it did not arrive in time, it show up back at our house in Charlotte. I was told that their policy is to resend it or to receive a credit and I could send it through another provider. It may seem extreme to complain, when I could just resend it for free, but when a company fails to perform their primary service, I feel that they should make things right with the customer. This means going beyond offering the same service you failed to perform in the first place. Having lost faith that this location can perform a core competency and their questionable customer service, for the foreseeable future, I will be taking my business elsewhere and canceling my UPS account.\nSo I would like to give it",

The last time I went, I had a few gift cards in my door and when I got back in, they were gone. I asked about them, and all I was told was \\\"they have signs telling you not to leave valuables in your car\\\".  The GM, Del, told me he will give me a basic car wash for my troubles, but he can't verify if they were in there or not. So after spending $100 per month there, $150 if you include my other car, they are going to take my $50 in gift cards and give me a $15 wash. Thanks for going out of your way champ! Go to Charleston West Car Wash if you want the best wash in town. I dealt with them for years and they were always great, but when I moved to Green Valley, I started going to this place. Not any longer. I will drive out of my way to go to Charleston from now on. Oh yea, they still hand wash your car unlike Green Valley \\\"formerly hand\\\" Car Wash!\n\nStars:",

It was not overly soaked in sugar, delicately flavored with cardamom and other yummy spices.  Husnu came out of the kitchen to greet us personally.  Then again, I was making a giant fuss about how awesome this baklava tasted and ordered a few portions to take back to Florida.  I was delighted to find that Husnu threw in a few extra 'ends' to round out my portion at no charge.  I was eating baklava for days.  Incidentally, it traveled very well and tasted great even after flying a thousand miles south.  My only regret is that I don't live in Madison and cannot get more of Husnu's amazing baklava.

We had a French Dip... which after the bill came we learned was $16.00... if my High School served french dips.. it would have been better.

This one, I hadn't seen in almost 21 years and thanks to FB we got reconnected. \\n\\nMacAyo's is another local Mexican chain restaurant. This location is the newest probably open about 8 or 9 years now. Long ago, the location on Central Avenue was all the rage, but like any chain, sometimes growth does not necessarily equate to great.\\n\\nMy friend and I shared a cheese crisp. I like the one here better than the one at Garcia's. I also had a shredded beef taco and black beans and rice. The taco had much better flavor than Garcia's and the beans were good. We each had a house margarita and I only drank half. Not because I was getting sauced, but because it was kind of nasty. \\n\\nAll in all decent, but not blow me away good. Might come back but there are several other great Mexican food restaurants in the Valley that I will have to visit next time. Sadly with mom living in Sun City West, the schlep to get to some of these places is a bit too great.\\n\\nThe waiter again was nice and accommodating.

It's not that the seats are more comfy or the food is better.  No, we sit there because 1) there are TVs to watch football but mostly 2) because of the AWESOME bartenders!  Shelly has got to be one of my favorite people in Charlotte, and her partners in crime are also friendly.  She is so friendly and sweet and sassy--a great combo in a bartender!  \\n\\nThe food, of course, is great too, otherwise we wouldn't keep coming back.  My husband adores the brisket (it IS delicious!).  I have had the turkey burger and the regular burger and loved both of those.  Usually on Sundays I get something from the brunch menu.  My only complaint is that it's a bit lacking in length, but there are pretty good things on it.  I have liked the waffles, I have also had the BELT (which was alright) and the French Toast (which was good, but ask for the fruit compote on the side).  The grits (if you have read any of my previous reviews, you'll know that I LOVE GRITS!!) are good.  They clearly make them with chicken broth, which almost makes them too chicken-y, but they also have cheese.  They're very good. (Today, in fact, they lacked the signature chicken flavor, and were some of the best grits I've ever had!)  \\n\\nMy husband has had the French Dip Sandwich (pretty good), pork tenderloin (also pretty good--not outstanding) and the Cajun omelette (just okay), but he remains convinced that you should just get the brisket.  For $13, you get a lot of delicious brisket with BBQ sauce, excellent fries, and one more side (it comes with cole slaw, but we've never gotten it.  The green beans were good when I had them).  I have also ordered the brisket, and he's right, it is FANTASTIC!!!\\n\\nOn Thursday they have trivia night.

Dining room seating usually tends to take longer and the servers aren't as attentive, definitely not good for a quick lunch. \\n\\nAppetizers to try are; the cheese plate, Sweet & Sour Calamari (my fav) and their Mussel Pot. They have a great sushi selection, I normally have their Spider and Firecracker Roll which is always fresh and perfect. I recently tried their Queen City Roll and its absolutely delicious paired with a glass of Conundrum. The mashed potatoes and baby green beans are a great side dish for any of their menu items.

        "This review is actually for the Arizona Kitchen.\\n\\nWent here for a Sunday breakfast. The place is very purty. When we arrived there was only one other table that was occupied, so we were seated right away. The menu is small and we knew what we wanted right away. I got the eggs benedict and the husband got a similar item , but it contained salmon and a different type of sauce.\\n\\nThe husband ordered some coffee and said it was some of the best coffee he has had in a long time. Our food arrived very quickly and was very pleased overall with the the eggs benedict. The only complaint that I had was that the sauce was cold..not even warm, cold. I had to take a bite with the egg and ham to make sure that i got a warm bite. My husband was pleased with his as well,but his sauce was also cold.\\n\\nour server came to see how we were doing and I mentioned that the sauce was cold, instead of addressing the issue she just turned around and left and a few seconds later a lady came over to say that the hollandaise was supposed to be served cold. Hmmmm...I am no chef, but I have never had a cold sauce before. She never apologized, it seemed as though she was almost mocking me...like I obviously did not about food...whatever. She was not the perfect hostess, but I would not judge the place on her alone. The place is very quaint and I may go back to try some other items besides breakfast. I have heard that they serve a great dinner here, and I will definetly go back to check it out. My rating for this place is",

It oddly worked and I enjoyed the meal before I had to hit the road. The fries our table shared was also a winner as they were crispy and uniformly cut and fluffy potato goodness in the middle. Definitely a great cheap eats spot.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Oh $.85 tacos, how you fill life with purpose and beefy joy. For $.85 a piece you can't beat these tacos, pair them with a beer, and some self-brought dance party and you have a seriously bitchin' Tuesday.\\n\\nWe usually have beef soft shell tacos and Straub beers. Keep in mind for you veg-heads there is also the option of bean tacos (and hard shell too). They have a margarita special on Tuesdays, although I've not tried them so I can't really comment on their deliciousness. \\n\\nThe bartenders are awesome fun and it's always pretty laid back during the week with a pretty consistent regular crowd.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "I came across Easy Moves through Angies List as a very reputable mover. I will say that I was very impressed with the professionalism of the people I spoke with over the phone for a quote and the movers themselves. Over the phone, they quoted me two hours and it actually ended up being 4 hours. However, I was okay with that because they handled all of our furntiure in a safe manner as fast as they could. I watched the entire time and these guys busted their humps trying to go as fast as they could knowing what was quoted. As with any move, minor knicks and scratches are expected. One of the movers knicked the wood off in the door frame of the master bedroom. The very next business day they had their contractor come out and fix door frame. Also, after signing the bill, I noticed that the movers miscalculated the hours and overcharged me. I called them right away and they got it all straightened out. Overall, was very pleased with the work they did for us. My rating for this place is",

        "Review: For many years Dillard's was my favorite store. However I have noticed a decided lack of initiative these last few months. Dresses that were identical except for the color were priced differently. Trying to return a dress ( for the first time ever) when I saw it had gone on sale during the last 10 days I was told they didn't have time to change the tag right now and it would have to be put in the back. I was also told Dillard's won't honor the current sales price because they \\\"don't play games.\\\"There were 3 saleswomen and me in the whole department yet not one of them could mark the dress down?! If they don't play games why not price the identical dresses with identical price tags to start with? Another clerk in a different department explained they keep the item in the back for 72 hours before putting it out again. Presumably this is meant to discourage smart shoppers. Since then I have sent two emails and not recieved a reply. There are too many stores where pricing is lower, policies more friendly and staff less haughty for these kinds of tactics. I will be speaking with my wallet and taking my business elsewhere\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "First the good things about the bar. There is live music which is good and there is ample outdoor seating. The food is good but not excellent.\\n\\nThe bad things: The waitress is extremely rude. She refused to give us a beer menu and asked us to just go to the bar and take a look at what beers they have. She took a long time to service at the bar. So I get some beers, tip the waitress at the tip jar and later she comes outside and shouts at me saying that I wouldn't be getting any beers unless I tip her. I told her that I'd complain to the manager and that I did tip her at the tip jar, to which she said she didn't care and walked away. They have a bad beer selection too.\\n\\nI am never going to Iron Post again and wouldn't recommend others to go. There are other very good and hospitable bars close by.\\n\\n[Edit] The waitress I was talking about sent me this message at yelp. \\\"Dude, stay in the library. You obviously don't understand the idea of cool. You parents will be proud of their engineer loser son.\\\"\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "I'm not a huge KFC fan, but I heard about their chicken pot pies and had to try them out for myself. We asked for three pies, but they only had two pies ready to sell, the next pies would have been ready 19 minutes later. When I got my pie, I could see why. I was expecting a tiny, microwaveable pie, but what I got was much better! This was definitely a hearty meal. The pie had lots of yummy crust on the outside and a wealth of chicken, carrots, peas, and potatoes inside. It was delicious. And I believe it was only $3.99, with a drink included! I will definitely be revisiting KFC for these pies, especially. My rating for this place is",

        "Review text:\nAs there is only one other book store of this sort in Champaign, I suppose the comparisons with Jane Addams (in downtown Champaign) can't be helped.  While I appreciate the organization and atmosphere of Jane Addams, I have found far more gems in Priceless Books.  There is a high turnover on stock at Priceless Books, and I have been able to purchase all kinds of obscure manuals, anthologies, and critical essays there.  For those who love classical music, the store also carries a large collection of CDs.\\n\\nWhen it comes to price, I would say that Priceless Books and Jane Addams are comparable, though Jane Addams is usually more expensive for the type of books I read (classic literature).  Hardbacks are, of course, in a more expensive range (usually more than $15), but most books at Priceless Books are about half the cost of the original cover price, assuming the book was printed in the last 10 years.  Sometimes you can find real steals, as I was able to buy a limited-print anthology (still in good condition) for $13, whereas the original value of the book was around $60.\\n\\nIf you have been spoiled by the modern bookstore (like Borders or Barnes & Noble), the general structure of this place would be a nightmare.  The shelves are literally so loaded by books that they look on the verge of collapse.  Printed labels used to designate themes for each section often do not correspond with the books actually found there (hint: look one shelf over and you'll likely find the section you want).\\n\\nEven given its faults, I can't help but call Priceless Books my favorite used bookstore in the area.  Each visit, I spend hours browsing its shelves, and I am rarely disappointed in what I can find.\n\nReview rating:",

Took a while to get things organized. \\nStopped near the dam, a rest stop in Kingman, Az, then had a decent lunch in Williams, Az. The south rim is quite a drive. Once we got there, we had a couple of stops at the canyon for about an hour each, then headed back with one stop again in Kingman, Az. The south rim is a long trip, prepare accordingly. We got back around 9:30 or so. Our driver, Tommy, was excellent and informative.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "For a white girl, I frequent Lee Lee's often. But thankfully I see folks of all flavors there and I just love it. \\n\\nI like the meat and seafood counter, and the one less star Lee Lee gets is for forcing me to buy a package of beef tenderloin instead of being able to pick up the one or two that I need for making pho tai. But the prices are great, so I make the pho and have steak the next day. \\n\\nThe produce section is great. Eggplants of all shapes and size! Lots of fresh herbs at great prices. All the cabbages you can stuff in your cart and haul home. \\n\\nI spend a little more time in this section for two reasons. First, sometimes the jalapenos are a little soft or herbs a little wilted so taking a few extra seconds to choose the best of the bunch. Plus, it seems like all the other patrons there touch every single item in every bin they shop from. I mean really, what's up with that? I can sit there patiently waiting for minutes while some lady picks up and puts down 487 bunches of sweet basil. Is that really necessary? And are these folks completely without spatial awareness and don't see me sitting there begging with my eyes for them to hurry so I can choose the best of three bunches and hit the road? Scoot your ass over lady and let me join the fun. But nooooo lest I get the prized collection of basil so good she'll only see that bunch once this lifetime, so I just wait my turn The produce section is agonizing for me. \\n\\nI like the organization of the store for the most part, as it makes it easy for me to find the related foods. My Swedish ethnicity makes these aisles not only fun, but educational. \\n\\nSpice aisle is your friend. Pick up some Star Anise in a bag big enough to last a lifetime for cheap. Take that McCormick spice jars! See if I ever buy anything from you again. \\n\\nI always spend a little time picking out some sweet treats in the candy section. Personal favorite Men's Pocky. Not sure why the dark chocolate is for men. Are the the milk chocolate ones for women? Why, because women can...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nCustomer service was terrible and for being the first time I have ever been to one of these places, I felt very uncomfortable. I was not even sure if they were open. I went to planned parenthood to get the morning after pill because I researched that it was less awkward getting it from a place where everyone who is in there is there for pretty much the same reason. The greeting and customer service was mediocre up until my card came up as declined. I just checked my bank account because I am always paranoid about the amount of money in my account and I had over 200$ in there. The lady all of the sudden became rude and irritated that my card was declined. I was confused and told her that I would step aside and call my bank to hopefully clear up the confusion, oh i was also the ONLY customer in the building so it was not like I was holding up a line or anything. Then no longer than 15 seconds away from the window, my card magically worked. I quickly signed my receipt because I wanted to run out of there and I lastly ask if it was my card or another error that had occurred and she just rudely says it was my card. I left with no \\\"goodbye thank you\\\" and will definitely never go back there. I would have rather been judged by the grocery store cashier than had to deal with planned parenthood.

It was so spicy that this white boy was sweating through the cheap paper napkins (5) that this place provides. Another free birthday meal and chicken fajitas were the choice. Chicken was sliced too thin,  but had no trace of the promised spices and chilies. It was just grilled chicken with plenty of onions and peppers and the usual condiments. Still, a solid safe choice for a chain, but not sure why every waiter in the bar was gay. Nothing wrong with that, but both my waiter and my chip and salsa guy were on the other team and that was a bit unusual. Also, I know it's a Mexican chain, but we are in America and nobody really needs to listen to full-on Mexican tunes during dinner. IF i want the full experience, I will just go the east side of Vegas and find some taco joint with bars on the windows.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

Secondly, the prices are usually about 20 % higher than I can get elsewhere.

        "Review text:\nComedian Brian Regan deserved better....and so did my friend and I. Perhaps I should have thrown comparisons to other similar venues out the window, but there are just certain staples that are found (and should be) at most places that host live entertainment. \\n\\nLet's start at the door: Talk about unorganized. No lines just a sea of bodies, people doing the push and shove (which is unacceptable unless it's at the Nordstrom Rack), and harried and cranky ticket takers. \\n\\nClear and visible signage to direct you to the correct location: Negative. We walked halfway around the darn place before we realized we were on the OTHER side. Good luck trying to find someone to ask directions (see the note about the ushers below). \\n\\nUshers: Here is a quote: \\\"Um, yeah, your seats are over there (points in a general direction and then turns away). \\\" My companion and I looked at each other perplexed since we had just came from \\\"over there\\\" and that was not the right area. Bad usher, bad. \\n\\nSeating: Appropriate for individuals the size of two year olds, not for the average size adult. Every time the woman next to me took a breath, I could literally feel her inhaling and exhaling. Only her doctor or significant other should be that close to her, and I am sure she felt the same way about me. \\n\\nCherry on Top: I wanted a glass of water. Nothing fancy, just water. My companion got up and made his way out to the lobby. When he came back, he had 1 beer and 1 glass of ice cubes. The line he got in did not serve water, and when he asked for a glass full of ice cubes to compensate, they got all pissy with him. I guess I should be glad they didn't make him pay for it. \\n\\nDodge gets one star automatically for having Brian Regan grace their location. The other star is for the pre-show rolling text messages across the video screens. It is an interesting concept and great way to keep the audience entertained beyond the usual onslaught of advertising material.\n\nStars:",

        "A few friends had sworn up and down Sullivans was cheaper and better than other quality chain steakhouses we carnivores adore. As the much beloved, highly anticipated QC restaurant week is off the starting gates, Sullivans is the first stop in this possible gout inducing road trip of gluttony that would make Henry the VIII envious. \\n\\nFirst impressions aren't much to gloat about. While calling for a reservation, I was told 8:45 was the next available spot. After having to confirm with my dinner mates, I had to wait on hold for ohhhh only a measly 7 or 8 minutes. Hmrph, lets try this again. Hung up and redialed, new person and now it's 8:30; uh okay that works, lets roll on out! \\n\\nUpon arrival, complimentary valet - not too shabby. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated so, \\\"please enjoy yourselves at the bar and listen to the live jazz band.\\\" I can dig it, dirty martini time! At only $10 for house vodka, oh Sullivans you sly dog, I like you already. \\n\\nBingo! Our names were called to be seated and after you wait for the hostesses to finish gossiping amongst themselves and finally seat you, the adventure begins. The dining room is lined with booths and a nifty library looking room adds to the Chicago, Dick Tracy-esque decor. The booths though, don't really sit 4 people comfortably. \\n\\nSince it's restaurant week, the $30 meal is offered along with a \\\"Summer of '69\\\" for two which has slightly different options and two sides. Apparently its offered all summer and cost $69, heh go figure. \\n\\nSummer of 69 it is, with asparagus and crab fried rice as sides.

        "This past experience at Bonterra was, well, surely better than last time but I'm still not a convert to this gorgeous restaurant. To set the scene, hubs and I took my parents here for a late dinner in celebration of my mom's birthday. \\n\\nThe Good: The herb butter for our delicious bread, the amazing and extensive wine selection (especially wine by the glass), the lovely interior (it's an old church renovated into a restaurant).\\n\\nThe Meh: While my mom loved her scallop dish (I ordered the same), I thought it was just ok. The scallops were cooked perfectly but the sweet potato puree was entirely too sweet for my liking and the dish lacked texture. I also tried some of hubs' peach souffle and I didn't taste much peach, only eggy souffle. For the record, I'm not a huge souffle fan, so take that for what it's worth. \\n\\nThe Service: This gets a category of its own. It's traditional paced/slower service which can be just fine. Our server was very polite and friendly and provided some great suggestions in terms of wine and entrees. However, he became a bit absent nearing the end. Yes, we started dinner a bit late at 9 pm, but I expect that great service to continue through the end of my meal. He must have misunderstood us, as the gentlemen at the table pre-ordered their souffles but my mother and I would have liked to order our own desserts. By the time the souffles (and our serve) returned to our table we honestly didn't want to wait to order another round of treats. He also didn't offer us any coffee to finish off our meal. Yes, all these things I could have gotten up from the table and fetched him, but I wasn't in the mood to chase. \\n\\nSo, Bonterra, for me, is just ok. I wasn't blown away by the food or the service but I wasn't super disappointed either.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nI was a bit disappointed with VOLR. Absolutely loved the interior space and the location, in the hip Roosevelt/3rd Ave area, sandwiched between Lola Coffee and Pita Jungle. \\nWhat I didn't love was the experience I received. I will not say the name of my stylist, because I don't think that the person deserves to be punished. They did an OK job, but just OK. \\n\\nI have long hair, and I requested a very simple cut. I asked for 2-3 inches off, and instead I received 1 inch off. I asked for swoopy side bangs, and received bangs that were a bit jagged and did not align with my natural part. I had to cut them myself at home. I came in with a picture of myself with straight hair, which is my hair's natural state, and told the person it was exactly what I wanted.  Instead, I received curls set in place with tons & tons of hairspray , which I first thought was a nice extra touch (especially because they use nice Bumble & Bumble products) but later regretted because I HATE hairspray and I ended up washing it all out a few hours later. \\n\\nI feel like my stylist wasn't really listening and did what they wanted rather than what I requested. I will say that they gave a pretty good head massage. Maybe it was an off day for the stylist and for the salon. Maybe I should have spoken up more. I don't know. I just know that you shouldn't have to go home and cut your hair yourself after dropping $55 at a fancy salon.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

First off its a nice little spot, with a mom and pop shop feel. The old man at the front wasn't welcoming - I had a couple questions about the meal I was ordering and he acted as if I was stupid and was supposed to know. When I finally got my gyro I was fairly disappointed to say the least - I had tamato ends and no real slices and very little onion with no taziki on the sandwich- it came in a little cup, i had more gyro meat than their street taco sized pita could handle. Sloppily thrown together and thrown into a bag. Rude old man at the front and I paid 4$ more than I would for just the sandwich at my regular spot (flaming kabob).

        "Review: My initial thoughts of this place was of a dirty hole in the wall restaurant. When I finally stopped by I found out it wasn't so bad. I heard and driven by this place many times but never really had a hankering to stop in and try the food. \\n\\nTonight, I was not feeling well and wanted a nice, hot bowl of Pho. I decided to finally give this place a shot. I placed my order to go (#11 Pho with beef and beef balls - $6.50 total) and took a seat and waited. I did not have to wait long, I got my food fairly fast. For the short 5-10 minutes I waited, I saw several appealing rice, noodles and seafood dishes passing by me from the kitchen to different tables that I now have to come back and try. Everything looked so appetizing which usually isn;t the case when you're feeling sick.\\n\\nAnyway, back to the Pho... when I arrived home, I fixed up my hearty bowl of Pho. The portion was huge! More than I can finish. The bean sprouts, mint and lime that accompanied were nice and fresh. The broth was very flavorful and not very oily. Usually, I'd want to add a bunch of lime, hoison sauce and sriracha but tonight it was perfect with just a squirt of lime and the fresh veggies. The broth was still very hot, too. \\n\\nI will definitely go back for more Pho and also to try other items. Prices here are very affordable.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "This resort is really set up for golfers. It's not young, it's not hip. It's not in a great location for going out. However, if you end up staying here and don't golf there's still plenty to do as long as your plan is to relax. Otherwise to get \\\"off campus\\\" expect to pay a minimum of $20 for a taxi.\\n\\nThe resort has some small pools set up for guests that reminded me of Melrose Place - lounge chairs, hot tubs, palm trees and a small clubhouse with bathrooms and endless towels. You can also call and order poolside food & beverage service. When I was there a few weeks ago it was just me and a few other people at the pool. I got to read a lot in the sun. If you're looking for more excitement then you can try out their water park - a nice lazy river and two really tall scary fun slides. However if you go expect it to be filled with kids and families on the weekend.\\n\\nThey also have nice spa services and a pretty well equipped gym with a nice locker room, steam room and therapeutic hot tub. While staying there you can join any of the fitness classes.\\n\\nThe cafe serves decent food and the people working there are super helpful and nice. Example: we had some wine out on the patio for dinner and wanted some nibbles, but didn't want to order a full appetizer. The waitress was nice enough to bring out some fried wontons with dip for us when we explained what we were looking for - all complimentary - and they were yummy. The lunches and dinners I had there were actually much better than anything nearby that was \\\"off campus\\\".\\n\\nThe rooms are okay. Nothing special.

Not impressed with that.\\n\\nOverall, since I had to stay there it was okay but I probably wouldn't choose to come back.\nSo I would like to give it",

Nice view.\\n\\nSince we visited on Homecoming Weekend the place was hopping but that didn't deter their smiles and service attitude (although the parking was full when we arrived but the valet took care of us without a charge).\\n\\nThe location is great, just a couple of blocks off the capital square which makes it easy to visit our other Madison favorite, the Farmer's market that runs each Saturday from about May until October.

        "What used to be a Madison tradition for college students and those looking for a fun gameday place has become an atrocious dump.\\n\\nI went there last Sunday with my wife to watch some football on their big screens upstairs, and boy did it not take long to make us leave.  For starters, we went to the bar upstairs to order some drinks and food, only to have the bartender be fairly rude and gruff when we asked questions.  He looked like a normal college-aged guy, but apparently he must have been hungover or something because he just didn't want to provide any kind of service what so ever.\\n\\nAfter paying for the food, my wife went back up to ask if they put a charge hold on the card because she remembered this from her time at college there, and it turned out they did.  I had no idea about this, and the bartender never mentioned it before I paid.  So it turns out, they put a charge on your card for FIFTY DOLLARS if you pay for anything with it.  The reason is to \\\"make sure you have money in your account\\\".  It's now four days later, and that charge is still sitting on my bank account, tying up money I could have used for other things.\\n\\nDuring this whole process, I was obviously a bit upset but I was calm about it because we wanted to just watch the games and have a good time.  Sadly, the volume on their speakers was set for Rave level, and I was going deaf from the noise level rather than being able to have a conversation and watch the game.  There were literally five people in the place, so I don't understand what they were gearing up for.  One of the big TVs was on ESPN while the other one was on the game, so I went up and asked if they could change it to one of the other football games that was on.  The bartender said it's going to happen (again gruffly), and eventually changed it to a game.\\n\\nWe finally got our food.  What used to be some of the best Madison Cheese Curds are now some over processed orange heap of nuked badness.  My burger looked like it had come out of a turnstyle vending machine. ...\nSo I would like to give it",

They have a pretty awesome deal for a family pack for $60 that seems well worth it. Definitely having this again and very soon. Staff is super friendly and the prices are crazy low for the quality you are getting. Definitely a place to check out for your next party.\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nHodori is set in an all asian strip mall, with 2 or 3 other restaurants. That being said, it was the only one PACKED on a tuesday night. I ordered the kimchi fried rice, being my first time there, I didn't want to go too crazy. Despite being busy, it came out in about 5 mins in a hot stone bowl, with sides of pickled cucumbers, daikon, kimchi, sprouts, tofu, and potatoes, all of which, I stirred right into my rice. It could have used a touch more beef, but the fried egg on top was marvelous. As you get to the bottom of the bowl, the rice is more caramelized and crispy..soo good. I took a bite of the kimchi as I left, and as I was riding my bike home my pallette became the CLEANEST it has ever been, the taste in my mouth was like sweet watermelon. Crazy. Best fried rice ever.\n\nReview rating:",

We called to make an appointment for gels. They booked us. We arrived and they told us we were going to get a complimentary hot wax dip, which I started and as they started to have me pick out the color of nail polish we started to clarify that this was gel nails (because gels don't have nail polish, they are clear). As one of my hands had already been dipped they told us that actually they don't offer the gel service there and there must have been some confusion. We should have left then, but since I had already dipped my hand we decided to stay and get mani-s. They CHARGED me for the wax dip and our nails didn't last two days.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

The place was clean and pleasant but the food was lacking.  \\n\\nFor the price of $15-22 you get one kabob of meat (7-8 inch by inch cubes), plain rice, and one tomato slice. i thought the food was not bad although my two friends did not like it(keep in mind they were middle eastern). it just wasnt enough food for the price. \\n\\nI can get past the slow service, but paying that much for so little was a huge disappointment especially after seeing very high marks for this place on citysearch.\nSo I would like to give it",

The flowers also come delivered tied with two gorgeous organza bows and the whole arrangement is wrapped in cellophane so it is a beautiful presentation.

It is an eclectic place, tastefully done and offers inside and outside seating.  My favorite is sitting at the bar which is a split bar, like a mirror image.  There is something magical about this place in addition to great food.  The lighting in the main dining room is artful--adorned by CX design lighting like walking into a forest of glowing hanging flowers.\\nFor starters we had the humus sampler which was a meal in itself.  I had a hankering for something different and went way outside the Mediterranean venue and right into the meatball hoagie.  I don't know why, but I did and was so rewarded. I am finding the breads in Pittsburgh to be their best kept secret.  My wife had the grape leaves as a diner and it was such a generous portion we needed to take it home. One of our guests had a lamb kabob, that was tasteful but the lamb was a little tough to cut.  I f I get to Pittsburgh again, this is a must.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review: I must admit, I eat here about twice a year.   It's nothing more than typical bar food.  There is certainly nothing fancy about the beer and usually the folks that eat here are just the average working man.  The first time I had hooters was in Miami back in 1992.  In fact, that was the first time I ever had a hot wing!  I have never had such great wings (at least not here).  But what IS good here is the chicken sandwich.  They have many hot flavors.  If you order just NORMAL, the sauce is butter (literally).  I prefer the hottest one which is NUCLEAR.  Even this isn't THAT hot.  They also have 911 sauce.  For the longest time, I thought hooters named their heat sauce after the terrorist attacks because when the planes hit the two towers, a lot of heat was generated!!  As it turns out, it just means DIAL 911!!  THIS SAUCE IS HOT!!  Anyway, go here and get the NUCLEAR CHICKEN SANDWICH!!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nMy wife is Filipina, but I'm not a huge fan of Filipino food. I usually only like the Filipino food she cooks. However, I have to say that I really liked my food from Fiesta Filipina. My wife got pancit with BBQ and I got a two item combo. She sent me off to get it. I think I was the only non-Filipino there. I didn't recognize all of the items, so I had to point at things and ask what they were. I decided on banana leaves in coconut milk and kind of like a pork stew. I also got us fresh melon juice and some garlic peanuts.  Everything was very good. I have been to many Filipino restaurants with my wife, and this is hands down my favorite. The prices are very reasonable too. My wife is glad that I have found a Filipino restaurant I actually want to go back to.\n\nStars:",

Firstly, I knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived. She just seemed...off...or high. She was very awkward and kept flirting with my date. Not only that, but she completely ignored me as if I wasn't sitting right there. \\n\\nTo make matters worse...much worse, our yummy carbonara had a hair in it. A nice long blonde hair. I was done. I pulled it out and showed my date, he looked at it and told me to just get rid of it. Ok, I did, and I stopped eating. He kept eating lol, until...I found another hair!!!!!!!! Yuck!!!! There is nothing worse than someone else's hair in your food. The night was ruined for me, and we both stopped eating, I never speak up when I am unhappy about something. I am just naturally a friendly, non-confrontational girl, but I felt like I had to say something! No one should have to eat food with hair in it, and have to pay $19 for it. \\n\\nAlas, my date didn't want to make things more awkward since  out server seemed to be on the verge of an emotional breakdown. So, I kept quiet against my better judgement. She later returned with the check, which was wrong, and claimed that she would have to pay the difference out of her pocket if she tried to change it. Confused! Then she asked us to do the survey and give her 5 stars. Ha! I just started laughing, I was sure this entire night was a joke. \\n\\nShe literally said, as she knelt down to our table and clasped her hands as if in prayer (I couldn't make this up guys) I'm new here, could you please give me 5 stars, for the good of humanity, and for all those people without jobs in the world.) This was entertaining. Then, she proceeded to take my dates credit card and flirt with him some more! She touched his chest and asked if he had any brothers. Holy...cannoli... get me out of here! I was happy to leave, and planned to never return. That woman just creeped me out. Sorry Buca, a previous visit was much...\n\nStars:",

Not one thing was good. \\n\\nPrime rib that mom and grandma go here for wasn't as good and was well done. I liked the bread pudding and it was because it was butterscotch-y and plentiful with the creamy sauce.... the sauce was tasteless aside from just sugar. The pecan bars with the ends dipped in chocolate used to be fairly decent, but again this lost the flavor and just taste like sugar. Those were the 3 things I used to eat and they didn't satisfy. \\n\\nI really need to convince mom and grandpa to step out of their comfort zone and find someplace else for prime rib because this place sucks.

Back when I used to visit Champaign, I'd get invited to go there for birthdays, graduations or simply if you want to grill minus the clean up.\\n\\nAs mentioned by Melissa, they do have a variety of steak cuts with chicken and pork. If you're a steak lover, you should be able to find numerous nice cuts if you're willing to pay up. Back in the poor college student days, those nice steaks were difficult to avoid. Anyhow, once the steak had been picked out, you simply place it on the big grill, in the middle of the restaurant and you let it dance and sing. You also have the option of letting the waiters / waitresses to cook it for you. The grill is also used for garlic butter texas toast as well as potato-grilling.\\n\\nBesides the grill, there is a salad bar with a decent variety of salads, ranging from typical greens to creamy mac salads or creamy potato salads.\\n\\nGiven a decent list of decent restaurants on the campus of U of I, Alexander's is actually worth while.  I would recommend this place. Hell, go celebrate your birthday or better yet, your A's on your midterm with a nice big juicy rib eye (if you know how to grill) :) My rating for this place is",

        "Review: I've been using this cleaner weekly since I moved here about 7 years ago. Used to be great and they had fun and friendly people working there. They did an ok job ( shirt collars are never pressed well) and I kept returning because it was convenient, the price was fair and the people were great. I've always had a problem getting a center crease in my jeans despite telling them each time when dropping them off. They always said it would absolutely be done since they put in a a little sticker that says \\\"center crease\\\". Every week it would be a 50-50 chance that it was done correctly. But EVERY time I needed them for a trip the next day there was no center crease. \\nNot sure the people doing the laundry actually read the stickers. They always redid them without balking but it's always been a real pain in the a**. Last time was the last straw. I was going on vacation and sure enough, 8 pairs of jeans I brought in were not center creased. I asked to speak with the manager, Larry, but he was on vacation. I took 4 home and repressed them myself and had them redo the others for pick up on my return. By the way, they destroyed a Blue blazer I recently purchased at Nordstrom. Not sure what happened to the fabric but it became full of small wrinkles that could never be fixed at another cleaners so I tossed it out. I haven't seen a friendly face there in the last year. All are young people who seem to be doing this more as a court sentence than as a job. I would be ok with paying a little more for better quality and caring, friendlier service! Maybe a little more time and effort into hiring. I truly would love to see this local business succeed!\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "It sits so inconspciously you can easily miss it if you don't know what you are looking for. Sitting at the headwaters of Mill Avenue, Final Round appears to be very much off the beaten path, a place favored mostly by international aid relief workers, representatives from Western energy coroporations, and the occasional tourist. Almost no one comes here by mistake. \\n\\nThe design is very modest, although there is indoor plumbing. A very large colour television set christens one side of the room, buffeted by a few tables and booths. Opposite this is an imposing bar, and a small area for darts. It is far from tranquil though, and one occaison we were graced by a visit by none other than a roving band of the Ed Hardy Army. It was an impressive sight, even for this hardened war correspondent. The men flexed their muscles under exceedingly tight uniforms, their hats drawn so low over their faces as to obscure their very humanity. The women's physiques also burst at the seams, reinforcing the world's oldest pecking order. A sighting of the Army this far south in Tempe, however, cannot be a good sign. Decades of intergenerational conflict, cultural famine, and poor management of natural resources has left the local population with little means to cope, and the Army's presence can hardly be welcome.\\n\\nWhatever compelled the raid, it likely was not the culinary diversity of Final Round. While the beer is indeed cold, and the food edible, it boasts a menu so small you would assume it was owned by a Scottish expat. I had heard good things about their wings but I never had the patience to try. Expect to find only the most traditional of bar food offerings here, and no local color aside from perhaps Four Peaks ale.\\n\\nService is also annoyingly slow. There is an honest explanation, for the Final Round has often only two people working the floorspace at any given time...and one is usually at the bar. The waitress is usually cheerful, if not overburdened...and that makes up for some of the delay. Still tensions have been... My rating for this place is",

Usually get very good service, but not always. \\n\\nMy favorites:\\nHeathen Vegan (although it seems to depend on who makes it)\\nChicken in a Pie  (be sure you are able to take a nap afterward though)\\nBlue Plate Special Omelet (biscuit quality varies)\\nHomemade Granola (the best!)\\n\\nNot as good:\\nMac and Cheese, Reuben, Chicken/Bacon/Goat Cheese, Artichoke Sandwich, Sweet Potato Hash.\\n\\nI love both their regular and their waffle fries. Always seem to be perfectly cooked.\\n\\nCoffee is usually weak, but at least it's bottomless.\\n\\nTheir blueberry pie was my favorite. I say \\\"was\\\" because they apparently took it off their menu. NOOOOOO!!!!!! I've been fed various lines by the waitstaff during different visits -- that it's seasonal, that they only have it certain days, etc. -- but alas, it appears they've removed it permanently. :( My rating for this place is",

        "I really wasn't thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine, although a bit slow for a not-so-busy Wednesday night. We started with the breaded zucchini, which was about 90% breading, 10% zucchini. The breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable.\\n\\nI had the parmesan crusted chicken with pasta, which seemed to be coated in the same breading they used on the zucchini, still too heavy and altogether flavorless. The chicken was cooked perfectly though, it just needed some spices and salt and pepper for goodness sake. The pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though. My husband was not thrilled with his pasta primavera, which was, strangely enough, very spicy (though the server did warn us about this beforehand, to her credit) and again, not much flavor and many of the veggies not cooked thoroughly.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Let me just say, if you plan to attend here as an out of state student, WATCH OUT. Classes are obnoxiously expensive, and they start sending you payment reminders weeks before the due date. Coming from CA I was shocked because CA Community Colleges give you the entire semester to make payments - not CSN and especially not if you're not a NV resident. \\nThe operations here, counseling, financial aid and registration are horrendous. No one seems to have a clue in the world what is going on. I was standing in line for 25 minutes to make an apt with an academic adviser, and was told to come back in 3 hours. I proceeded to stand in line for another 10 or 15 minutes to try and take care of my math/english test out and was told their testing was down and I had to go to Cheyenne (I CALLED ABOUT THIS ONLY 2 HOURS BEFORE AND THEY SAID IT'S FINE COME DOWN). I then went to Cheyenne and stood in line again forever then did my testing. Went back to W. Charleston for my appointment and waited 45 MINUTES, then the stupid girl at the computer said oh I forgot you were here, and sent me back. SO ANNOYING!!!!\\n I was attending both UNLV and CSN for a semester and it was a nightmare, this coming semester I'll pay the extra few thousand and solely attend UNLV, or maybe I should just go back to CA where people are normal. \\nThis school is a JOKE.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "My husband and I got married at the Phoenix Art Museum last month. This is a review of the museum as a wedding venue.\\n\\nThe Phoenix Art Museum is a fabulous place to get married. You can have your ceremony in the courtyard, in the modern art gallery (which is what we did), in the front lobby, or on the front steps by the fountain. They have an enormous hall for the reception.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n- It has that modern, not-at-all Southwest feel that my husband and I were looking for.\\n- They do a couple of weddings a year, so they know what they're doing, but they aren't simply a wedding factory. None of our guests had ever been to a wedding there, so it felt unique and special.\\n- There are so many amazing locations for individual, couple, and group photos.\\n- The event managers, Heather and Jackie, were great. They got back to me quickly when I had a question; they included my husband in the process; they were professional and friendly; they thought of the little details that helped everything flow seamlessly.\\n- If you have your ceremony in the gallery, as we did, there's a big staircase for a dramatic entrance.\\n- You can have your ceremony and reception in the same place, so your guests don't have to spend time traveling.\\n- The guys' ready room is behind a secret sliding wall. My husband got a kick out of that.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- It's $500 for the ceremony and $4,500 for the reception, so it's a little pricey.\\n- You have to use their bartender, ARTenders, so you don't have much flexibility to keep alcohol costs down. \\n- You have to use one of their preferred caterers, but they have a long list. We went with Santa Barbara Catering, and they were fabulous.\\n- The marble floor can get a little uncomfortable for dancing in heels. We put out a bunch of flip flops in a variety of colors and sizes (labeled \\\"Sandals of Relief\\\"), which were a big hit.\\n- The ladies' ready room isn't that attractive for the getting ready photos.\\n- When you're doing walk-throughs and meeting with vendors, you have to pay $10 admission, but...

        "I found this office from Zoc Doc based on the reviews and the proximity to me and was sorely disappointed. First of all, there were far too many people working at the front desk for the lack of patients visiting the office that it almost felt like vultures the second I walked in. I was bombarded with directions on what to do and questions immediately which was a bit intimidating. After all of the preliminary tests that I'm more than accustomed to after years and years of visiting eye doctors, I finally met Dr. Betsko who was less than charming. She had zero personality and was the most unwelcoming doctor I have ever met. She took about 3 minutes tops with my exam and left the room and never returned. I was then escorted out to the front where again I was bombarded with people telling me what my options were for glasses/contacts based on my insurance. I only took this job a few months ago so the insurance is new to me and they did a horrendous job of explaining it to me. I almost felt like they were trying to sell to me rather than help me and I ended up getting the least from the plan because I was so confused and so frustrated with them trying to push things on me. And to top it all off, I was told that my contacts would be ready \\\"no later than Friday\\\" when my appointment was on the previous Wednesday which was perfect considering I was leaving for my wedding less than ten days from my appointment time and wanted to be sure I had backups on my wedding day but they weren't ready until the following Wednesday. I received a text message Wednesday afternoon saying my contacts were ready for pickup but because of the millions of things to do to get ready for me to leave did not make it there until Friday. Unfortunately, no one thought to give a heads up that they would be closed the Friday before Labor Day. I would have appreciated a courtesy call saying my contacts were ready for pickup and to make sure I get them today or tomorrow since they close for a four day weekend but apparently that's too much to ask....

        "Hate that I even have to give this place one star! We went there on a Saturday night with a reservation for 11 to celebrate a birthday. Our reservation  was at 7 but we were running a little late so we called and were assured by the very nice hostess that it was not an issue.  When we arrived our table was still available but the waitress seemed bothered by the fact that we were even there. It took a half hour for her to take our order and 1.5 hours for our food to arrive.  When the food did arrive it was either over cooked or undercooked and all was ice cold! Not to mention the fact that we had to go to the bar to order drinks because our waitress would not even look in our direction for the 1.5 hours we waited for our food (bartender was great though).  When we asked to speak to the manager an obviously drunk man came to us from the bar looked at our table and walked away!  Our waitress was very rude and told us the bad service and awful food was a result of us being late for our reservation (although we were told our late arrival was no problem) but based on other reviews I see that this is just the typical service.... Or lack of service that this place provides.  We paid our bills with small tip (although I did not want to leave one at all based on our servers poor attitude) then had to eat again at the fox chapel yacht club.  We arrived at 7:30 and didn't get out until after 10!!!!! Needless to say we will never return and I will share this review with my co workers in fox chapel that look for local lunch spots! Worst experience ever!!!\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I was very excited to try this place since the closure of Maharaja left us without a good Indian buffet on the side of Pittsburgh where I live, and I wasn't crazy about the restaurant that moved in afterward.  The place was relatively deserted on a Saturday afternoon and we were soon greeted by a woman who asked us what kind of naan we wanted (onion or plain).  The food tasted fairly good but what really turned us off was the woman who worked there and her constant coughing, hacking and wheezing without even covering her mouth!  Clearly she had a nasty cold and should've stayed home that day!  I cringed every time she went back into the kitchen (we could here her back there hacking up a lung) or came over to our table.  It was so unappetizing that we hardly ate anything and got out of there as soon as possible.  I don't think I can go back there given their low standard of hygiene.  Ick, I'm cringing right now thinking of it.  On the plus side though, it did keep me from overeating.  Maybe I should have my husband cough and hack at me whenever we go to buffets from now on!\\n\\nAnyway, I hate to trash a restaurant but I had to voice my concerns.  I am very conflicted about giving the second star, but the food itself wasn't bad.  Try at your own risk!\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

I had the fried whitefish taco which was decent, but I've had much better. The margs were off though... Didn't even taste like a margarita to be honest and nobody at my table even finished half of theirs. I think there are much better Mexican places in the area.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

I probably won't go back because I can get the same quality of service for $5-8 cheaper at other places closer to home.\\n\\nQuality of service is about the same as any other Vietnamese-owned nail salon.  The one thing that they did do differently, and was nice, was the use of hot stones to massage my hands and feet.  \\n\\nWhat bothered me about this place was that they took the price list off their wall (left it laying on the floor), and I got the vibe that they were quoting people different prices depending on their mood.  (The techs spoke to one another in a foreign language to confirm how much they should charge me when I asked them how much, and the amount was slightly higher than what had been quoted by previous Yelp reviewers as well as the sign that was on the floor).  Granted, it's still cheaper than many other salons, but because I've found cheaper places, I have no reason to go back. \\n\\nThis place is decent and probably worthwhile for those who live nearby and like the convenience, but it's definitely not worth going out of the way for their services.\n\nStars:",

Someone could have told us when we first walked in they were not serving food yet.  So we left and then came back because of all the great reviews.  Sat at the bar again and shared some appetizers.  All 3 over prices and all 3 just okay.   Living close to MD i guess it as a mistake on my part to think the crab cake would be anything medicore but saw it was crab and lobster so we gave it shot.   And still disappointed.  This is what we had-Provence style lobster and crab cakes finished with basil oil and a citrus beurre blanc.

It's a burger and fries type of place to begin with, but even the soups come out with heavily oiled broth and salads loaded with Oily salad dressing (definitely ask for it on the side so you can spare yourself the grease attack)\\n\\nMy co-workers love this place so I go every now and then, but of all the different dishes I've ordered, they were all dripping buckets of grease.  Sure it's tasty, and I will always dig some greasy food, but this is really too much... Way too much.  Burgers, fries, salmon burgers, steaks, chicken sandwiches, salad, etc.  it's all pouring oil out the wazoo.  \\n\\nI got to say the service is exceptional though.  Every time I've went the service was very friendly, quick, and our food always came out fast.  Prices are reasonable too.  As for the atmosphere, I can see some people digging it but it's quite \\\"unique\\\" to say the least.  You really would never even be able to guess this was a restaurant looking at it from the outside.  There's a sign on the main road for it, but then you got to walk into the block a little bit and its in a plain colored building, hid away in a little nook.  It only gets more \\\"interesting\\\" as you go in and descend into the restaurant.  Yes, it's in a sort of a basement almost.  \\n\\nI'm not against the place by any means, and the food is OK and the service is great.  It's just far too greasy for me.  It's just a place for those that don't mind really really greasy food. My rating for this place is",

I think that's kind of unacceptable when check-out is 11am. The front desk people were not very helpful and never answered the phone when I called from the room.\\n\\nThe hotel itself is fine.

I would think this salon would attract a rather high concentration of Yelpers, or at least their moms [that was an indication of the clientele... and the price]. \\n\\nLa Pomponnee is sort of an institution; take that as you will. There are the jokes about the \\\"Virginia Manor Blonde Bob\\\" that can be easily acquired here. There are also some seriously talented stylists, some seriously talented aestheticians, and very adequate, if not especially unique, surroundings.  La Pomponnee is not a NY/SF/LA salon; it's a nice Aveda salon in Pittsburgh. The stylists are well-trained and efficient, and for what you'd pay for a junior stylist in, let's say, Boston, you get a Master stylist and tip. Deal.\\n\\nI'm now realizing, as I type this, that my mom is getting her hair done here, by Diane, who she's been seeing for about 15 years. I've had haircuts and updos from Diane, and facials from Terri [a lifesaver, or at least, facesaver]. What did I say in the beginning about La Pomponnee? Moms, and the kids who Yelp about their hair stylists.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nI'd like to start of this review by saying that Ginza of Tokyo is NOT the place to get sushi. The sushi tastes like crap, you know it, the staff knows it, don't order it here. You want sushi? Get the hell out of the midwest or go downtown to Takara. Ginza is predominately a hibachi restaurant that sells sushi to make money because unfortunately the sushi options are limited in Madison.\\n\\nNow that I've proven I'm a grade A asshole, let's get to the review. \\n\\nThe show is great. As far as I can tell the hibachi chefs know their stuff and you get to watch an onion volcano and shrimp tails be flicked into your empty water glass. The service is hit or miss as most Asian restaurants are. Yes, it's a bit pricey for the food but you aren't buying the food you're buying the experience here. Kogane shrimp is delicious for those of you who think eggs are the bees knees like I do. If I could figure out what exactly is in that egg custard they soak the shrimp in I would be ten pounds heavier. Hibachi steak is a nice choice as well.\\n\\nOverall, Ginza is a good option for a large party on a night out. Birthdays and reunions are always a good reason to come here.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "Review: I went over there to try it out for lunch today.  I haven't had a lot of wraps so I don't have much to compare it to.  I should have ordered something with meat so I had at least something to compare it to but no, as I was being adventurous I got the grilled vegetables on tomato-basil. I thought it was was pretty good, but I might have preferred one of the other offerings.  I also got the potato chips.  For some reason I had it in my head that chips made right there would be thicker.  They were however devoid of any staleness you can get with bagged chips.  I will be back again to try something else.\\n\\nOn the way over there I was thinking this would be better on a Saturday because it is about 20 minutes in traffic each way from work.  Well, the website doesn't show it yet but they are now open Saturdays!\\n\\nTwo pleasant guys were working behind the counter and had several orders going at once even though I was the only one there.  I was greeted by the cook as soon as I walked in and shortly thereafter the person filling orders and such took my order.  The delivery driver was in and out a couple of times while I was there.   Being a nice day out I sat at the outside tables, there was just enough breeze and no sun on the North side of the building to make it feel much cooler than it really was.  If I had been smart I would have pulled a table and chair out in the sun like another person did while I was eating.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nOh, the horror, the horror..............\\n\\nOkay not really. More of a disappointment and a bummer.\\n\\nIn a nutshell- apathetic General Manager acting as expeditor sent out food that should not have gone out to clients. He should have looked at it first- nothing major, a baked potato cut down the middle with a large black \\\"tumor\\\" of rot hidden beneath the skin at one end. Could happen to anyone at home, I didn't want a free meal, but I thought that as expeditor he should be more alert.  His response was no response until he waited on me at the register, where his comeback to the issue was \\\"it was an eye.\\\"  No, it was not a potato eye- they are external root sprouts and not black- and even so, what restaurant serves potatoes without trimming eyes?  He proceeded to grow increasingly more condescending, apathetic, and overtly rude albeit being rude using \\\"kind\\\" words- the dismissive \\\"thanks for coming and you have a nice day\\\" said in a tone of voice that essentially translates to \\\"F off.\\\"  He just would not take ownership for the oversight, and obviously is not a person to learn from his mistakes. He's in the wrong business.  I have had salads served to me with the huge copper staples from the lettuce crate in my salad and expected nothing but for the prep cook in the pantry to use more diligence when washing and chopping lettuce. I didn't even want an apology, just a simple acknowledgment that there was an oversight that needed to be more closely heeded before sending food out from the line. All I got was attitude from a young man whose age I double, but who believes that he knows much more than I do and whose authority is not to be challenged. \\n\\nMy server Emmy was great, she got a 30% tip from me. That manager netted a phone call to Cracker Barrel customer service. I've eaten at Cracker Barrels all over the USA for 21 years now, and have never been addressed or treated so rudely as my experience today.  Hopefully corporate in Lebanon, TN will sort this fellow out.\n\nReview rating:",

I know from past experiences that what was causing that was the use of MSG.  Again I really like this place, I wish they would stop using MSG and I would return in a heart beat. I know that they are not the only restaurant that uses MSG. But I also avoid other restaurants that use this artificial food contaminent.

I went with my Dad, who was in town for the day. Bonus points for having a few plasmas playing the ballgame, but not too many. Classy and understated all the way. New Mexico themed fare, whatever that is. It is basically a seafood/steakhouse with a bit of extra spicy kick to everything. I went with the Pasta and Grill, which consisted of a small medallion of steak, some chicken (with the added kick) and swordfish with a spicy chutney over the top. Served over beans and rice, with half the plate offering up some pretty damned tasty penne. Went great with a glass of wine, and not too much damage on the wallet. We got out of there for $60 plus a tip. One of my new favorites. Interesting note; my Dad said if I didn't pull him in here, he would have \\\"driven right by the place and not even knew it was there\\\".

They come with various combinations of beef, pork, ginger, scallions, and two kinds of dumplings (wonton or gyoza), a big pile of stringy noodles (think Chinese angel hair pasta), and broth.  One soup with an appetizer or two can feed a couple people, but we've been known to order one soup per person in response to strong Wah Kee cravings.  The menu is huge, but I've not strayed from the Tong Mein much at all.  It's dang good.  Not sure if I would order for regular junk Chinese food, but definitely worth it for the soup.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

For starters the chairs were extremely comfortable, making all of the other salons I've visited in the past months seem like they got their chairs at a garage sale.   So my neck, back and butt are happy, I have my tea in hand and as I stick my feet in the water which was set at perfect temperature, I can tell this is going to be good! Normally when it comes to clipping and filing my toe nails it's painful, but Alexis did a great job taking her time I could barley feel it.  I decided to go with the deluxe pedicure for only $5 more and it was so worth it!  Started with a sugar scrub which felt amazing, then moved to the lotion massage, and to top it off a mud mask with bags and a hot towel which my feet soaked in for about 7 minutes.  When she took off the hot towel and the bags from each foot, my feet felt so refreshed!! The minty cool feeling stayed in tact for almost 4 hours and I couldn't have been happier.  Alexis really did take her time and it was nice to feel like she was honestly doing her best for my satisfaction as a customer.  Smart girl! I'll be back to see her and I can imagine she has quite the loyal clientele.  Apparently this salon has been around for 10 years and I can see why!

In fact my bullmastiff actually attacked her which he's never done to anybody before. There's something about her that he just didn't like.  Also she doesn't provide the confidence in her treatments that Dr. Casper did. She always seems unsure and since vet visits are so expensive it's not the best idea to go with a dr. that you feel is experimenting with treatments.  \\n\\nSo we've decided to move on to another vet office in hopes of finding a better match.\\nBonus this new vet accepts my pet insurance which will save us a lot of money each year.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "This past Saturday me and my room mate decided to check this place out due to the fact that it was lunch time and we were in the area. I have heard their commercials before and I have been wanting to check the place out. I am a huge fan of Chipotle and due to everyone's reviews that this restaurant is of a similar concept, it was my idea to go there. \\n\\nOnce there, there were only two young girls behind the counter, no one else in the restaurant. Because I had never been there, I was looking over their menu. The girl however, seemed in a rush to get my order done so she could go back to talking to her co worker. As I was going through the line I was asking for recommendations on what she thought went best together but again, she seemed bother to help me and had a bad attitude. She kept making comments on the fact they didn't charge extra for guacamole and I figured it was their job to sell you on that. Also, the food behind the counter seemed like it was sitting there all day and did not look appetizing at all. There was trash on the floor of the restaurant and there was even chairs on top of the tables. For a restaurant that didn't seem busy at all I would expect cleanliness. \\n\\nI ended up paying $11.00 for a bowl that seemed smaller than the bowls at chipotle that I would normally spend $9.00 for even with the extra guacamole. The worst part of my experience is that both  my room mate and I ended up getting food poisoning even though we ordered two completely different things. I literally rushed home to throw up because their food was so heavy on me. I automatically knew that it was from there because I had not eaten anything all day before that. \\n\\nI definitely do not recommend this place at all. I am going to stick with Chipotle all the way. My first experience with this restaurant will be the only one. Their  staff need to change their attitude as well. My rating for this place is",

        "Review: Came here for Valentine's Day and this place was packed. My boyfriend is such a sweetheart because I love seafood and he doesn't. We didn't have reservations so we put our name down and sat at the bar to enjoy their happy hour specials. \\n\\nI ordered 2 oysters, the ginger lime shrimp and a glass of their HH Chardonnay. I was pleasantly surprised with their Chardonnay. It was pretty good. Because they were busy and backed up our server, who was also cooking at the bar grill, gave me an extra oyster. Yay! They were large and yummy. But the best appetizer was the ginger lime prawns. They were so good and although I am not a fan of coleslaw I ate every bit of the coleslaw that came with it. \\n\\nI agree with the other reviews that some parts of this restaurant are just really really bright. Not wanting to chance getting stuck under the heat lamps we found some cozy seats in the bar area and decided to eat there instead. I ordered the special that night, which was a Caesar salad, half a lobster and prawns with 2 sides and 3 chocolate strawberries for dessert. I think it was just over $31 for that special. It was pretty good. I tend to like my lobster steamed and not grilled, but it wasn't bad. Our waitress was very attentive throughout the night and it was a nice touch that they gave all the ladies there a single rose before you left.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "I haven't been to Harper's in YEARS!  I was a little reluctant when some friends suggested Harper's but I decided to go with the flow and unfortunately, ended up pretty disappointed.  \\n\\nThey do a lot right so I don't want to totally bash them but the quality of food is just not up to par.  I was super hungry when we arrived so that should have benefited good old Harpers but apparently it was mind over matter and I have a clear picture of everything I tasted.\\n\\nQuick Summary:\\n\\nThe dipping trio:\\nSalsa tasted like it came straight out of a jar...Harris Teeter or no...food lion brand.\\nPimento Cheese--tasted like mustard with chunks of cheese in it\\nArtichoke and spinach dip--dry and flaky..had decent flavor but not creamy\\n\\nThe chips were thin and greasy and mostly small pieces.  \\n\\nI ordered the Chicken Salad with some type of ginger soy dressing.  It was just ok.  The chicken looked like it had been shrunk...it was pretty dry.  It was basically like what you would get in a frozen fajita meal.  You know how the chicken is small, salty and fatty?  The lettuce was chopped but dry and looked like it came straight out of a bag.  The cucumbers, red peppers and onions that were supposed to be in the salad must have been playing hide n seek.  I think I had one piece of each.\\n\\nOthers are my table tried another steak salad, blackened chicken pasta and the burger.  Everyone pretty much had the same response...\\\"just ok.\\\"  In fact, my friend tried to justify her reasoning for choosing Harper's by saying, \\\"wow, I haven't been here in so long.  I remembered it being so good as a kid so I thought it would be fun to try it again.\\\"  Um, is that your way of apologizing?\\n\\n\\nThe service was decent but our waitress clearly had a bad attitude.  She didn't smile once.  Half of the food for our table came out about 10 minutes before the other half so the manager offered us a free dessert.  I thought that was super classy because we didn't even have to bring it to their attention.  I can't complain about something that... My rating for this place is",

        "Review: I don't know folks. I see a lot of good reviews of this place here on Yelp but my experience at this restaurant was just awful! This is your typical mom and pop place. Normally these types of places are great. Not so with this one. We walked in and were seated promptly. We had a couple of questions about the menu and our food server could not answer any of them. One of the questions was \\\"do you have margaritas\\\"? She was so clueless she didn't even know if they served margaritas or not!!! Every question we asked she kept having to run into the kitchen to have answered. Finally an older lady had to come out and help her. The older lady told us our food server had only been there a week. You're there a week and don't know what type of drinks you serve among other things? The items we ordered were guacamole cheese crisp, shredded beef burrito enchilada style (red sauce) and machaca burrito with green sauce. The cheese crisp was cold and the tortilla they used had the consistency of pop tarts. Hard, greasy, horrible. It was the worst cheese crisp I've ever had. The shredded beef burrito was only filled about a quarter of the way and the beef was extremely dry and flavorless.  It makes me nauseous thinking about it it was that bad.  The machaca burrito was made using ground beef with spices. Not your typical machaca. We thought we were given an incorrect order but the food server advised us this is how they make their machaca. It is dried then ground. I would not visit here again. I've eaten at better Taco Bells.   Do not eat at this restaurant.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

They have batting cages that you can use while you wait for your next game. I'm not sure how much these were but I couldn't imagine them being very expensive. The only issue I had was their lack of first aid. I was pretty scraped up from a couple rough slides and I had nothing to cover my injuries. I would highly recommend bringing some first aid equipment if you plan on playing here. Also, the umpires were a little, uh, interesting is a good term.

        "Review: So.  Many.  TVs.  If you want to watch a game (or many games all at once), this is the place.  Alas, my review will solely be for the ambience at this point, as I was too engrossed in the nail-biter of a game to eat more than a few pieces of broccoli from the vegetable tray.\\n\\nI recently visited Santisi Brothers to catch the U of A vs. Washington basketball game (Go Cats!) and was simply amazed by the number of flashing screens upon walking in.  A row of large flatscreens run along the walls with smaller screens above them.  When they switched all the big screens to the U of A game, it was magical.  My friend and I were happy to find some other Wildcats (tough to come by in ASU/enemy territory) to form our own mini-McKale.  Something that I noticed that is extremely important for ideal television viewing in this scenario is the layout of the tables.

        "I've been to Moto several times as it's right down the street from me, and it's my go-to when I want average sushi and a Happy Hour drink. The servers are friendly and the menu is really varied; I always question establishments that serve such a stark variation in cuisine, but this place manages to competently serve everything from sushi to stir frys to burgers and sweet potato fries. \\n\\nI use the term \\\"competently\\\" because it's by no means great food. The sushi is average, at best, but I come back because they have a good happy hour and the ambiance is way better than at your average Japanese restaurant. This place is obviously not authentic Japanese food as you quickly learn from taking a glance at their amusing menu, but I don't mind a little lack of authenticity for the sake of a more comfortable and fun environment. \\n\\nMy one significant gripe is that they market themselves as a sushi restaurant but the menu appears to be lacking in the most basic rolls; I usually try to order off-menu standards when I'm there like a simple tuna or yellowtail roll and they're usually accommodating. I asked for a regular salmon roll once though, and was told that they only have the smoked salmon that comes in the Philly Roll. A sushi restaurant that doesn't carry raw salmon?! You've got to be kidding me, I hope that my server was just uninformed because that's pretty inexcusable otherwise. \\n\\nI wouldn't suggest coming here for sushi except during Happy Hour, because their sushi isn't very good and so it's overpriced if you go during regular times.\nSo I would like to give it",

It was way over priced for the condition of the room and area. The carpet was filthy,  the comforter had cigarette burns in it, and I felt unconfortable and unsafe the whole time we were there. \\n When we arrived it appeared someone was moving out, at first we thought we were at the wrong place because this place looks like a rundown apartment building. And yes these people lived there because they moved a whole uhaul truck out and did it all night long. The place is full of druggies as well,  we found some guy looking in every car window checking for unlocked doors and when my husband confronted him he said he was just looking for a cigarette,  then told my husband to have a nice day, ha. This guy was so high and hung around the hotel all day.\\n The guyat the front was nice and helpful, but that would be the only good thing about this place. \\n Definitely don't stay here especially with children.\n\nReview rating:",

        "For a place open 24 hours it was a welcome site. Remembering a couple of years ago staying at the Hilton Garden Inn that was across from this place. We had arrived to late to find some decent place in Scottsdale and even the hotel seemed like it wouldn't do. \\n\\nWe arrived and sat down at the counter looking over the menu. It was front and back and there was a variety of items to eat. It was strange eating breakfast at night, but then again there's always Denny's right? Well we sat down and started to stare at the menu trying to decide. \\n\\nI ended up ordering a grill chicken sandwich and that being the only thing I ate as a true meal it was decent. I did want to try the waffles to compare it to Country Waffles, but I didn't want to feel really full. \\n\\nIt was decent and made to order which was nice. However, sitting where I was sitting I knew most of the items on the menu were prepared before hand. The salads were done and placed into bowls ready to be served on a plate. The orange juice was in a machine that keeps running to make sure it's not sitting still was scary. It looked like one of those machines you see at Orange Julius. The orange juice was in buckets ready to be refilled. \\n\\nOverall, I thought it was a little creepy and disturbing in the restaurant. If I had a choice I'd make sure that the airlines would have informed us that the luggage was already set a side. I wished that we'd got back into town to eat at a real restaurant before everything closed. Good for a snack, but not a place I'd want to return to unless desperate. My rating for this place is",

We were crammed into a little table the four of us elbow to elbow with the diners seated on both sides. \\nThis already has put me in a bad mood.I never did well in Europe sharing my table with stranger and in the U.S it irks me even more \\nIt took forever to get our drinks of simply water and soda. \\nWe at last caught our waitresses eye and was told should would take care of us she guessed.....? What the heck she was the same waitress who took the drink order and was delivering the food next to us. \\nWhen Ms.Wiffty finally brought our long awaited food it is totally the wrong order.We even considered asking if we could just keep it because we had waited so long, but no off she went to leave us for another 20 minutes. \\nWhat we got at long last was so disappointing. \\nIt tasted no better than Taco Bell anywhere in America.Think nacho grande with a side of Guacamole. First and last visit.We did notice on the bill she gave us the wrong check .It was for half the amount of food we ordered and was probably some poor guys check.We waved her over .Her reply was just leave the money on the table I'll come by and get it later................ \\nSo we did.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Crap!  I can't believe that I missed a \\\"First to Review\\\" by just a matter of weeks.  Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining star and a \\\"must\\\" for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  Years ago, when I worked on the Northside for Heinz, I spent many a rowdy Friday night here in the basement with factory workers.  \\n\\nWhat's there to say?  It's a Northside institution and always has a mixed crowd that is super cool and friendly.  The bartenders are friendly and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!  I love the decor here, dark wood paneling with lots of stained glass, and the downstairs bar is where the naughty people hang.  Jukebox and room for dancing.  The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  The German nachos are always worth ordering, and they are smothered with Gouda cheese.  The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent treat.  And for those seeking the real Deutsch culinary experience, they have a large variety of sausages and schnitzels.  So it's a sausage factory in more ways than one.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nWe've never eaten breakfast or lunch here, and given the multiple bad reviews regarding wedding cakes, I'd never order one here.  Thank goodness I'm not in the market for a wedding cake!  I was however, in the market for a custom birthday cake so I did end up ordering one from here.  The lady who took my order was kind of standoffish, so I really had to turn up the charm to warm her up.  Once we got past that awkwardness she was much less caustic, and we even ended up buying goodies from the case after ordering the cake.  \\n\\nFast forward one week when we came to pick up the cake, and they had it ready and waiting for us at the time we specified.  When a different lady brought the cake out, it was in a box, so we only saw the top of it, and we mistakenly took that at face value.  Our error was not checking the writing we had ordered that went on the side of the cake as opposed to the traditional top side.  When we got home we realized the birthday cake had the recipient's name spelled wrong.  Yikes!  \\n\\nWe jokingly played off the spelling error, because we just didn't have time to take it back and ask that it be fixed.  Though, I wonder what their response would have been. \\n\\nThe taste of the cake was average.  No one seemed incredibly amazed by it.  I'm not entirely sure I would get another one from here again.\n\nReview rating:",

More like what you would expect from flos diner. \\nSeated and waited WAY too long for menus and drinks to order. \\nMaybe I am too critical but I expect my water to be refilled without asking, to be asked - when my beer is empty - if I would like another, be checked on during appetizers and the meal as to if we are enjoying the meal and is everything good. \\nWith all that being said and the food being adequate there are many other choices with better pizza and service - which may be why the place was 2/3 empty.

        "Saturday, 6/18/2011 around 8pm\\n\\nAtmosphere: Dark, intimate seating in a large space. You are in your own world at your table with other tables you can see, but cannot hear well. Good for groups and couples alike. \\n\\nService: Friendly, attentive, and well-informed waitstaff. They know what is and what is not vegetarian and they have great recommendations for drinks, food, etc.\\n\\nThe drinks: I ordered the coconut margarita, which was flavorful and not-too-sweet. Nice, smooth house tequila; not the best booze, but certainly not the worst. Each table also has a pitcher of ice water, so you can pour your own water. Great for when you bite into something spicy and you then drain your glass of water and your date's glass of water. \\n\\nThe food: Chips and salsa while you peruse the menu with an extra thing of hot salsa, so you can customize your spiciness. We ordered the chile con queso dip, el numero nueve (cheese enchilada, shredded beef taco, chile relleno, and rice), and an a la carte bean tostadas.\\n\\nThe queso is definitely not a Tex-Mex queso. A fellow Yelper compared it to the quesos of Austin, TX. Not even the slightest bit true. Nando's queso is a good queso, but it is watery when it first comes out. The chips served with the queso are puffy and great. Don't get me wrong, I will return to Nando's for the queso.\\n\\nThe bean tostadas was huge, great, and cheap. Lots of guacamole on it. Yum.\\n\\nThe nueve combo was HUGE, covered in cheese, and very, very hot. The shredded beef taco was a great suggestion from our server! My date ended up taking 2/3 of his meal home because he couldn't finish it. \\n\\nOverall, this is a solid Tex-Mex restaurant. Large (HUGE) portions, good drinks, queso (!!!!), and a great a la carte menu where you can order a ton of food for about $5 each. Oh, and lots of vegetarian options with good (meaty and cheesy) food for meat-loving dates.\nSo I would like to give it",

Now was my chance as I needed a last minute Christmas present for my grandma. \\n\\nThe place is larger than you think from the outside. They actually have a whole outdoor area that's covered for the winter with many different plants I couldn't identify. I thought the owner was super duper sweet and just really energetic. Her and another staff member helped me pick out a plant that was in a vase, not in a pot, and looked really cool and modern. I loved it and had a fleeting thought to pick one up myself... if I wouldn't kill it (which I probably would!). \\n\\nI had commented about a table full of vases filled with what looked like works of art. They turned out to be flower displays for hotels, but man where they cool. If I was doing an event or having a wedding, that's exactly what I would have wanted. They just looked really modern but creative. \\n\\nThey also have some winged friends you can say hi to, including one screaming one in the back that you can't see. Kinda creepy, but I guess that comes with a unique shop! I will absolutely be back to pick up items for people and consider them for any events I have coming up.\n\nStars:",

I've been traveling so much lately, that I'm way overdue in writing this review of Phoenix Sky Harbor. I admit, it's a tough one to write though... your experience relies 100% on the airline you're flying, what terminal you're at, and TSA / security.  Of course, it's always nicer when you fly first class or club member level, as you typically get to avoid major lines.\\n\\nLuckily, I live only about 20 minutes from Phoenix Sky Harbor aka PHX.  My favorite terminal is terminal four; it's the newest, easiest to drop-off / pick-up from, it has the most dining options, etc... \\n\\nI find the staff at the airport to be friendly overall.  It is easy to navigate through, and we've got clean restrooms and free wifi too (if you're lucky enough to get it to work for you); but there's nothing else that stands out about this airport to make it so unique.  (No really local businesses with a presence in the airport, no extraordinary food vendors, no rocking chairs, etc... and for that reason, I'm giving it a three star rating - A-OK indeed!   \\n\\nI'll see you again real soon, PHX.

Today Jen and I both ordered the 10oz prime rib rare with salad. She had mixed veggies and I had garlic mash and a skewer of grilled shrimp.We ordered the Shrimp Cargot for a starter. It was amazing. Plump shrimp drowning in cheese and garlic butter with two sides of toasted French rolls. \\n\\nThe prime rib and mashed potatoes were both way over-seasoned. Which is too bad cause the prime rib was sooo tender. Unfortunately it was drown in Rosemary that not even the au jus could wash off. The garlic mash was riddled with black pepper so I could only eat a few bites. I kept envisioning Gordon Ramsey standing in front of the cooks shaking his head saying \\\"That's too bad,\\\" with a disappointed look on his face. Not so disappointing that I didn't eat all of the prime. \\n\\nEnding on an up note, Jen had Blackstone Merlot which went very well with our meal and the salads came with a very delicious croissant. So delightfully sweet and fresh. Amazing and such a nice surprise. Veggies were veggies. \\n\\nI reiterate the service was very good and the food was prepared to perfection other than the seasoning so I am chalking it up to bad luck.

        "The food is mediocre, the decor is a bit more modern than your typical joint. Hubby ordered the special (dac biet) for $7.25 and I ordered a large bowl of the raw beef with tendon also for $7.25. We also ordered the plain noodle with broth for $5.00, spring rolls and egg rolls for the children.The bowls came full of broth and tender meat, but a disportionate amount of soggy noodles. I told my server that hubby and my bowl did not have enough noodles and they said that's how it's served. So we each order another serving of noodles for $3.00. Spring rolls were puny...really puny for $5.00, about 30% smaller than what you would get in a typical food joint. The egg rolls were super greasy, so greasy I had to roll them into the napkins before I served them to my children. I asked for hot tea, the hot tea never came, but the ice water that I never ordered arrived. The bill came out to be $38 and some change with tip included. (You don't get a choice.) I voiced my disatisfaction with another server who I thought was a manager and then the owner. They just said sorry and did nothing to ameliorate the situation. Overall, the food is ok, but it's expensive considering Vegas is the most wasteful place on earth with all the buffets. If you're really craving for Pho, then it will meet your basic needs, but I would recommend you pass and just go to your local favorite joint. My rating for this place is",

        "Review text:\nI've been to Baby Kay's three times. The first time was probably about eight years ago, and I honestly can't remember what I ate or any details so it can essentially be ignored. The most recent visits were about a month apart and the last was today. The food is okay, but extremely overpriced and underflavored. The red beans and \\\"rice\\\" dish, w/andouille for an extra $1, is essentially a plate of beans with about two tablespoons' worth of white rice, plus about an ounce of their green olive coleslaw. Ok, it -was- reasonably spicy but should have been no more than about six bucks because what it really equated to was an appetizer as far as I'm concerned, and the amount of beans grossly outweighed the amount of rice. Their special today was 8 fried shrimp with dirty rice crawfish etouffee and one side. I got the coleslaw again. The amount of food, for $14, was pitiful - a half serving, essentially. And this time the flavor was just totally lacking. The full crawfish etouffee dish price is $19 which is murderously expensive and as I discovered today it just doesn't have much flavour. The dirty rice had what appeared to be minced beef in it and was light on the pepper. Even the garlic bread wasn't any better than I could have made myself with a cheap baguette from Fry's, butter and some chopped fresh garlic. I know everyone's been fapping on about authentic flavour here, but if that's what this is then I much prefer Pappadeaux. Save your money - there's no value to be had in this restaurant.\\n\\nEdit 20130902: Tonight my wife made a simple meal of a packet of store-bought Tony Chachere jambalaya with some chopped up polska kielbasa sausage in it. It was delicious. Taste buds still working - check.\n\nReview rating:",

        "This is an overdue review for one of the worst experiences ever in Vegas!\\n\\nSo a pack of us are in Sin City for \\\"Frozen Fury\\\" to watch the Kings play Colorado.  Emotions were riding high since the Kings won and was going to be my buddy's first time at a Strip Club!\\n\\nWe stroll in grab seats and enjoy the festivities.  Hot chicks everywhere so I slowly drift off into Candyland...ahhhhhh.  Little did I know that the wolves were slowly working on one young pup.  A dancer came over and whispered into the \\\"Pup\\\" ears and off he went to the VIP room.\\n\\n3-6-8 Songs later...I ask...\\\"Where's Puperoni\\\".  Of course, the others in the pack ignored me.   Songs continue....chi chis are bouncing.....\\\" Hey C...where is your boy??\\\".  C gets up and heads to the VIP room.  Bouncer stops him from entering and tells him he cant go in.  By then, our group heads to see what's up.\\n\\nAt some point, the Dancer was able to get the \\\"Pup's\\\" credit card and racked up a bill for $990 and took him for $170 in cash.  WTF!  Okay, now maybe it was at least 10 songs with full nudity, but how do rack up $1000 for lap dances???  BullSh*t!\\n\\nMy buddy's pup signed the credit card receipt so there was nothing to contest except that our young apprentice got taken.  Little \\\"Sparky\\\" has a crappy job making $9 an hour, so this $1000+ lesson should be around for quite a while.  \\n\\nI had a great time, venue was cool but do the \\\"Little Darlings\\\" at Little Darlings have to feed on the young.  I was also taught that \\\"you get more bees with honey\\\".  I guess not.  \\n\\nNot sure if I would ever go back.  If you provide a wild and exciting time, the boys will come, however, this was all shady.  Definitely rubbed me the wrong way.  You only get one star cause I can't give you less...but then again you already took what you could.\\n\\nAdvice, watch your young or leave the pups at home.  There are tons of other places to go in Vegas.  Next time, I will recommend to stay in CA and call up the girls from Ashley Entertainment.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Strategically situated across from the Food Court, we sometimes walk past this place as we make our way to the other side of the shopping center. Usually we don't pay it any attention. But recently we got a chunk of fudge here- chocolate peanut butter. It's weighed individually. The pieces are huge! I think our block was around $7.00. I'm not a chocoholic like my husband, but I still rather enjoyed it- creamy and rich. (FYI, I love the chocolate and peanut butter combination. It's my favorite.) The looks on people passing us while walking and eating bites of the scrumptious fudge, was pretty funny; y'know that they wanted some fudge, too! It was a nice indulgence- you gotta treat yourself sometimes, right?\\n\\nThe store itself seems small from its appearance on the outside. But once inside you will see that there is seating on both sides of the store. There is such a large variety of different kinds of fudge. They are generously cut and individually weighed. Also serves other sweets and drinks. Even towards the end of the night, the cashier was pleasant and friendly.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I have always been a fan of Macayo's, but after stopping by for dinner last night, I will probably not be visiting this location again.\\n\\nFirst off, when pulling into their parking lot, there is a very visible sign notifying customers that Macayo's is not responsible for any items stolen from customer's cars. Not so good. If you are openly warning me that break-ins are frequent in your parking lot, why should I eat here if there is a safer option somewhere else?\\n\\nOn the night I visited this location, four of us had stopped by to grab dinner before a concert. When we asked for a table, we were offered seats at the bar. No big deal - except that after we walked around the corner, we quickly learned that the bar was completely full. Back to the hostess station.\\n\\nWe are now walked back to another portion of the restaurant that is almost completely empty. Huh. In any case, our server promptly brought us drinks and kept the chips & salsa coming until my brother arrived.\\n\\nOne of my favorite entrees is the Baja Chimi, but I have to tell you that I was really disappointed with the one that I ate here. I chose shredded beef, but apparently at this location that includes gristle & fat that I don't normally receive at the other Macayo's locations. I'm not sure what the issue was here, but at least three times I bit into meat that was inedible.\\n\\nOur server was very attentive and kept things moving, so kudos to him for doing an excellent job. Hostess station...not sure what was going on there. As customers were leaving, they never even thanked them for stopping by - or even wished anyone a good evening. In fact, the girls in the front appeared to be spending more time talking to each other than to customers. This is really not THAT big of a deal to me, but if it were my restaurant, I would probably extend myself a little more to thank my customers for choosing me over another establishment.\\n\\nIf you do decide to visit this Macayo's location before seeing a concert at the nearby Pavillion, plan on arriving there...\nSo I would like to give it",

I favorite thing is that it cooks that good old world Italian food.  I lived in Kansas City where there is a good amount of Italians there and being in Arizona that food seems hard to find.  Santisit's has that good Italian family food packaged in a sports bar and not the traditional Italian family restaurant.  Kudos for that now on to the next.  \\n\\nI visited this place twice over the last week and have received bad service and got insulted on the second visit.  On 07/19 with my fiancee.  We ordered a antipasto salad and a stromboli.  We arrived at 3pm and did not receive our order until 3:45.  I believe the only reason we received that because they over heard the conversation that I was going to leave if the food was not out by 3:45.  I was surprised it took so long to bring the food out and especially a salad.  They could have just brought that out first since that was so simple to make.  We were out on Lake Pleasant that day out in the hot sun for about 4 hours and we grew an appetite.  However, we received the food and it was great.  \\n\\nI visited this place again on 07/23 for happy hour after doing some after hours work and I felt really insulted by the bartender that day and I didn't finish my food that day.  I arrived at there around 5:30pm and order a Michelob Ultra and a stromboli again.  Keep in mind that I am a heavyset guy and my bartender was a skinny 130lbs older lady probably around in her 50's.  She brings my order and looks at the plate and makes a remark saying, \\\"That would last me about 3 days\\\".  I did not understand why she said that but I paid it no mind until I was ready to go.  I only ate half of the plate and when I asked her to package my plate she makes another remark, \\\"I'm suprised you didn't eat the whole thing\\\".  I left the place shocked and insulted.

The check in went fine and because they obviously had lots of cars and no customers (I was the only one at the desk) the agent offered me a Mercedes C Class for my one day of rental.  I don't normally drive Mercedes but took her up on the offer,  The car had 20,000 miles and I drove it less than 100 miles.  On my way back to the rental agency, the GPS System stopped working which was difficult but much more challenging was the signal lights and hazard lights starting blinking without a way to make them stop.  I'm a very experienced driver but this was unbelievable.  It took me 1.5 hours to drive to the agency when it should have only taken me 1/2 hour.  When I turned the car in, I asked to see a manager.  The agent went down the row and talked to some women who wouldn't come and talk to me.  Instead, the agent told me that he could drop $15.00 off my bill.  I was shocked.  I wanted to talk to the manager to explain how dangerous it was to drive that particular car and let her know my experience.  She wasn't interested.  Not only was the car a disaster but I paid much more for the Hertz vehicle than many of my co-attendees at the conference.\\nLesson learned:  NEVER RENT FROM HERTZ\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Heritage Square earns a fourth star in my book for being a historical landmark in Phoenix. But what exactly lives in Heritage Square? Let me tell you! Here, the Arizona Science Center, famous Pizzeria Bianco and Nobuou at Teeter House call this humble square home.

I also like how Heritage Square hosts a variety of festivals throughout the year. I wish they did more and took more advantage of the space, but the ones they do are nice.  \\n\\nWhat I like most about Heritage Square is the ambiance in the late afternoon as the sun is starting to set and the weather is breezy but warm. As I walk through, I look up and see the city surrounding me and it makes me appreciate Downtown Phoenix. Plus the architecture of the Science Center along with the historical buildings housing the restaurants and other museums add to the character of the square.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

She'd been talking about the wings at this place for a whole week since she first tried them so we decided to go so I could check it out too.  The building doesn't look like much from the outside and it'd be easy to miss so make sure you're looking closely!\\n\\nIt's a lot bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside which I was happy about because no one likes a cramped eating space.  We were greeted and seated right away which is always nice and the hostess was friendly.  Our server arrived quickly as well and was also pleasant.  My friend decided on the Honey Hot boneless wings and I went with Medium, we also wanted to try out the pizza so we split a 10\\\" Pepperoni.\\n\\nThe food came out pretty fast which was good because we were hungry.  The wings were a good size, perfectly crispy with the right amount of sauce and they had a great flavor.  The pizza was delicious as well.  We polished off the whole thing and I'm justifying it by telling myself it was small so it's okay.  My only tiny little pet peeve (and this is going to make me sound like a diva...) is that the water tasted like unfiltered tap water.  I hate to bring that up but Arizona water does have it's own special \\\"flavor\\\" and it just wasn't great.  With the exception of that though I loved everything about this place and I will certainly be back soon.\n\nStars:",

        "Review text:\nIt was like taking a trip back in time when I walked in. The decor used now is the same as back in the early 90's that I grew up with (though a bit faded). Somehow, I like that it hasn't changed. After living in California for 8 years, it was nice to come back to something VERY familiar.\\n\\nThe cashiers are friendly enough. Last week she took my order, and said thank you, with a smile, at the end. The male cashier, tonight, was fine too, I don't have high expectations at a fast food joint. As long as you don't spit in my food, we're cool.\\n\\nThe food is good if you are looking for a good cheap meal that doesn't contain a burger and fries. It definitely isn't authentic Japanese food. (Of course, if you think Panda Express is authentic Chinese food, or if you like to douse your rice in soy sauce, this is the real ish.) \\n\\nI highly recommend the veggie egg rolls. They are so good I could literally eat them every day. I don't know what's in them, but they are amazing.\\n\\nThe house chicken is great if you're dining in as it will become a bit soggy if you take it to go. The steam from the rice softens the crispy exterior quite a bit. It's a little bit sweet, and a little bit sour - but it isn't like sweet and sour chicken. It has little bits of pickled carrots and cucumbers (I think) mixed in and some green onions thrown on top. \\n\\nThe teriyaki chicken is great if you're dining in or taking out. If you don't like a lot of sauce on your Teriyaki, ask for it on the side. They really lay on the sauce.\\n\\nThe fortune cookies are hit or miss depending on who is working. Usually the girl cashiers are a bit more generous (or maybe I'm just that cute.)\n\nReview rating:",

Little disappointed w/their Spicy tuna - I didn't feel any degree of warmth on those.  In general, I felt that their seafood wasn't the freshest, but I realize that this is challenging as we're in the middle of the Sonoran Desert. Prices were a tad high also.\\n\\nBest I had was their Seaweed Salad - so yummy! Spices were perfect!\\n\\nTheir ambience was rather sub-par, IMO. You walk in and it's a tiny little waiting room w/chairs that scream that they're from 1988. Additionally, they had a wall of framed photos of past patrons w/their autograph? Hmm - looked very dated and sorta junky/cluttered. Some photos were faded - this makes me scared to eat their food... \\nThey could do a makeover and do like a modern/contemporary and Asian hybrid look.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

The woman at the desk was very friendly and helpful. This is our first child so we had no idea what we were doing! After being signed up, we were provided with a scanner, a map of the store and a checklist for must have items. The store is set up in lettered sections which makes it easy to find what you're looking for in such a large store. There is always a staff member around the corner that is eager to answer any questions you may have. \\nThey also made it very easy to return things that we received, even without a receipt! They just loaded the value onto a gift card. Also, if you make your registry here... after your shower they will give you 15% off everything that is still on your registry!  They also have a great rewards program and you get coupons printed on your receipt every time you shop here!\\nThe reason I give 4 stars is because they are a little pricey...

The Pho and various soup dishes are great and they don't skimp on all the goodies to go with, providing large plates of Thai basil, bean sprouts, peppers, etc. The rice dishes are good too. I especially like the beef with lemongrass rice dish. The pork and shrimp rolls are also excellent and very big - almost a meal on their own. The best thing about this restaurant (besides its very authentic and yummy food and quick - never a wait - service) is that it is cheap, cheap, cheap.

        "Review text:\nCalifornia Pizza Kitchen has always been one of those places that everyone can agree on. The menu is big enough where there is something for everyone and usually everyone walks away happy. Lately though, the quality of the food as gone way down. \\n\\nBefore I went vegetarian I used to always get the chicken waldorf salad and it was always so good. I love the blue cheese and the candied walnuts. They were addicting. Since I've become vegetarian I settled on the hummus appetizer, grilled vegetable salad, and the wild mushroom pizza. Recently though, they have completed revamped the menu, adding new items, taking old favorites off. For some places, menu changes mean new and exciting food opportunities and makes the visit to that place even better. Not for CPK. \\n\\nRecently, since beginning to use yelp, I have wanted to try new places and veer away from old favorites or places that I am used to. However, I tend to have friends and family members who are food-borists... Ya I just invented a new word. A food-borist is someone who never wants to try anything new, and will eat at the same place and order the same exact thing all of the time. My friends are this way. It never fails. Any time one of them has a birthday I get an invitation to eat at CPK and every time I groan. Even before I swore off CPK forever, I was getting extremely tired of it. The second to the last time I went was for my birthday with some friends. I ordered the new roasted vegetable salad and a cup of the vegetarian tortilla soup. I used to love the grilled vegetable salad and was pissed when they replaced it on the menu with roasted vegetable salad. Not good. I struggled through it because my friends paid for my dinner and I didn't want to waste their money. But it was gross, and I vowed never to order it again. The soup was good though. The last time I went was with my sister, husband and niece. This time I ordered the new caramelized peach salad. On the menu, most of the new items sound really good. Its just the execution of them that fails...\n\nReview rating:",

Yeah, the area is a little \\\"hood\\\" but Thai Grill itself is anything but.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is clean, dim, and quiet. It's much nicer inside than I would expect from a restaurant that shares a parking lot with Food 4 Less.\\n\\nI got my order to-go and used the \\\"$7 for $10\\\" Yelp coupon. The cashier seemed a little confused about whether the coupon was worth $7 or $10, but she ended up taking my word for it that it was worth $10. *sigh* She was really sweet about it, so I just assume she must have been new. \\n\\nI placed my order for the Cashew entree with all veggies and the Fresh Ginger entree with tofu, both at about an 8 or 9 for spiciness. The cashier said it'd be about ten minutes. The food came out when she promised, and both entrees included a serving of steamed rice (it didn't specify that on the menu).  \\n\\nBoth entrees were full of flavor but they weren't as spicy as I would have expected. I know the spicy-scale is relative to the restaurant and that a 9 at one restaurant might be a 6 at another. But really-- my food was probably more like a 7 to someone who hates spicy food, and like a 4 to someone who loves spicy food. It tasted like it was toned down a lot... or maybe the cook just didn't think I was being serious when I said 8 or 9.\\n\\nAlso, both entrees were super oily! I've never experienced this at any Thai restaurant I've ever been to so I don't know if this was a one time thing, or if this is normal at Thai Grill... but I was literally wiping my mouth with a napkin after each bite because the oil was so thick that it was coating my lips! \\n\\nI wasn't exactly thrilled about the oily food, but the food was pretty tasty so I'm willing to go back and try it again just in case it was an isolated incident.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

The dining room is upstairs and is nice enough in a traditional way, but the look and ambience are very dated.  The quality of service is not in line with the menu.  Our server was clearly overwhelmed.  Our table had white linens bespeaking of a \\\"nice\\\" restaurant but was set improperly.  Wrong silverware, no bread plates.  We sat for quite some time before our drink order was taken, then our waiter left in the middle of taking the drink order to serve food to another table.  He eventually returned to take our drink order and then asked us for our entire food order at the same time.  Bread service was slow though the bread was good.  The glass of riesling we ordered was clearly from a bottle that had been left open for too long.  Another glass from a fresh bottle arrived after a while.\\n\\nWe ordered some salads to start off the meal.  The bistro salad looked great - field greens, asparagus, potato, poached egg, bacon, vinaigrette.  However, when the salad arrived, there was no bacon.  Ahem.  \\\"Excuse me, but our salads have no bacon.\\\"  Response: \\\"OMG, forgot the bacon.\\\"  Instead of taking our salads away and giving us new ones, we were given small bowls of bacon pieces to put on the salads ourselves.  Please.\\n\\nWe ordered a wild mushroom pizza with sausage and gorgonzola but we wanted to substitute goat cheese for the gorgonzola.  We were told this was not possible.  Restaurant policy is no substitutions, just subtractions.  We could remove the g-z but could not add goat cheese.  We ended up using the build your own pizza option and built the pizza we wanted.  What a pain in the a**!  The pizza was delicious though.  The thin crust must be one of the best I've ever had.\\n\\nThe entrees were generally very good.  The American \\\"kobe\\\" skirt steak was tasty, having a sweet...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, I feel the bar is raised for places like this. It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. \\n\\nSo, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \\n\\nAs for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \\n\\nThat's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place.

The restaurant is in a small strip mall in Chinatown Las Vegas, which would be easy to pass by if you weren't paying attention.\\n\\nI am in Vegas a lot for work, and I make an effort to come out to Pho So 1 pretty much every time I am in the area. The food is hit or miss sometimes - it ranges from average to amazing. For that alone I would normally give a 4-star rating, but the cleanliness and quality of service have declined a bit since I first started coming here.\\n\\nRestaurant is decent size and always seems busy, plus it is open pretty late which is convenient when you need pho as a hangover cure. Like I mentioned earlier, the pho tends to vary in quality but when it's good, it is really, really good. The egg rolls (cha gio - the fried egg rolls) are almost always excellent.\\n\\nI hate to say that aloof service tends to be pretty standard with most Asian restaurants, but it definitely seems to be the case here. Not that they're rude or mean, but they are not that attentive and can take quite a while to come around to you. My most recent visit, I didn't receive my ice water until I was nearly done with my pho despite the fact that I had been asking for it pretty frequently.\\n\\nThat said, the quality of food here is almost always so good I can't resist. So I put aside my dislikes and drive out to Pho So 1 to dive into an awesome bowl of pho!\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

However, I waited over 20 minutes for my food and not be given a #, the servers just walk around and see who it belongs to.\\nSo, the chicken was seasoned great, and I enjoyed the sauce and pita bread, but the Greek salad was bland and the fries cold and not cooked or hard a rock.\\nNot the best Greek in my mind.\nSo I would like to give it",

It was cold- not even warm. A lil too creamy and not too flavorful. \\n\\nCrawfish \\u00c9touff\\u00e9e: 5/5 **DELICIOUS** served w/ fluffy white rice & temperature was just right.

The crispy crepe dipped in chocolate was chewy and sweet. Perfect accompaniment. Sauce was not too sweet. Delicious ending to our dinner \\n\\nOur dinner included the house salad which was just your average mixed greens. The dressing was on the tart side. \\n\\nNow for the service...IMPECCABLE.

Lots of unique Asian food and meats (every organ of the pig and cow) and even fish that they hold in a tank to keep it fresh before butchering which was neat to see. My bf was overjoyed when he found some noodle packages he had and loved a long time ago and immediately stuffed 10 packs into our basket. If you wanna find all things Asian (and food from other countries like the middle east and Hawaii) come here. My rating for this place is",

        "They were a place I've been to regularly and rant and raved about it, but they were way off today. We waited for a delivery and received a late call stating that no one answered the door and that the driver had to climb over the fence. We were home all day, being vigilant and waiting. The fence was locked and in no way broken. Do you not know how to open a fence? In past delivers, the fence was locked in a sense that there was a pin in a holder, but past drivers were able to figure out there way in. Not that hard. Received attitude asking if I would be home this time to get the order, ASSUMING that we were lying which we weren't. There is the possibility that they were lying and probably late on delivering the order. We asked why the driver didn't call us, and apparently his phone died, that's the driver's responsibility to have a phone handy. I understand this could happen and I understand the frustration, but there was no need to give attitude to your client that is keeping YOU employed. Never again.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I take back my first review about this place, I will never take my dogs there again. We went in for a simple procedure, getting neutered. My dog got a blood clot after, they werent sure what went wrong and when I decided to do a pop in visit to check on my dog he was laying on a cement cell with no a/c and it was over 100 degrees that day. His legs were now swollen and no one noticed when I asked them why. He was also running a fever, I took my dog from that place and went to a different vet to get a second opinion. My dog almost died that day, thank god we stopped in, he went thro 2 more surgeries at the new vet. He had fluid leaking from his scrotum into his legs, they had to put tubes in his legs to drain the fluid. The coolidge hospital never even called after I left that day and I have been going there for 3 yrs now with my dogs. Just goes to show how much they dont care. This place deserves no stars\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

Sometimes when you start things off on a bad note, things only go downhill from there. The place looks great when you walk in, very nice decor happy people galore. We had a party of two and were told it was going to be 15 minutes which was fine seeing it was new years eve and everywhere was packed. It was more like 20, which is fine unless parties of 4 or more that came in 10 minutes after you are being sat first. When we said something 30 seconds later we were brought to our table. I would have rather sat at the bar seeing it was a small table in a awkward place. Still looked pretty decent, minus what looked like a leaky roof with missing tiles and stains. The chips were good, the salsa was trying to hard with the whole roasted  chipotle thing and was not that good. But we were hungry and finished pretty much the whole small bowl before we were even offered drinks (10-15 min). Strike 2! So My wife ordered a Draft american beer. It tasted horible, something was wrong with the tap. We told the waiter and instantly he said, \\\"it tastes like copper right?\\\" How are you guys going to know something is wrong and do nothing about it. He suggested that we stuck with mexican beer because there is no problem with that tap, My wife ordered a bottled beer. We ordered our food right away, I had the sonoran which was a shredded beef burro, cheese enchilada, and beef tamale, and my wife had stuffed chicken. My burro was covered in 50 cent nacho cheese, and filled with meat that was unseasoned and bland. My wifes dish was decent, could have been better, was a little to stong tasting on the seasoning. We asked for the check immediatly, and could tell by the three tables around us, that we were not alone in this bad expierience. They push this place off like it's authentic, it's really just crappy tex mex food. Go to Macayos, or even Garcias for better food, prices, and expierience.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review: I am a nervous dental patient. Because of the this, I am particular when selecting a dentist (moved to the area 2 years ago.) It has been about 3 years since I've had a cleaning, my front tooth just chipped, gums are sensitive, likely 2 fillings need replacement and am interested in orthodontia treatment. My initial contact was with the receptionist, Ginger. She returned my voice mail within 24 hrs (I called after business hours). She is professional, courteous, patient, and kind. Because I had much work to be done I wanted to consult and meet the dentist prior to any work. She scheduled the consult. A few days later I visited the office and she addressed me, \\\"Melissa?\\\" Kind of her to welcome me with a smile and my name. I completed the necessary paperwork and then an assistant gave me a tour of the facility. It is clean and open (which I'm not used to and made me feel a bit exposed for others to see my fear - I'm a bit proud). Dr. Bailey came in within 5 minutes and was compassionate,  understanding, thorough in her explanations, mild mannered and mentioned having Netflix in office for distraction and offered other distraction tools as well to decrease the anxiety. Because of everyone's professionalism and learning they would be a one stop shop, even for orthodontia, I proceeded with scheduling the 1st of a few appointments. So, based on everything above I rate them with 5 stars and I'll follow up with additional reviews as I move through my treatment.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: Stayed here for about 3 days since there was a conference going on.\\n\\nI would say it is in a pretty nice location.  Located at the end of Uptown (?), I did walk up Tryon and College St. a bit to check out the rest of the Uptown area, and it was no more than 10-15 minutes walking to the different restaurants.\\n\\nFor a Westin, it is one of the newer ones I've been to.  Westin really knows how to design their lobby and create a spacious setting.  The lobby is relaxed and oddly welcoming, which you can't really say about a lot of hotels.\\n\\nThe staff was courteous and we checked in with no problem.  The rooms were a nice surprise as it is fairly spacious.  All the usual amenities are there, such as internet, LCD TV etc, and who doesn't love the Heavenly bed and the shower heads??  Although one thing I didn't like was definitely the lack of a mini-fridge.  They only had the mini-bar fridge and you have to request a key to unlock it.  Even after you do unlock it, there's no room for you to put anything there, and I was too afraid of getting charged if anything was moved.\\n\\nInternet does cost around $13 a night, which is fairly high, but at this point, I've accepted the charges for internet is an expense I will be paying.\\n\\nThe gym at this Westin is amazing.  The gym is connected to the pool with a \\\"refresh area\\\" after you swim.  The gym itself is quite big, especially for hotel standards!  Bikes, elliptical, plenty of treadmills, and a few weight-training machines.  All the cardio machines have their own TV and if you have your headphones, you can just plug it in.  Even if you don't have headphones, they have disposable headphones there that you can use for free!  They also provide fresh towels, as well as water dispensers.  I definitely took advantage of the gym while I stayed there.\\n\\nAs for the conference space, it does a pretty good job, with plenty of meeting rooms and ballrooms.  Of course, the conference i was attending only had several hundred of people, which isn't that big for a conference. ...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review: I stopped by this restaurant for lunch the other day with 2 friends and was very impressed by all that they have on hand.  The menu, in paper and on the wall, is quite large, and with just enough time to eat and run to the next appointment, I quickly skimmed the menu and settled on a half sandwich (roast beef) and the New England clam chowder.  One friend chose the same as me except the potato soup and a 1/2 of aturkey club, and the other friend chose a cheesy baked potato.  If you are familiar with this restaurant, which has many locations throughout the Charlotte area, you will remember that you must order at the counter.  It was a very quick and friendly process at this location.  Also, a nice older gentleman that comes around and ask you how you are doing, if he can be of any help, and asks if he can clear stuff away for you.  Now the food part:  My roast beef sandwich was lacking in thickness of meat, and a bit fatty on the roast beef.  My New England clam chowder was hot...it's hard to please a New Englander when it comes to chowda'...but not hardly any clams, too uniformed cut potatoes and lots of emulsifiers does not a chowder make. Now onto my friends plates.  The potato soup was described as hot and creamy and the 1/2 a turkey club sandwich was quite large and nicely put together.  The baked potato that my other friend had was gi-normous.  I'm telling you, this thing could have been used as a regulation sized football.  Where the heck do they find potatoes that big I wonder?  Really, I had to do a triple take to see whether it was 2 potoatoes cleverly disguised as one, but it wasn't, it was just one big 'tater.  Okay, I know, I'm going to far on the size of the potato, but boy did it look goooooooddd!  It had 2 types of cheese, a nice cheddar cheese for color and a wonderful stringy mozzarella.  \\nThe prices for all these items came up to about $25.00.  Really pretty good for 3 people needing a quick lunch.\\nI'll go back to McAlister's again, but I think, next time, I'll be ordering that pig skin of...\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Entree would have been the perfect amount of food. Side daal or salad served before meal. Goat curry was mild, tender and tasty. Simple atmosphere. Fast and friendly service. Would go here all the time if it were in my own neighbourhood.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

That's why we had 4 different ones. \\n\\nI had a better service at a 'mom and pop' pho place in San Diego than this place, considering this is a tourist town. Their egg roll is rock solid.

        "Let me start this by saying I got on the wrong bus and ended up walking from Garfield to Bloomfield and then once in Bloomfield I proceeded to get lost behind West Penn Hospital. With that being said I was hoping that all my stumbling around in the elements would not be in vain.   \\n\\nThe food at Thai Cuisine is more pitiful than my sense of direction. I ordered Threes Company: shrimp, scallops and calamari in a Thai chili sauce. The sauce is my favorite part of a Thai meal but Thai Cuisine came up short here. What I enjoy must about a Thai chili sauce is the complexity of flavors but this sauce in my dish was your standard thin runny brown sauce.  The kind that comes with lets say beef and broccoli.  I think the menu description was misleading and had I known it would be brown sauce I would have ordered something else.  \\n\\nSome of the onions in my dish were cold which leads me to believe that the food was not cooked to order or at least not all of it.  There was plenty of shrimp in the dish and the calamari tasted great, but the dish lacked flavor. The carrots and broccoli was cooked beyond recognition.\\n\\nFor my hubby I ordered the Thai steak , it tasted like a frozen salisbury steak dinner and salisbury steak just so happens to be one my least favorite foods.  Had I not sampled his dinner this would have been a solid three star review. \\n\\nI see no reason to go back here.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "This restaurant ruined my New Year's Eve! My husband and I made a reservation for 10pm, thinking it would be a fun place to be at midnight - we were wrong. We were told we had the table for 2 hours, and there were all sorts of rules about how you couldn't cancel or be late or else they'd charge you. We were a few minutes early, and pretty much the first thing our server said to us when we sat down was, \\\"Our kitchen is about to close.\\\" Why they take reservations for 10pm if that's when the kitchen closes, I can't imagine. So, we quickly put in our order (we both wanted their special New Year's Eve 3 course prix fixe menu), and continued to be rushed through the entire meal. \\n\\nThe appetizer was disappointing - my husband ordered Fried Goat Cheese and the portion was so teeny tiny; the cheese pieces were about the size of a dime. I had the Cioppino, which was supposed to be mussels, scallops, and shrimp in a lobster-saffron broth. There was no shrimp, and the mussels and scallops were so miniature that they had no flavor whatsoever. The broth and garlic bread were good.\\n\\nWhile we were still eating our appetizers they brought out the soup/salad course, which is so rude and made us feel rushed. My husband's Lobster Bisque was good, but again, very small portion. I had the Roasted Cauliflower Salad, which turned out to be an arugula salad, garnished with a few small shavings of cauliflower.\\n\\nAgain, while we were still eating our soup/salad, they brought out our entree, and by that time we were pretty annoyed and asked if they could keep the entrees hot while we finished our current course. Our server was visibly impatient/annoyed and said that her manager didn't want our entrees in the window, but agreed to bring them back anyway. When we were finished and she brought our entrees back out they were lukewarm. The flavors were good, but would have been much better if prepared/served at the appropriate time.\\n\\nThen we asked to see the dessert menu and our server said no, the kitchen is closed. We asked to...\nSo I would like to give it",

Where the heck were all the beers? On quantity alone for beer, this place failed me. \\n\\nWell, how about the quality of the selection? No bueno? Nope. Very few things I couldn't find at a Trader Joe's or Whole Foods, first of all, and very few of the rare beers a whale hunter like myself goes after. It doesn't matter where I go, I usually stumble upon some rarity or five and walk out of the store with buyer's remorse at the amount I just spent. Not here. There were very, very few beers of note here. I almost didn't find the Double Jack I came for and that beer is very ubiquitous in the states that border Cali.\\n\\nBut here's the real kicker and why I give the two stars rather than three. I'm that snob that, if I were to have an establishment selling beer, I'd keep my inventory clean, keep an eye on freshness dates and expirations, and make sure my customers were getting the beers the way the brewery intended. So that Double Jack, a hop-heavy beer that is best consumed fresh, really shouldn't have a bottled on date of January 2013 and still be on shelves. That's not fair to consumers or the breweries. Lee's either doesn't manage their inventory correctly or doesn't care about their consumers. Either way, bad business.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

My mom had a guy and I had some lady, when we went to put our feet in the water and  we both had to say our water was way too hot and they needed to cool it down. Neither of the people we had were very friendly, we barely go a hello out o feither them and never once got their names, the most they spoke to us was when they wanted to be paid and I'm pretty sure the lady doesn't speak much English.\\n\\nIf you come in with a design idea, say from Pintrest, just forget asking them to do it. I showed the lady what design I wanted, it was something that I thought would be relatively simple, I just wanted the colors different from the photo, I had to explain exactly what I wanted, not a big deal but then she started doing it and it was already not looking right so I questioned it, and she seemed confused. The guy that was working on my moms toes had to tell her in another language what I wanted, she still fully didn't get it but she was trying. She was starting to finish up and asked me if I liked it, I did ask her to make one of the colors (the silver horizontal line going through all of my toes) more prominent, she did that, for the most part. Then she asked me if I liked it, it looked okay and she said she would fix it if I didn't like, I thought I could deal with it. Then I went to sit with my mom for our feet to dry and then we both got a closer look and they looked extremely sloppy. I probably could have done a better job. She asked if everything was okay and I told her they didn't look as good as I thought, the silver line I wanted was a big glob of glitter that was uneven. She said she would redo them, I ended up asking her to just do my toes one solid color. I told her at least three times which color I wanted and she picked up a different color and asked me if I wanted that one, the guy had to tell her which color I wanted.

        "Review: I had a wonderful evening, it was far more than I expected.  First I took the incline up from the Sheraton on Wednesday evening last week.  It was a short walk from the station.  I was pleasantly surprised to find upon entering I would be taking an elevator UP further to the restaurant the view from the elevator was even more spectacular than from the incline.  The place was busy but the hostess told me I could enjoy the same view and menu from the bar.  The view there did not disappoint, nor did the staff.  I found out about this place from the cab driver that drove me to the hotel from the airport, he raved about the crab cake being better than the ones in MD.  I did try the crab cake as an appetizer, it was very good, delicious, not as good as one from Faidleys but it was very good, quite tasty.  The bar staff was very receptive, very helpful in my wine selections.  I had a brut with my crab cake and a Murphy Goode sauvignon  blanc with a grilled salmon with their house remoulade and a side of broccollini.  It was perfect and the wine suited the meal.  Did I mention the view?  from my seat in the bar it was great.  I also want to comment that one of the staff, maybe a sommelier came down, popped open a bottle of wine and asked the bartender and wait staff to taste it, think about the flavors and he'd be back to discuss.  I really enjoyed listening to him and the staff interact and learn something they could share with a future customer about a bottle of wine.  Anyway, the staff was pleasant, view was magnificent and well worth the walk a mile down to the other incline to take me back to the Sheraton.  If I ever come back to downtown Pittsburgh, I will definitely stop and bring others up to this great place.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

After we left Grimaldis, I looked this place up and decided to swing by.\\n\\nThere were a few people in there which was good because it gave me time to scope out what I wanted.  I decided to go with a medium, half chocolate, half peanut M&M.  They sure do give you a lot of gelato.  It was only $5 bucks and they give you a packed 8 ounce cup.  I paid my money and took my gelato outside to eat by my car.\\n\\nThe chocolate was really good and the peanut M&M tasted exactly like a chewed up peanut M&M.  It was a great blend of flavors.  The only thing that was a tad off, was the texture of it. After every bite, I had a \\\"filmy\\\" taste/feel in my mouth.  Hard to describe but I know for sure I didn't have that type of sensation at the other place I ate at earlier today.  The odd after bite texture keeps this from being perfect.

        "My words in this review will most likely not convey my disappointment with this establishment.  However, I will try my best.  I dropped off a prescription Tuesday evening.  I pulled up to the drive-thru and waited at the window for over 5 minutes without being acknowledged.  Not a \\\"hi, we'll be right with you\\\" Nothing.  I wasn't in a hurry and understand that these places can get crazy busy so I waited this time without pressing the \\\"Call for service\\\" button and when I finally did, waited another several minutes before I was rudely greeted by a younger girl who looked like she would rather be doing anything at that moment besides helping me.  I then gave her the prescription and it took her another several minutes to tell me that they would have to order it and it wouldn't be available for me to pick up until that Friday!  I was a little upset that I needed my medication and would not be able to obtain it until then, but I figured what can I do, and agreed to be there Friday to pick it up.  Upon arriving Friday after work, I was in a hurry to get home and figured they had plenty of time to get it good and ready for me by Friday afternoon and assumed it wouldn't take more than a couple minutes.  First off, they only had one of what I had been expecting three of, THEN they wanted to charge me over 80 dollars for something that has always cost me 10.  I said that there must be some mistake and the \\\"kid\\\" behind the counter said he didn't know what to tell me except this is what they are supposed to charge according to my insurance company.  So I left, extremely upset, without my medication.  Then I called my Insurance company and I was told that CVS was wrong and I was only supposed to pay the 10 dollars as usual.  When I went back, I was prepared to sit and wait as long as it took in order to get my medication at the price I was supposed to be charged.  I ended up spending over an hour in the CVS this time until they finally figured out they were wrong.  I ended up leaving that day with my medication which...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "From the street, my husband and I thought Zoe's Kitchen would be like Panera - that is, we thought it would serve fast, flavorful, and good-quality lunch fare. None of these adjectives turned out to be an accurate descriptor. In fact, the food at Zoe's kitchen took 30 minutes to come out and was disgustingly bland and in a few cases, quite gross. \\n\\nWe stopped in for lunch last week. The place was packed, but the line to order moved quickly, so we incorrectly assumed that we would also get our food quickly. More on that in a second. In terms of the menu, we were shocked at how uninteresting the menu options seemed. Even though the menu was decently sized and we are open to lots of different types of food and flavors, we found ourselves completely unable to choose and not drawn to any individual option. \\n\\nEven though I'm not a vegetarian, I prefer lunch sandwiches with no meat, so I was also quite irritated that the only vegetarian sandwiches were the grilled cheese and grilled feta. This is 2008, and the non-meat options at a lunch spot should be more imaginative than cheese slapped on some bread. In the end, I still ended up ordering the grilled cheese (nothing else sounded good!) and my husband selected the Greek Chicken Marinara. \\n\\nWe sat down at the table, displayed our number card, and just waited. And waited. And waited. After literally waiting for 25 minutes, I checked in with the assistant manager who was manning the pick-up counter. She went into the kitchen, checked on our order, and said it would be just a \\\"few more minutes.\\\" She even had a server bring us two slices of chocolate cake as some sort of  token of their sympathy, but it was super-dry and totally gross. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm just glad we didn't pay $2 for each slice!\\n\\nIt wasn't until 10 minutes later when I lost my patience and told the same server that we wanted our food immediately that we finally received it. We have a higher-than-average awareness of the difficulties of working in food service, but we found it...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "I swear. Some friends never steer me wrong when it comes to deliciousness. \\n\\nI was told the house special chicken is the thing to try at China Chili. However, after looking at the menu, and discovering an item by the name of pillow chicken that included the phrase \\\"pillow shaped morsels\\\" how could I resist? There was none of that resistance crap. That food was in my belly fast! The pillow chicken was chicken mixed with onion, bamboo shoot and I believe something else and breaded into little pillow sized wonder. It was laid on top of steamed broccoli and then covered in a black pepper sauce. I wish it was spiced with something more than pepper, but other than that I have no complaints. It was so filling (in the good way, not the I'm gonna get sick way like most Chinese I have) I was only able to eat half. \\n\\nI loved the huge round tables in the center with the lazy susans. They reminded me of ones at a fantastic restaurant near where I grew up. The inside is really spacious and has some fantastic traditional decor. The menu was so large that I found several things I'd like to try next time including a whole section of chow fun food. Fun? Yep. I'd like some.\\n\\nDownside? The parking lot is tiny and narrow. Parking in a space perfectly if there are cars on both sides of the spot is a feat I'd love to see mastered.\nSo I would like to give it",

I was told that they were still trying to find someone to come to my house... wait, didn't they have over three hours to do that? Still, I needed the ride, so I sighed and agreed to wait another ten minutes. After that ten minutes, I got a call from the dispatcher saying that they'd found someone to take the call and he'd be there in ten minutes. So now my ETA was 8:30, and I needed to meet a friend at 8:40. For the biggest concert of the year. I was not happy, but what could I do? So I waited. At 8:40, my driver called. He couldn't find my address in his GPS (later, we came to discover that was because dispatch had given him an incorrect spelling). I gave him verbal directions, then called dispatch again.\\n\\nI voiced that I felt this was unacceptable. I had called ahead so that I could avoid a long wait and being late to meet my friend. The dispatcher seemed pretty unconcerned that customer that would be paying approximately $40 for their service was, at this point, irate. The man I spoke with said, \\\"Well, everyone is trying to get to the same concert you are going to.\\\" I replied, yes, that was why I'd called well in advance. He remained blase and largely unapologetic. At that point, my driver finally arrived, so I hung up.\\n\\nAt nearly 8:50, my driver arrived. I have no complaints about him- he was courteous, drove like a bat out of hell to get me to the strip in a timely fashion, and he had the decency to do what his employers wouldn't, and apologized. Unfortunately, I remain completely unimpressed with the company as a whole.\\n\\nI would not recommend Ace Cabs, at all. They were unreliable and unapologetic. And worst of all, they were nearly an hour late, and I missed the first three artists at my concert as result. Major fail.\n\nReview rating:",

We asked if they had BYOB since we were actually planning to go to a BYOB restaurant, but the cork fee was $15 so it wasn't worth it. They do have a nice bar, so that's completely understandable. I got the usual, and now I kind of consider myself a pumpkin curry expert since it's the 4th place I have sampled it in PGH. My boyfriend got a sweet potato basil curry with chicken. Both of our heat levels were pretty weak, I ordered a 5 and got more like a 2, and boyfriend agreed.

The bartender said that they \\\"make them fresh every day\\\" - ours had apparently been made in the morning and had sat around in their own cold grease all day.   We politely sent them back but the bartender didn't seem very happy about it and we spend the remainder of the visit wondering if we were going to have to argue with her about paying for them (as it turned out, we were not charged). \\n\\nFinal thoughts: it's a cool bar, but the novelty has worn off for us.

        "This used to be my FAVORITE place. I used to be able to find various hidden treasures for a good price. I got a few mid-century-esque pieces without breaking the bank. Yes, they had a scratch here or there, but they looks great in my house. Plus, Saturdays are half off, making weekend treasure hunts an every week event.\\n\\nHowever things have changed recently.. There seems to be a new employee who has started in the past 6 months. She seems to think that all the items there are SOOO amazing and prices them way to high for what you are getting. The furniture still has scratches or dings or needs to be cleaned up, you can't charge like it is new. You are a tiny, local shop. You have to price accordingly. I've even seen IKEA items priced like new. People give you things for FREE..it only seems fair to me that you wouldn't try to rape people with your pricing.\\n\\nI've been putting off my review because I wanted to give them a good review, but things just keep getting worse. \\n\\nSad.

She always does it just right!\\nThis is a cute salon, which is in what I think was an old house at some point. There are a bunch of different (small) rooms, so you are never in a room with more than 1 or maybe 2 other people getting their hair done at a time. I find this very preferable over the regular salon line of 10 chairs. It's a much more private experience.  The atmosphere is pretty laid back; not at all snooty (like I've found some salons to be).  \\nI know they have services other than hair (nails, massages), but I've never used those, so I can't comment.\\nIf I had any complaints, it would be about 1) the parking; which sucks. They have a very small lot you can park in (if you're lucky - I've only gotten a space there early on a Saturday morning), but otherwise you are stuck with the street parking on Lombardy. And it is right across the street from Bad Daddy's (used to be Big Daddy's), so you are competing with those patrons, as well as people that live on that street, for parking. 2) the pricing; which seems a bit high to me ($160 for partial cut and color). Maybe my perspective is off, but that feels high to me. \\nOverall, as far as hair care is concerned, I would give it 5 stars.

        "Review text:\nUnfortunately, I must update my review based on my most recent dining experience at Mi Patio.  The BF and I stopped in on a Saturday night for a late dinner right before closing.  I have a cast-iron stomach and I almost never have problems with anything I eat.  \\n\\nI ordered the taco salad with beef machaca.  When it arrived, the beef was cold and I only ate two bites as a result.  I surmise the beef had been left out to cool (probably for too long) since the restaurant was about to close.  Needless to say, a few short hours later in the middle of the night I came down with the worst case of food poisoning I have ever experienced.  This wasn't \\\"Oh, I don't feel so good\\\" food poisoning.  This was, \\\"Should I go to the hospital?\\\" food poisoning.  It was so bad I was unable to travel for work the following week.  \\n\\nMi Patio is now permanently off my list of acceptable eateries; it's just not worth the risk.  Adios, Mi Patio!\n\nStars:",

        "Good doctor but horrible care. \\n\\nDr. Swainston's office is horribly managed. From three hours waits for appointments,  to \\\"forgetting\\\" to send prescriptions to the pharmacy to \\\"forgetting\\\" to follow up on positive lab test results, and \\\"forgetting\\\" that you are there for an appointment, they are the worst run medical practice I have ever seen. \\n\\nI understand that some of the problem may stem from the fact that Dr. Swainston is a good surgeon and he has a busy practice. But lots of doctors have busy practices yet they have adequate competent staffing. You can never get access to him and it's almost impossible to even get the attention of a nurse. You have to double check everything that is being done as they promise to do things and then do it wrong or never do it at all. You have to constantly be on hold only for them to take a message and then not bother calling you back. \\n\\nFor a prescription that was supposed to have several refills authorized, I had to call nurse to get it, called twice without a call back, and finally gave up trying to get the nurse. I got an appointment to see the doctor to try to get it filled, get told that they had sent it in and that pharmacy had made a mistake, told me they would resend it to make sure, never sent it, had to wait for 4 days over a long weekend to get a nurse to call me back to try to get it authorized. Why does it take over a half dozen phone calls and an additional doctor visit to follow up just to get one prescription that was supposed to have refills already to get written properly? Why does it have to take 6 hours out of my life to get one prescription properly filled?\\n\\nThis is just one example. \\n\\nI had a surgery with Dr. Swainston several months ago. I had a lot of complications. And I believe that all of them were due to the fact there was not proper care before and after the surgery. So does it matter how good a surgeon is if the pre-care and post-care is crappy? I suffered needlessly for months due to their bad care. \\n\\nIf you have any other...\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Pretty good for a decent price.  The rolled taco plate was the special and it was only $4.50.  They came with a topping of quacamole and cheese and they were quite good.  The quesadilla my daughter had was huge and full of nicely melted cheese.  She loved it but then you really can't go too wrong with a quesadilla.  The place was fairly busy with about 5 tables occupied.  It could have been just a bit cleaner in terms of the floor and tables but it was not bad.  They may have just had a rush and not had the chance to come out and clean.  I'll give them benifit of the doubt on that one.  \\n\\nI will go back and try more items on the menu.  They have specials every day and a fairly vaired menu.  It's located in a strip mall next to Starbucks and just down the way is Angel Sweet for dessert.  Overall it was decent.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Had dinner for the first time in Portland's. Had been there for happy hour before. It's a decent place to meet up with friends. I think the atmosphere is more impressive than the food. They have the bar/lounge separated far enough from the dining room. It's not a place where I have to struggle to hear the person across from me. I also like the decor and art work they have. \\n\\nSo far, my foray into the food qualifies as so-so. They have good french fries but I don't think they are worth $7 a plate. I appreciate how they highlight the use of local ingredients in the food. I went for the Schreiner's sausage pasta which had penne and a smattering of seasonal vegetables covered in marinara. The dish was flavorful enough. On the one hand, I was happy that it was just the right portion. On the other, I thought there might be more for $16. Our waiter was nice though our appetizers seemed really slow in getting to the table. But that was more likely the kitchen's doing, not his. Anyway, go here for a nice urban vibe. But if you are looking for a place to show a visiting foodie, you could probably find something better.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "this is for our stay on the weekend of July 13, 2013\\n\\nI thought about giving one star, but decided to give two, only because it is affordable.  I didn't expect much either because of the affordable price.  you shouldn't expect much either.\\n\\nCANCELLATIONS - a few nights before, we almost had to cancel our plans to vegas .... I called really late evening (around 1130pm) to cancel our reservation, and the operator was plain rude.  we reserved through expedia and expedia gave us their confirmation number and the hotel confirmation number.  my confirmation email specifically said to cancel through the hotel, and when you click the link, it takes you directly to hooters and gives you hooters number to call for cancellation.  it also says to cancel before midnight to to avoid any other fees.  I call at 1130pm, but the rude operator told me reservations are closed at this time and I'd have to call back in the morning??  she also told me rudely that i have to cancel through expedia, and after i told her expedia directed me to hooters, that's when she told me to call back in the morning (to speak to someone who actually knew the answers).  whatever ..... thank goodness we found out our plans came through, so VEGAS HERE WE COME!!\\n\\nCHECK IN - we checked in on a thursday around 5pm.  not busy at all.  of course, the girl (not lady) at the front desk didn't seem happy about working here.  not welcoming, no smile .... again, whatever .... WE MADE IT TO VEGAS!! \\n\\nHOTEL APPEARANCE - filthy elevators (garage and hotel elevators) .... the elevator doors to your hotel room are just nasty.  like housekeeping hasn't wiped them down in years .....I thought it would be wiped down by the next morning ..... nope!  filthy the whole time.  garage elevators seem like they will drop with you in it any time .... again, whatever .... I wasn't expecting much for an average $56 a night ..... \\n\\nroom is ok .... comparable to motel 6 .... one of the mattresses obviously needs to be replaced ...... the first thing we noticed was that...\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review text:\nThe BF and I went here last night for dinner because we had a Groupon. The place is very cute, small, but in a cozy way. After being seated, we were brought some delicious olive bread with herb butter....seriously yummy stuff. As we looked over the menu we were a little disappointed that it had changed and had not been updated on their website (we both kind of picked out what we wanted before even getting there...what?...we were excited!). I was originally going to get the filet because it sounded good on their online menu and came with risotto (which I love), but the new menu had it with roasted potatoes (which I thought sounded really boring) so I decided not to get it. The BF was going to get the herb encrusted chicken or pork, but instead got the chicken cordon bleu (since they no longer have the pork or the other chicken). The menu changes weren't really that big a deal, at least that means the restaurant is keeping it fresh.  My real problem with the ordering process was our waitress. She really rubbed me the wrong way. She seemed like she did not want to be working. Additionally, she was not knowledgeable about the menu and had clearly not tasted anything. For example, I asked her opinion between the filet and the duck and she said 'well, it depends on if you like steak or duck.' Well....ya. Clearly it depends on that...but if I like both....maybe give me more explanation about each dish??? I honestly don't think she knew much about it, and that was the problem. She probably should have tasted the dishes.  Anyway, I went with the duck and it was just ok. The fat was rendered from the skin, but the skin was soggy and chewy...not crunchy at all. The cherry sauce was good (I like how it had whole cherries in it), as were the mashed potatoes (very buttery). The harit coverts were good, but a bit crunchier than the BF liked. His chicken was good (in my opinion) but he wasn't a fan of the sauce, which was a dijon mustard sauce. He said he felt like he was eating a fancy deli sandwich....which I guess I can...\n\nStars:",

        "So we visited this establishment on a nice a lonely night during Christmas break. I did my research on my beloved yelp and should have erred on the side of caution and \\\"followed my guts\\\" instinct.  Upon entry I realized this was going to suck...The lounging around nonchalant hostesses slowly took us to a seat, but it wasn't like rocket science, as there was only one other customer and his lady friend chomping on some food. We ordered our soda drinks which came in some real thin cup type things loaded with ice. Did they not have a fountain machine on site??? Not sure. Moreover, it came time to order.....we ordered our dishes and an app. Let me say that the Kung Pao that I ordered was the worse tasting dish I have ever had at any Chinese food place. Cutting corners aren't ya....With about 3 sticks of chopped celery. And a bunch of peanuts....not even real brown sauce. The app we got sucked as well. I felt like walking out after it appeared as though something suspicious was going on when the hippy looking cook came out to chill with the girls....dude this is not an authentic Chinese food place.  I understand that I am in east Mesa...but for real, panda express serves it much better than this place. I WISH I could get refunded the absurd amount of close to 40 bucks I spent on a family of three......for such little food and such a bunk tasting meal. Heck....I can rock the wok much better.

It's miserable to be there on the weekend when it's so crowded because it's such a small space. The only reason I'm giving this bar 2 instead of 1 star is because the karaoke on Fridays (if you can handle the people and the crowd) is pretty good- although there are half a dozen better places to karaoke in Pittsburgh.

Such a beautiful Friday evening, we opted to sit on the patio which has a very nice view of the lake and fountain. We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Lavosh Wood-fired pizza, Three Cheese and Spinach Quesadilla and the Philly Steak pita. Let me just say it all LOOKED great, it just tasted very bland :(...not enough spice in any of the dishes to make it flavorful (and I don't care for spicy food, so for me to say that it, is pretty darn bland!) Our server was sweet, but not the most attentive. She never checked on us after our food arrived to see if we liked it (she knew we were first-timers) or to refill our drinks. When we were done and she finally came around to clear our plates, we told her the kids did not care for their food and she kindly removed their entrees from the bill. That is the only reason I might decide to give this place a second chance. Maybe we just had an \\\"off\\\" experience...it happens. My rating for this place is",

Through the recommendation of my new Vet, I did opt to have an ultra sound (more detailed and less invasive, procedure than biopsy) performed, and discovered the dog had a sever infection of the prostate. The prostate had enlarged to twice the normal size. The infection was actually located on the outside of the prostate and could have spread and possibly killed the dog.  I'm glad I didn't take Dr. Anderson's advice not to perform the biopsy (or similar test). It took immediate surgery and three weeks of antibiotics , but my dog it doing much better. The cost was less than I had expected. I'm glad I didn't  waste any more time waiting for Dr. Anderson to return my  phone calls and recommend treatment. I feel stupid for even waiting that long, but like many people noted on their reviews they trust Dr. Anderson. I was no different, so I waited.

Just go over my head with a really short blade.  $16 is way to much for that and the most I have paid anywhere in the country.  It should be around $10 - $12 at most.

Yeah, they slice the meats, but they must be the poorest quality meat in all the land by the looks of the turkey that was being sliced for the overweight woman in front of me. They were also slapping fresh microwaved bacon on her sandwich and the young sandwich maker had trouble handling the stuff because it was nuked too much. Staying away from the crappy meats saved me a bunch of heartburn, but the safe veggie choice was equally a failure. I guess the zesty parmesan bread was good enough, but all the cheese was processed slices and the lettuce was wet and all the other veggies just didn't have any excitement. Not even \\\"The Blimpie Way\\\" of a an oil and vinegar bath helped. The dirty rag that was used to clean the prep area was also kind of unappetizing. Only positive factory was the price of 5 bucks for a 12 inch sub. Probably should have bailed, but hadn't been to a Blimpie in decades and now I won't ever feel the urge to go back again.\n\nReview score (between 1 and 5):",

        "This place couldn't be more different during the day than at night.\\n\\nLate night, you can't really beat their food specials, and the service is always excellent on the third shift.\\n\\nDuring the day and at night however, this place is kind of a drag. They are total nazis about carding people (even those who are obviously 30+) and it gets really annoying. I understand that you can't serve people under 21 but seriously, develop and use some judgment and common sense, and remember your customers, instead of pretending to forget someone. In general, the servers seem intent on finding ways to avoid serving you, rather than trying to help you have a good experience. Perhaps they are so focused on gaming that they view non-gamers as a hassle, if this is the case, they have done a very good job of passively-aggressively making it clear.\\n\\nThe menu is overpriced and fairly pedestrian, although they do offer really good specials at different times.

        "Review text:\nTook my '67 Camaro here for an alignment, after seeing some positive comments on a Corvette forum about George's. There is no computerized alignment rack here, just alignment plates you drive onto and the eyeballs of whoever is performing the alignment. In no more than 3 minutes, the tech made 2-3 adjustments and told me to 'go drive it' and I did. To my surprise, the overall driveability was improved, and the car seemed to track straight. To my disappointment, there was still a high speed vibration over 60mph (which I had described to the tech) and I knew it wasn't a wheel balance issue because I just had that done. \\n\\nWhile I was impressed in the short-term with what George's accomplished in 3 minutes with a ratchet and a wrench, I would recommend going somewhere with a more modern and computerized approach. My front wheels were never lifted in the air during the 3 minute process, which is a red-flag that the alignment at George's is probably not as thorough as your car deserves. George's also failed to find a loose (by 7 whole turns) lower ball joint which was missing it's cotter pin. And because of the loose ball joint, the alignment had to be redone (I chose another shop to redo it). George's might have found the loose ball joint if the tires actually left the ground...\\n\\n'Old-school alignment' = too cheap to invest in a computerized alignment rack. Today's highway speeds require more accurate alignments, which George's simply can't provide. Cost for the 3-minute alignment at George's? $80 - cash only. Ouch! So much for trusting the Corvette guys...\n\nStars:",

The service was very slow, they brought one of the teens food from the childrens menu when he ordered from the regular menu and to top it all off the bathroom (and I can only speak for the women's bathroom) was disgusting - the trashcan was literally overflowing.

I'm not normally one to order duck, and I really wished I didn't (I was torn about the coffee chicken.  I normally get chicken, but it seemed like an odd combo of flavors). My boyfriend got the seafood au gratin which was much better.\\n\\nThe best part was that I was so full on bread by the time my entree arrived that I didn't feel like so much of an ass asking for most of my meal to be put in a doggie bag.

        "Review text:\nTea Lite Cafe's offers a quick and delicious meal. Located in the same complex as the Harkins 101 Theater, Babies-R-Us and several other large shops. Tea Lite offers a nice meal option for shoppers and business people alike. I recently visited with Gabi M, who is an expert (in my eyes at least) when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine and luckily I was with her to guide me through the menu. I wanted to get a full taste of Tea Lite Cafe, so we ended up ordering the Tea Lite Special which comes with spring rolls, egg rolls and Pho (choice of chicken or beef). This is absolutely the way to go, especially if you're a first timer! It provided a nice variety and was large enough to share. It's also very inexpensive and less than $9 for the entire dish! I thoroughly enjoyed the Pho and added hot sauce and the various spices.  \\n\\nThere's not much to say about the atmosphere because there isn't much to the cafe. It feels like a cafe that you'd find in the busy streets of a big city. It's casual, clean and they featured pictures of the menu items on the wall. The service is incredibly fast too! We barely got our drinks and sat down and our food was already being served! It's perfect for a busy lunch hour. \\n\\nThe owner was very friendly and helpful during our ordering process. We ordered a decent amount of food and after our meal, I decided that I wanted to try a BOBA because I had never had one before. However, I only had a credit card and they have a $5 limit. The owner was so nice that he ended up just giving me the BOBA because I had already ordered so much. It showed their level of customer service and his gesture went a long way. Meow, what are you waiting for? It's time for you to visit for lunch!\n\nStars:",

        "I have been a customer of Thai Lahna for 12 years.  The service I have received on my last three visits has been so bad, I now pledge to never return.  I don't make this decision lightly because they have pretty good food.  Last night I placed an order to go and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I arrived 25 minutes later and was told it would be ready in another 10 minutes.  After waiting another 30 minutes (a total of 55 minutes since I had placed the order), I asked to see the manager who had been in the kitchen this whole time.  I was told she would be right out.  I stood there at the cash register another 10 minutes; no manager.  I asked again to see the manager (my food order was still not ready).  From the kitchen I heard \\\"Tell him I am too busy!\\\"  That was the last straw.  I asked for a refund on my credit card.  Instead of a refund, they charged my card a second time.  While she was fixing that, my order finally came out.  I told them to keep the food and give me my money, which they finally did.  This is a place where management has completely lost touch with what service is all about.  The girl at the counter was trying desperately to help me.  If the manager had put forth even a half effort, I might have been able to shrug it off.  Her total dismissal of the customer prompts me to take my business elsewhere.  I would encourage you to do likewise.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nThe name Ray's is used by over a hundred places in New York. In fact, several NY papers and TV stations have tried over the years to locate the \\\"original\\\" Ray's and as far as I know they've failed. One of the Ray's contenders in NY had a Yelp review that started: \\\"... can be summed up in 4 words \\\"It's better than Sbarro\\\"  Tough crowd!\\n\\nSo what exactly is a New York pizza? \\n\\nWell it has a very thin crust, that when you pick it up, the front flops down. That's why New Yorkers fold it in half. The better tasting ones seem to use San Marzano tomatoes and a better type of mozzarella.  A few dust their pizza with oregano or EVOO.\\n\\nThis Ray's is the closest to that New York pizzeria feel and atmosphere.  It has those glass counters that you will find up there.  It even has what we call Sicilian slices, or \\\"squares\\\".  This Ray's tries real hard and for the most part it succeeds in creating a New York pie. So it's \\\"A-OK\\\" in Yelp-ese.\\n\\nIn my previous review, I said that NYPD makes me feel like I'm waiting for an E train to Queens; whereas Ray's feels more upper east side-ish.  I still believe that's still a fair assessment, though their crusts have suffered over time.  \\n\\nOn some nights, depending on who is making the pies, these two places might only be slightly better than Sbarro.  Sadly, the crust can sometimes be as hard as cardboard.  So after two and a half years, which one do I believe is closest to tasting like a New York pie?  \\n\\nWell... it may be the nearby Philly steak place Corleone's.  Go figure!\n\nStars:",

        "Review: I concur with the prior reviewer...this place is horrible to deal with. RUN, DON'T WALK away from this company. They have the most unresponsive customer service program around, they do not deliver what they promise, and they consistently fail to maintain adequate contact with their customers. I have tried to contact management in the past to deal with my complaints, but they shield themselves with rather powerless customers service reps....sending their reps \\\"into the trenches\\\" as it were while the middle managers hide from any responsiveness and responsibility. The CSRs (once you can get them) are polite and concerned but clearly without adequate information or authority necessary to resolve a problem. Find another company to get your medical supplies from, this one is owned and run by hucksters and sham artists....that....or incredibly inept business managers! It is apparent that all they care about is the profit with no concern about the consumers they are supposed to serve.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

Had to order from the margarita menu & buy an extra shot of tequila to offset the strong sweet  sour mix. They have the best smooth/ taco sauce but not provided. Chips were cold like out of a bag. I requested extra garnish with my red chili burro, barely got normal amount but didn't get a chance to ask for more, she dropped food and left quickly and did not see her again until we were done.

        "Review: I have to say, Yelpers. We have it pretty good in Phoenix!\\n\\nI fly a LOT. Over the last year, I've taken about  dozen business trips - a few of them multi-leg. In 2007 I took just over 20 trips. So, hardly a month goes by where I'm not flying. I spend a LOT of time at airports all over the country.\\n\\nWhen people talk about Sky Harbor, they mostly mean terminals 3 and 4. 2 is primarily international. \\n\\n4 is the newer of the terminals. 3 is older, but still not bad. Southwest and US Airways use Terminal 4, both of which are popular airlines in AZ.\\n\\nEither of them are pretty good compared to many other cities. Especially terminal 4 which is crowded but plush by airport standards.\\n\\nFree wifi. Plenty of AC power plugs for laptops and other devices. Lots of dining options - both behind and in front of the security checkpoint. Clean and plentiful bathrooms. \\n\\nSometimes the security line is long. Sometimes it isn't. It isn't the airports fault - they are all manned by the same idiot TSA employees, no matter the airport. The airport doesn't hire these mouth breathers, only the Federal Government is capable of hiring incompetents on such a massive scale. :) And they hire the false security guards for every airport. They'll give you and granny a body cavity search while the guy in the Osama bin Ladin t-shirt or whatever goes right through. Oh well!\\n\\nThe luggage pick up areas are easy to navigate. The airport is clean. There are lots of parking options. We have the largest car rental lot in the country. If you're waiting to pick someone up and you're early, look for the 'cell phone lot' signs, and hang there until your visitor shows up and calls. It's right next to the pick up area. \\n\\nI mean- compare it to other airports. JFK? JFK is a dirty shithole with a serious mouse problem. O'Hare is a running joke. San Diego - all best dining options are outside the security gate. WTF?\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

It's enough food for a second meal for most. Who can beat that? Pretty much anything and everything is offered under this lunch special as well. What a deal!\\n\\nGreat egg rolls, Very good Rangoon!

They emphasize quality over quantity and for me, they get it right.  I appreciate that they go out of their way to always feature about a dozen PA breweries.  I love that.\\n\\nThe food is so far beyond typical pub fare that that it's hard to compare to anyone else.  The quality is incredible.  The Scotch Eggs ($7.95) are a transcendental experience.  Of course it may be they last experience you ever have as you are whisked off to the ER to have a Roto-Rooter job on your arteries.\\n\\nTry either the beef or chicken Shepherd's pie ($9.95) and be prepared to moan with delight.  As you can see from the prices there is no need to take out a second mortgage to visit here.  It's really quite reasonable.  \\n\\nThe number choices available for food on Carson Street are phenomenal but much of it is average at best.  Visit Piper's and you'll enjoy some of the finest casual food on the South Side.\n\nReview rating:",

It also wasn't fancy on the inside, but I felt underdressed compared to the other patrons and I showed up by myself with a book...which also made me feel a little out of place once inside.  However, the staff was very friendly and the food is excellent.  Yes, the place is small and on a busy night, I would think it could get cramped.  Yes, as another reviewer pointed out, I was able to hear all the conversations around me.  Since I wasn't trying to talk to anyone myself, I didn't find this annoying.  However I did find it strange/disappointing that the restaurant is BYOB.  Unfortunately, I came empty handed.  Now, to the important thing:  the food.  FABULOUS!  And expensive.  I had the onion tarte as an appetizer.  It came with a small salad on the side.  The tarte was excellent...it reminded me of a very fine quiche.  On the waitresses recommendation I ordered the cod as an entr\\u00e9e.  It is not the cod that is visible on the online menu.  I think it might have been the best fish I've ever had in a restaurant.  It was cooked perfectly and the asparagus/vegetable medley (or whatever it was) that it was served over was to die for.  I completed my meal with a fruit tarte and cup of tea.  Again, the torte was exquisite.  Their food really is amazing.  But with the tip, my meal came to $76.  A little pricey.  My boyfriend was shocked when I told him how much my meal cost.  But the food is truly amazing and I will definitely be going back...and taking him.  But probably only for a special occasion and only when I have a bottle or two of wine in hand.

I tell them I haven't rec'd the paper in weeks & have to restate this.  I get another email the next day replying with the current amount I owe & it has gone up because it's now including the past 24 hours that have gone by since my original email.  A different person replies to each email.\\n\\nThen what happens?  I get a paper delivered to me!\\n\\nNow I call them & of course their whole phone systems is out.\\n\\nFINALLY I get an email stating my account is closed.  \\n\\nEmail is answered in the US & the 800 number is the Phllippines if that helps out anyone else daring to subscribe.  \\n\\nI also previously left a message for some female supervisor in the Charlotte office & never got a return call. \\n\\nYou can't even look up your bill online - it does show you how much you have paid though.

I also ordered roasted pig..the meat was hard and gave just a few strips of crispy skin. Never coming back at this restaurant again and will tell my friends and relatives to avoid it. By the way, this restaurant does not accept credit card. Also, waiters are kinda grouchy, not friendlly and does mot come around to see if you need something. I will not recommend this restaurant.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "Review text:\nAfter reading all of the beaming reviews on this place and checking out the (frequently upkept) website, I took my parents here for Sunday brunch.\\n\\nI got the fish and chips. The fish itself was great, but not as hot and crisp as it could have been. It'd probably been sitting under the lamps for too long. The fries were the same bland frozen fry you'd get at any other restaurant in existence, which was disappointing. My dad really enjoyed his huge open face beef sandwich, and my mom found the banger sandwich bland with too much bread. Mashed potatoes were great, and so was the whiskey gravy.\\n\\nEveryone's right about the 4 onion soup. Get it. It's amazing. I could've used more cheese crouton, but I'm also a glutton. \\n\\nI tried a bite of the coleslaw, flavorless. And I think there was something wrong with their tap system when we came in. Our Harp had no head, and neither did the Guinness at the next table. Not okay. \\n\\nI can appreciate that their website has an updated beer and whiskey list with prices. And that they don't go too far with the theme. And giant portions for reasonable prices. It was a 'miss' this time, but I'd love to come back again and try the shephard's pie or the Guinness stew.

I'm a believer. It has this crispy outer area and is drenched in cinnamon sugar, and perfect with syrup or without.  A half order is plenty one, but go all out and get the full order!  You'll be glad you did.\\n\\nPrices are great, I think a burger is under $3.00!  I have never ordered anything other than french toast and hash browns.  The hash browns are darn good too. \\n\\nThe place is a little dumpy- poster boards on the ceiling, really uncomfortable chairs, broken equipment sitting out in the open, tables go uncleaned for awhile.

        "Review: I don't come to Dansey's much anymore but this used to be my favorite hobby shop in Las Vegas.  It was my first choice for model rockets and supplies.  I preferred their old location on North Nellis Blvd.  It was bigger.  The selection was greater.  And they used to have an indoor dirt race track for R/C cars.  It was so much fun to go in there and watch the races.  The newer location now is alright.  It is not as big and parking can be a challenge being in a tiny strip mall.

        "Thomas Street Tavern has become my go-to Plaza Midwood bar -- great patio space, cheap drinks, outdoor games, interesting clientele, and solid bar food.  I didn't know they served food until last night, but man, what a pleasant surprise!  I was expecting the worst because---let's call a spade a spade---Thomas Street is a dive.\\n\\nThe menu is as random as the clientele, but mostly consists of sandwiches.  I had the chili nachos, cheese fries, and BLT with fries (take your judgment elsewhere, it was my cheat meal).  It was all really delicious in the greasy bar food kind of way.  And it was all really cheap.  That being said, the service was kind of shitty.  There was one waitress for the entire patio and she was just so over it... or possibly on drugs.\\n\\nLike I said before, the clientele is interesting, which is both a good and bad thing.  Sometimes interesting means funny and cool; sometimes interesting means super hillbilly and creepy.  I find that you can generally avoid the latter type of interesting by staying in the patio/fire pit area, as they tend to congregate around the pool tables and outside bar.\\n\\nAlso great for nights when you just don't feel like wearing big girl/boy pants.  Nobody here will think less of you for wearing sweatpants and flip flops.\nSo I would like to give it",

        "Review: Religious murals, a candle-laden Catholic altar and arcade games coexisting in the dining room, and tacos. This place is... well, all over the place.\\n\\nTHE GOOD NEWS: they're no longer cash only and accept credit with a 50-cent processing fee. There's also an ATM in the dining room. There's a panaderia next door and a paleteria further down the strip center to continue your Mexicano dining adventure!\\n\\nTHE NOT-SO-GOOD NEWS: Apparently prices have gone up from most of the ones posted on these reviews. Tacos are $1.25-$1.50 each, my two-taco take-out order was basically $3. But when I opened the bag at home, there was a foil packet roughly the size of a slice of cheese. I wondered how they could have given me the wrong order, given that I was one of only two orders at the time.\\n\\nTHE REALITY: My two tacos were both mini-tacos, and the condiment container of grilled onions I'd grabbed at the salsa bar seemed to dwarf the actual tacos. I know street tacos are on corn tortillas and run a smidge smaller at traditional places than, say, Taco Bell or Del Taco, but these were absurdly small.\\nSimilarly-priced tacos at Tacos Gil or the guys on Decatur are all easily twice the size of what I received here. Key words: similarly-priced. \\n\\nThat being said, the lengua taco is fairly good and I liked the mild salsa verde, but the asada was lacking and overpowered by the ranchero-style sauce included when you ask for \\\"everything on it\\\". \\n\\nTHE VERDICT: Disappointing. For tacos, anyway. Maybe I'll go Jade's route and try the soup next time.\\n\\nSide note: also watch out for the guy in the parking lot with a bottle of Windex. He'll spray down your vehicle while you're inside, unprompted, then expect payment afterward.\nOn a scale of 1 to 5, I would give this product",

        "This Caterer entirely ruined my sisters wedding yesterday.  For a small 50 person wedding, the cost was ridiculous and even though they paid their bill in FULL months before the wedding, the caterer was still asking for money up until the day of the event.  The Basic Cake clause in the contract was not explained well.  The catering staff kept asking the family all night for a schedule of things even though it had been provided to them by the bride weeks earlier.  They even cut the cake before the bridal couple cut the cake and were serving it during the toast!  \\n\\nThe food was cold, the displays were well done although very sparse, there was no butter provided for the rolls, salt and pepper was not provided and when asked for, was told that having salt and pepper available would be an insult to the chef.\\n\\nThe staff was supposed to be at the hall at 2:30 PM and didn't show up until after the guests started arriving at 3:45 for a 4 PM wedding.\\n\\nShameful, shameful.

The delivery date was \\\"pushed back\\\" many times until it finally came in over 3 months after they said it would, and gave me the run-around throughout the entire process.  I didn't think my dress was coming at all to be perfectly honest.  I had un-returned phone calls and was lied to by Donetta, the owner.  Janie was the consultant I worked with the most and she was always pleasant and helpful; however, the store overall struggles and I would never go back.  If you are shopping for a wedding dress run far far away from this place.  Seriously, take my word for it.  I ordered my dress well in advance and no one should go through what I went through wondering when you were going to get a straight answer and if your dress was ever going to come.  I have read many negative reviews for this place and still gave them the benefit of the doubt. Shame on me.  Check out the Better Business Bureau (BBB).  Brides by Candalina is rated an F.  They have unresolved isssues with customers and unfortunately they really don't care. Shopping for a wedding dress should be one of the most exciting times of your life, not a nightmare.

        "Review: Pros\\n1. Nice glass selection - unlike Visionworks - they cary high fashion frames like Prada, Burberry, Versace, Polo, Gucci and Ray Ban\\n2. Very organized in their process. They provide you with a lens case, where you select 4-5 frames. You try them on and they take a picture of you with all of them on. \\n3. Fast- Their glasses are done in about an hour like they advertise\\n\\nCons\\n1. Very salesy and they push for features that drive up the cost of the glasses.\\n2. Insurance plan only covers the cheap lenses. The lenses that you want are very expensive and usually over a $100 by themselves not including the frames\\n3. They push for a $35 service fee that is unnecessary in my opinion. It's similar to car rental companies charging for insurance when you already have coverage thru your insurance\\n4. Understaffed - we had to wait a long time before someone helped us.\\n5. They will push for you to buy a second pair of glasses for 40% off to suggest you are getting a deal when in reality the glasses are so marked up that 40% off $300 glasses isn't really a deal.\\n\\nBottomline- can be okay but just be prepared for the upselling. You don't need antireflective coating and other special lenses that your insurance plan doesn't cover. You don't need the repair plan.  You don't need a second pair of glasses.

        "I thought I was going to really impress some friends when they discovered the highly touted \\\"famous\\\" chocolate fountain feature of our surprise Sunday brunch. \\n\\nAllow me to help manage YOUR expectations, so you're not as disappointed as I was: Yes, there is a chocolate fountain and it is included with your $8-13 brunch entree; but, buy your own(probably identical) model at Wal-mart for $40 and save yourself the heartache of a disappointing meal. \\n\\nGranted, we came for the \\\"famous\\\" chocolate fountain but we were prepared to enjoy breakfast first! Another disappointment. \\n\\nI had the breakfast burrito and could only stomach the beans. The potatoes tasted like they'd been in the freezer too long. The eggs in my burrito were chewy not \\\"lightly\\\" scrambled in the slightest.  The machaca had decent flavor but it was further ruined by the enchilada sauce that tasted straight from a generic can!\\n\\nOne of my guests had pancakes. Sadly, these were neither light nor fluffy, instead they were chewy and tough just like my eggs.\\n\\n \\\"The myriad of accompaniments you can serve with the chocolate fountain are only limited by your imagination\\\" in theory, but at Aunt Chilada's this past Sunday, your choices were dry chunks of cantaloupe, flavorless honeydew, pineapple cubes, (shall we say \\\"aged\\\") marshmallows, and the unimaginative standby: strawberries. Oh! And, crispy lady fingers. \\n\\nFull disclosure: I did not tell our server how much I hated my burrito or the pancakes and she DID ask how everything tasted. \\n\\nTruthfully: I was weary from the disappointment. It's one thing to send back an entree but to say everything was unsatisfactory?! I just won't recommend it or plan to return.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "Review text:\nI can probably best sum my opinion of this place up by saying that I could see this restaurant on Restaurant Impossible.  I won't dwell on the service, about which many have commented (which I could actually deal with if the food were good).  I'll start with the fact that none of the wine glasses set up at our table looked clean (all had some white-ish film and mine had a little extra something on it).  That's not acceptable at the prices they charge.  The real problem is the food.  We ordered chopped green salads that were something that looked like a 7-year old could make.  The toasted ravioli may daughters ordered looked and tasted like something you can try in the aisles of Costco on Saturday morning.  The quality of our steaks wasn't bad, but they weren't very juicy.  Of the 4 steaks we ordered, only one was cooked to the medium-rare that we asked for.  The others were medium to medium-well.  I ordered steak fries that were actually seasoned well, but were undercooked and looked like slightly higher quality than something you'd find in an elementary school lunch.  We ordered bananas foster (table-side service) for dessert.  it was kind of a fun process watching it flame up.  Taste-wise, it was just a sugar-bomb with only half a banana in it.  I'll sum up with 3 notes.\\n\\n1.  I went here on the recommendation of my best friend, who is a certified foodie.  However, my wife reminded me after our beyond-disappointing-for-the-price meal that my friend is Hindu and generally doesn't eat beef (so maybe he doesn't know it when beef isn't great?).\\n\\n2.  My wife said the best dish was the broccoli (which was a single steamed, unseasoned crown).  To be fair, my wife really liked her apple-tini.\\n\\n3.  My daughters' comment after dinner:  \\\"The water was nice and cold.\\\"\\n\\nIf people like the historical significance of this place, maybe it should be converted into a museum.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Review text:\nI was in the Phoenix Airport last week while connecting from DC to ABQ. As I was asking for directions to the terminal for my connection, I was told that I would have to go outside and get on a shuttle bus. Seriously???? You're telling me I have to go outside and go through security AGAIN? Yes, that's exactly what they were telling me. Needless to say, I was not a happy camper to learn that if you connect to a different terminal you have to go BACK through security.....not fun!\\n\\nIt just seems like in this day and age there has to be a better way to get travelers from one terminal to another without causing such a hassle.\n\nReview rating:",

        "Not too bad, but nothing to write home about. The room was decent, I had no real complaints about it, the only real pain was the check in process really. They had some rule that I had to go get my girlfriend out of the car and have her give her ID before I check in. The hell? Only hotel in the country I ever had to do that in, I also saw some rule about no guests after 11:00. Look I was on a road trip so I could care less, and I'm assuming this is some anti-prostitution thing, or being in Arizona maybe it's some anti immigration thing. Either way it was annoying after driving for so long, and standing in a long line.\\n\\nHotel is decent, worth the discounted price I paid for it, but next time I'd rather go some where I don't feel so spied on. They have a security guard just standing watch outside, normally I guess I'd feel safe, but I just felt weird. Probably a good place to bring the family though, but make sure they all have ID's. My rating for this place is",

        "Went here for restaurant week and was impressed.  My two companions both got the steak, and I swear it was a competition as to who could down it first.  My goat cheese appetizer was amazing, the salmon was great, and the bed of brown rice had been flavored perfectly...I usually don't eat brown rice but this was delicious.  All three courses were fantastic, the wine was good, service was good and the atmosphere was good - the old house does make it a little Charleston-ish, but this whole area of Charlotte is filled with similar places, so 300 doesn't stand out in that regard. My rating for this place is",

        "Review text:\nThe ideal customer for this store is someone who is heavily armed and who has the patience of Ghandi. You would need both to safely navigate the waters of this disastrous store.\\n\\nThis is the nearest grocer for downtown residents, and it is sad that this store misses the mark by such a huge margin.\\n\\nOn any day, the parking lot is covered in grease, coffee, and trash. IF by some miracle you are able to get inside without being hit up for money by tweakers, then the heavens are smiling on you.\\n\\nOnce inside the store, your adventure is just starting. The characters inside the store are the inspiration for the bar scene in Star Wars. Very random and sketchy. As far as the contents of the store, to be fair they have all the stuff you need, and at a reasonable price point.\\n\\nThe huge problem here, is everything else. During peak hours, they have very few lanes open, that is a consistent failure with this store. Customer service is also dead here, and they just don't know how to take care of customers. I feel as though the broken window theory is at play here. It seems like because they don't take care of the parking lot, and other details, the whole place goes to hell. The store also has a serious shoplifting problem. I'm not sure if they just don't staff the loss prevention unit, or if they are inept, but I have seen at least four episodes where a cashier is confronting a thief. It makes for an unsafe situation for everyone. They do have private security there, and the guys seem really nice, but clearly in over their heads. At this point the store is so far gone, they really need off-duty police officers to make it safe.\\n\\nIt really seems like this store just doesn't give a shit. At each opportunity to impress, the complete opposite happens. This place is a huge safety problem, and I would hate to have my sisters or Mom go to this place, it's really that shady. See for yourself, but be on your toes.\n\nStars:",

        "This is an unfortunate review to make.  I believe that Yelp has to tell the good and the bad equally.  I manage multiple apartments and am always having keys made.  I use multiple locksmiths but this one is the closest to a cluster of my apartments.\\nToday I went in to have keys made and there was an honest mistake made by an employee.  He had cut the keys on the wrong blank.  Never before had such a thing been a big deal but the owner wanted me to pay for the mistake.  \\nHe seemed to understand that there was an innocent mistake made by his employee, but he still wanted me to pay for it. \\nI will taking my business to a more reasonable company from now on.\\nIts important to say that the shop absolutely REEKS of cigarettes, it's so bad I try to wait outside.\n===\nBased on that, my rating is",

        "I have been coming to Silver Touch since I have been driving. It used to be a Weiss Guys, but was bought out by another member of the family. Everytime I have brought a vehicle here they have done a great job. They offer many services and options for your individual needs. The prices are reasonable and they offer a discount if you come back in a week. With the monsoon season upon us this could come in handy. I drive the 15 minutes to get my car washed here. It's what I know. Maybe I'm afraid of change?\nSo I would like to give it",
